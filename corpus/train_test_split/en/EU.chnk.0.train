Despite this progress , much work needs to be done . #% Furthermore , the public have a right to know what preparations are being made , what types of materials are threatening and what impacts may be expected . #% The unique role of farmers as environmental managers must also be fully recognised , appreciated and rewarded . #% Things have now ground to a halt and if Member States genuinely wish to create a citizens ' Europe the progress must be made in the area of justice and home affairs . #% I would like to thank the Irish presidency because it was , as stated in Mr Clegg 's report , positive in ensuring we came to a final conclusion . #% As the Commissioner himself pointed out , investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards . #% It is simply not acceptable , Mr Commissioner . #% Mr Bowis mentioned the case of Dr Shipman , a doctor in my constituency who may have murdered up to 200 patients after forcing some of them to change their wills in his favour . #% Effective leadership for all our credit unions on the island of Ireland is provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions . #% It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse , technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection . #% Madam President , I would first like to thank the Commissioner for bringing forward the original document which is the base for this report . #% Neither the corrupt elite in Pakistan , represented by the present government , nor the main opposition party , have any answers for the people . #% in writing . - I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the individual paragraphs of , and amendments to , the joint resolution . #% Of course , our birth rate has fallen remarkably since about 1980 , but we still have one of the highest proportions of young people in our population . #% The end result should put beyond doubt the quality and safety of all food products , and provide the assurances consumers have been seeking and to which they are entitled . #% Mr President , on a point of order : I would like to request the assistance of my colleagues in Parliament , and indeed of the Commission , following the disaster that struck Dublin in particular last week when it was inundated with serious floods , rendering homeless many frightened people , some elderly . #% If the Commission can be blamed for anything it is for failing to do its own public relations work , to stand up for itself and to stand up to the national governments when they are in breach of the regulations . #% Could he give us some idea of exactly what is on the table and what is being offered to Iran in these circumstances ? #% The real issue is that we should set realistically attainable targets and timetables and insist on the Irish , Greeks , Portuguese and others delivering on time , with no excuses . #% Those are natural disagreements , which we can have . #% Our citizens expect and , indeed , demand that we do better . #% Small local cottage industries have great scope for boosting local economies . #% I say this because now the European Union governments are discussing what I would describe as the bottom-line issues relating to areas of concern with regard to the likely provisions of the new European Union Treaty . #% Mr President , with acute drug-related deaths standing at 7,000 to 8,000 a year , my Group will be supporting very strongly the report by Mr Oostlander and the fight against illicit drug trafficking . #% in writing . - Access to Early Years Learning is of vital importance to young children in terms of their receptiveness and willingness to learn , especially since important skills such as the ability to speak and develop social skills are formed at a young age . #% You can not have single-sex hospitals . #% We have not calculated the cost of that decommissioning in the correct place , and it is currently , completely irregularly , being put into a research budget . #% There is also a need for a Europe-wide epidemiological study which should be financed by the European Union , and that should be done as a matter of urgency . #% Complex or not , the petitioners have a right to know why European Union rules for the regulation of Lloyd 's were not properly implemented . #% As a representative of an Objective 1 region in the north and west of Ireland , I am very conscious of the benefit of every single euro invested in an effort to redress the economic and socio-economic imbalance in the Union . #% We really have to take into account all sectors in the community . #% For too long in Europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem . #% Having expressed my opposition to many aspects previously , I will be happy to support Mr Wuermeling 's report provided the amendments on so-called ` responsible lending ' , the compulsory use of credit reference databases and the exemption for mortgages are all adopted , and provided the so-called credit union amendments , 4 and 61 , are supported by this House . #% Mr President , I wish to restate here this morning my confidence in Commissioner Fischler 's handling of the BSE crisis . #% Let me say that we should , in any case , be making more use of indigenous energy sources and not relying so much upon imported fuels . #% Again , I congratulate you and wish you well . #% Unemployment is falling within the European Union and in Ireland it stands at a little over 6 % of the population . #% So what are you going to say to the stakeholders in January , Commissioner ? #% Mr President , for a moment I thought we were being left out . #% This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact . #% We must be on guard though about bringing pet animals in from third countries , because any cases of rabies which are found in the EU at the moment come from third countries where rabies is still endemic . #% My group , however , again wishes to stress the importance that this should be seen in the context of a strong Atlantic Alliance . #% I do not take advantage in that way to make a point of order which is not relevant . #% The Member States are unwilling to concede to the European Union the full responsibility for a comprehensive policy but are always willing to blame the European Union for the negative factors . #% Because of that , I have had an increasingly heavy work load in relation to this issue . #% Therefore , it is fully deserving of support from the Commission and a budget line should be set up to promote the tourism sector . #% The European Commission has brought forward a proposal which is designed to establish a new European Maritime Safety Agency . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Grossetête for her report . #% As far as my group is concerned , the purpose of the European process is to ensure that this kind of horror never happens again . #% That is also somewhat surrealistic . #% The British decision to disrupt Community business is wrong . #% They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species . #% Chad : #% I would just like to discuss the issue of Chechnya and our continued support for the Russian Government . #% Finally , I would like to draw colleagues ' attention to the initiative of a number of Member States along the Atlantic north-west to establish particularly sensitive sea areas . #% But you should watch and be fair , Mr President . #% My question pertains particularly to radioactive emissions . #% The wars in the Balkans in recent years have been conveniently forgotten when fiery advocates of an almighty Europe tell us the new Europe has prevented and stopped wars . #% I do think , however , that had we tried , we could have found an older woman who could have also made an important contribution to the praesidium . #% In the coming years , Chinese requirements alone will increase to unheard-of levels . #% Why should we in this Parliament agree to funding any nuclear budget at all under the Euratom budget when Parliament is not able to approve such policies and they are not part of the treaties of the European Union . #% Whilst Members may criticise his political skills or his unwillingness to give them the answers to the questions they wanted , at least give him recognition for the courtesy of coming to us . #% However , the way to do that is not by legalisation . #% in writing . - We have voted overwhelmingly today to maintain the political momentum behind a global financial transaction tax ( FTT ) . #% It is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful side-effect of the fishing industry . #% Can I just raise one typical example of an area in which we have no comeback : that of a Member State failing to act on a European Union directive . #% 
Maritime safety is also becoming a more important political issue within the European Union . #% We , as legislators , have a responsibility to ensure that we bring the people with us and keep in touch with their everyday concerns #% In line with our traditional policy of military neutrality , Ireland is not bound by any mutual defence commitment . #% Whereas I understand that one million jobs are expected to be created over the next 12 months , the unemployment rate would still remain stubbornly high , at about 8.4 % . #% Mr President , I want to make it clear that this should not be an inquiry into the disaster off the Spanish/French coast : it concerns the safety of the entire European coastline . #% We all know that the last two to three months have been an enduring exercise for political leaders within the EU . #% In particular , I refer to paragraph 20 which recommends that the total or partial substitution of ` physical ' investments by the supply of adequate telecommunications services in such a way as to minimize the cost of investment and the constraints on the environment be systematically included as part of the evaluation process of investments financed by the structural funds and be a substantial part of the national programmes as presented in the framework of these funds . #% However , from what we see from some of the people proposing some of the amendments and from some of the lobbying that has taken place on this issue , they simply want a free-for-all : no protection within the European Union , and what would that lead to ? #% An explicit reference to the application of ICAT rules should be included in the text of the next protocol . #% I am very pleased that Mr Mombaur accepts the target of 15 % of primary energy by the year 2010 , a target set in the Madrid Conference and in the action plan following that conference recently followed up in Milan . #% I welcome the statement of the Palestinian authority which has declared that it will take action against terrorism while Prime Minister Barak has informally given an understanding that he will try to limit the expansion of settlements . #% I think there are only nine Member States -- if my facts are correct -- that have the benefit of this . #% We know what our collective challenges are in this regard , so let us go and meet them . #% I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region . #% It is about time the EU owned up to its responsibility and made it impossible for light arms to be traded like this , causing the death and destruction of many innocent people . #% The EU-based and the US-based multinationals participate in this exploitation to facilitate their super profits . #% The 25 sovereign governments in their wisdom have given their support to Mr Barroso and , if for no other reason , that is enough for me to give him my support . #% This latter point is of particular importance to me and my constituents in the Province of Leinster . #% The framework programme for additional funds to research geological disposal of radioactive waste means that EU-funded research for what is effectively a commercial waste problem represents yet another subsidy to the nuclear industry . #% It was not possible to schedule a debate on this report ; there are no amendments ; we are voting because we want to now open discussions with the Council and the Commission . #% Mr President , like previous speakers I , too , am gravely concerned that since last December the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated to a new low . #% Mr President , for 16 years now the family of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane has campaigned for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his murder . #% The quality of our agricultural products is something that needs to be capitalised on . #% Although there are difficulties with the two directives and liberalization , it is part of creating Europe and lower prices do benefit people . #% I appeal to the Commission and to the Council to insist that the Irish Government reverse its decision to abandon the carbon tax . #% That defeats additionality and cheats a region like mine out of funds intended by Europe to provide true additional expenditure there . #% It would be wrong for us in Europe to ignore what is happening . #% The President-in-Office will have the primary responsibility for guiding negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Treaties . #% The summit meeting in Cardiff provides an ideal opportunity for the European Union to assess how best it can aid the process of peace and reconciliation which was given this overwhelming support by the Irish people and the referendum . #% Anyone who knows the short history of the European Union and the long history of Europe will know that proud states are not going to dance at the crack of a whip by the European Commission . #% Another company much smaller , much bigger are paying considerably higher wages than Ryanair . #% Unfortunately , much of that aid is of very little use to developing countries unless we also make trade work for them . #% No virus has the capacity to comprehend the notions of subsidiarity , proportionality and territoriality . #% We are all aware of why these species are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation , as Mr Stevenson pointed out in his introduction . #% Inaccurate and uncontrolled declarations are useless and bring the whole system into disrepute . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her answer . #% The veterinary experts have told me that they are quite appalled at the apathy of the government in this field . #% The first concerns the whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi . #% Equality of education means that people must have the skills that are required for the jobs that are going to be available . #% Under the next CAP , the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced . #% There is tension , even within the EU , as to how it should be handled . #% Resources should not come from existing budgets and from money that has been promised ; there have to be new resources . #% 500 of these 7 000 athletes will be coming from areas affected by SARS . #% Our committee is not a court of law ; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability , given the evidence available . #% That certainly is not my intention . #% He is subject to very severe , cruel and unusual restrictions on his liberty . #% Mr President , medicinal products are something quite ordinary and everyday . #% Given the most recent studies , it is clear that it is technically possible that 95 % of our energy supplies could come from renewables like wind , tidal , wave , solar and biomass by 2050 . #% These are issues that need to be addressed and the Irish Government and its agencies need to be cross-examined by this committee , as , indeed , do many other Member States . #% Finally , the promotion of encryption can not be a substitute for efforts to find political solutions - more strict legal guarantees and effective parliamentary control , for example . #% I presume he has answered many of the questions the public in general have been asking , but I am not sure if those answers will be to their satisfaction . #% I can not accept that it should apply to core public services . #% I have to say that I , and I think my colleagues in this House , sense a threat in some areas . #% The other major downside is that ten weeks have gone by arguing about peripheral issues such as the ban on derivatives while ignoring the real fears of consumers and the plight of beef producers . #% As we fast approach enlargement , this must remain high on the agenda so that the standards which European consumers have come to expect can be maintained . #% I propose today that some financial reserve be provided within the agricultural budget to address such emergency eventualities when they occur . #% I believe that a country seeking to join the European Union must clearly comply with all aspects of the Copenhagen criteria . #% I recognise that it is not an easy task because chemical precursors have a legal use as well as being a key part of illicit drug production . #% This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean . #% I agree totally with Sophia in ' t Veld . #% They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community . #% Then , in classic IRA style , the intimidation brigade swung into action to silence the witnesses . #% It is disappointing that these issues are not dealt with as a whole and cohesive strategy . #% Mr President , we welcome the recent announcement by the Americans that they are starting to think multilaterally once again . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Spanish Presidency for its very professional and successful approach to its many responsibilities and obligations . #% I would like an assurance from the Council that the EU Commission will actually step aside from the process on this and allow the people to make up their own mind and that it will be in accordance with the constitution of Ireland which prohibits the use of public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum . #% 
Did the EU Commission see the headline in the Financial Times yesterday : ` Traders in record bet against the euro ' ? #% In these difficult times , our primary aim must be , as this joint resolution says , to protect EU citizens , whether workers , entrepreneurs , householders , from the effects of the crisis . #% It is important , in view of safety , that the Commission carries out an assessment of the impact of the regulation on rosters and operating models and , in the event that they are adversely affected , the Commission should carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations . #% Mr President , in his report Mr Mombaur has certainly given a comprehensive coverage of the implications of the liberalization of these markets . #% How can the Member States , including Ireland , contribute more to the fight against all forms of violence against children ? #% Credit must therefore be accorded to the Italian presidency for the significant progress that it made on very sensitive issues . #% The mission must , at all times , act independently and be seen to do so . #% I have no fault to find with the way the Commission interacted with the agriculture industry over the years . #% I am very glad that he is not as ill as he looked , but we must have resuscitative equipment in the House , given not only the conditions but some of our ages and I include myself in that . #% I congratulate the rapporteur and the committee for bringing it forward . #% I want to ask the Commissioner very straightforwardly and point-blank whether the Commission , and Parliament , and the European Union are being held to ransom by Morocco because of its unwillingness to agree . #% However , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern . #% Smoking causes 85 % of all cases of lung cancer and half of all premature deaths among life-long smokers are caused by the use of tobacco . #% While I support voluntary commitments in general , if they are not seen to be effective then the European Union governments and institutions will have no option other than to legislate on this matter . #% Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank President Barroso for coming to the Chamber . #% That we have close to 70 million people living at risk in the European Union is a shameful statistic and is not acceptable . #% Our objective should always be to achieve the Millennium Development Goals . #% We are now reaping the harvest of its inaction . #% Mr President , right at the outset I salute the superb courage of the McCartney family . #% Other matters will be dealt with in the fullness of time by the Italian electorate and presumably also the Italian courts . #% For example , some gears have a higher by-catch than others or inflict more severe damage on the sea bottom . #% The negotiations which brought about the internal market and the single European currency were difficult but were always based on the premise that stability of the European Union is paramount at all times . #% . Mr President , obviously it will not be possible in five minutes to do justice to the issue . #% Indeed if she was misrepresented or misreported in the newspapers I would suggest that , on the issue of substance on which she was actually quoted , she should withdraw or substantiate . #% Again , Goldstone is clear : these detentions of PLC members are contrary to international law . #% Advertising does have an influence in promoting smoking ; that is why all Member States in Europe have rules which restrict or ban tobacco advertising in some shape or form . #% He was crying crocodile tears at the weekend over this event yet he has tightened the laws in Ireland in every possible way to ensure that asylum-seekers do not come to Ireland to file an application for refugee status , which I would like to reiterate is something that they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention . #% We often hide behind structural deficiencies and I would certainly acknowledge that there are structural deficiencies , not least the requirement for unanimity . #% Hopefully , good sense will prevail tomorrow and we will put in place a report that we can stand over . #% We did ourselves debate the whole question of the harmonisation of the pharmaceutical industry . #% Already I understand four states , Ireland , Denmark , Sweden and Netherlands have given such an indication . #% We have delivered on our commitments , we must now ensure that we can deliver on our future promises for the future generations in Europe . #% When one takes into consideration that SMEs are responsible for up to 80 % of new jobs created over the past five years , this highlights the potential for job-creation in small to medium-sized industry and also the need for Parliament and governments to create the economic environment for their continued growth . #% It is important that they are not only entitled but also encouraged to do so . #% To be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support . #% I support the objective of this directive to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste , as long as the costs are proportionate to the environmental benefits . #% First , the UNIFIL peace-keeping/peace enforcement mission in Lebanon . #% However , it is essential that a mechanism is constructed to deal with the other public health issues and potential outbreaks , and not just the diseases listed in the compromise deal . #% Sadly , we lost one of the driving forces with the sudden death , earlier this year , of John Bonda , but others will carry on his work in the Export Council . #% I warn that unless we become more vigilant and show a greater understanding of the unique and irreplaceable role of farmers in society , future generations and parliamentarians will be forced to react to save agriculture . #% That seems to me to be a contradiction in terms . #% Let me say to the President-in-Office that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well , and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda 2000 which are now more essential than ever . #% I can assure the Commission and the Council presidency that we will use these powers rigorously in the future . #% As noted previously , these additional costs will ultimately be borne in high electricity prices . #% I want to make a few things clear here at the outset . #% The role of the European Investment Bank in the structuring and operation of the guarantee fund , as currently proposed , is central . #% I hope his views as endorsed by Parliament will be heeded and reflected in the full version of the Agenda 2000 proposals . #% I am generally in favour of Article 175 but against extra bans . #% The argument has been made that this issue should instead be covered by horizontal legislation . #% I oppose the Constitution because I dare still to cling to a belief in maximising meaningful national sovereignty . #% Peace can only be built on parity of esteem , where there is respect for the territorial integrity and the rights of each group . #% It sets standards in environment , it sets goals for research and development , it helps to add something to the global challenge for European industry . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by complimenting Vice-President Gutiérrez Díaz on his interesting and thought-provoking report . #% Basically what Mr Arias Cañete wants to do is continue with the existing system which rejects changes and improvements proposed by the Commission . #% Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to come back and respond briefly to the debate so far . #% Mr President , ideally GMOs should not be released into the environment . #% There is a significant step which the Commission could take with regard to this and that would be to abandon its ridiculous age-discrimination policies . #% There is already a need for EU legislation to make Member States take account of the need for the adequate separation of plants posing major hazards from population centres . #% That is how terrorist organisations think and work , as they fight their long , multi-faceted war . #% Therefore it is appropriate that it is probably the most important report for fishermen in the last five years . #% In the Senegal Agreement this requirement is far more constraining so that vessels can lose their licences for failure to comply . #% It was a fascinating exercise . #% It is amazing that in the European Union we only have two or three companies or people providing insurance for aircraft . #% With regard to the reform of the EU agricultural system , Commissioner Mandelson has succeeded in the negotiating mandate given to him by the EU governments . #% Therefore I am recommending a negative vote in relation to these areas . #% How can the Commission claim to advocate a safer working environment for fishermen and crew members while at the same time penalising the owners of the vessels who want to carry out measures to improve safety on board ? #% 
Mr President , first I should like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Presidentin-Office of the Italian presidency at a most difficult time , in fact at a time of European Union institutional crisis . #% For that reason it is important that the IGC does not take any step backwards . #% The Greek Presidency has set a good example of how a presidency should be conducted on behalf of all the Member States and others will do well to follow this example . #% Each year , more people die as a result of heroin addiction in Ireland than die in car accidents . #% The Commission should consider using Article 182 ( 5 ) as a legal basis for all future proposals for joint programming of research activities . #% Unfortunately , only 2 % of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education . #% Your personal efforts and the work with the High Representative , Commissioner Patten and others , particularly in Macedonia , where the situation remains so explosive and difficult , show impressive commitment towards pressing ahead with a common foreign and security policy . #% There are now people in this Parliament who know what it is like not to have freedom to speak , not to have the freedom to use their own language and not to have the right to teach their own history and culture to their children . #% Does the Commission not agree that if a product or food producer causes an alert then it is both in the consumer 's interest and indeed in the interest of the open market that this information should be made public ? #% For this reason in particular it is a great shame - if I may say so , coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral - that the obligations , responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union , and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty . #% The main costs of the crisis have so far been borne by taxpayers . #% If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union , it is here . #% Now we have been given a new opportunity to do something . #% Unfortunately , that government does not seem to be very prominent in promoting that policy , even though it was adopted back in July 2002 . #% Difference in religion , nationality and race . #% In relation to the access to medical and veterinary products for horses , we also have to take into account the whole issue of animal welfare problems . #% I feel disappointed , too , at the broken understanding , if not broken promise , and the failure of the Council of Ministers to recognize the European Parliament 's codecision powers . #% We should remember the experience of Maastricht . #% We want a simpler and more certain tax-based definition than that proposed by the Commission . #% This is a problem we should be aware of in the European Union , with its share of world trade , with its economic weight in the world and with the political clout that it undoubtedly has . #% I cite qualified majority voting as an example . #% The Commission and the Member States have taken the necessary steps , with the full co-operation of the farming community and the beef industry , to guarantee safe farming and food production practices and a safe product for the European consumer as well as for our vital export markets . #% Again people in Ireland should not listen to those who preach about militarism , for this is a false premise . #% Our strategy requires not only that people be given training and skills but also that there be no discrimination between men and women . #% The specific proposal is part of a number of measures presently being proposed by the Committee on Transport of this Parliament to improve the quality and safety standards of air travel for all users . #% It has been estimated that 100 of the largest companies in Ireland will exceed the current emission rates between 2005 and 2007 . #% The principal message of the Small Business Act is to ` think small first ' - to concentrate business legislation across the EU on small and medium-sized enterprises - and the EU has committed tonight to continue the focus on this area . #% I wish to say , firstly , that we should leave this discussion to another time , because it should be debated . #% We have to look at the societal implications of ICT , the environmental benefits that can come from it with things like less travelling to work . #% Mr President , when this Parliament last met it quite properly condemned the Nazi atrocities epitomised by Auschwitz . #% At this stage I would like the Council to offer some hope in a very important area where there is obviously not enough work being done to promote this important aspect of education . #% I am sorry to say I do not find your answer quite sufficient in relation to the export refunds . #% So , having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases -- the main thrust being environment , with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base -- the Council handed the baton back to Parliament . #% We are debating human rights issues right across the world and we can not ignore what happens in our own Member States . #% The OECD calls a spade a spade . #% It is a direct challenge to the European Union and is part of the attempt by the United States to establish superiority in every region throughout the world . #% In the last few years happily , there has been an increase in marriages between citizens from different countries , but this brings with it also its own problems . #% In my view this is compatible with the Convention of the Rights of the Child . #% This would restrict emissions within the European Union in the long term while advancing a strategy which would minimize the economic cost as a whole . #% Significant price fluctuations are occurring from year to year , and indeed from month to month , and are often due to factors beyond our control , such as the global financial crisis and , indeed , the price of oil . #% As we look to the future , we must also remember ` the past ' , the ideals of the founders of the European Economic Community . #% The key , of course , is resolution to the intractable problem of the Middle East . #% Given the establishment of the internal market and the imminent introduction of the single currency , consumer policy must be implemented on a pan-European basis rather than by Member States acting alone . #% Mr President , the hearings in Parliament and the confirmation vote which we have later today on the president , vice-president , and Executive Board members for the Central Bank mark for this House the last significant step in the beginning of a very significant and historic enterprise for Europe . #% Amendments to the Treaties have to be agreed by European Union leaders and any proposals emanating from this Convention must be balanced , progressive and achievable . #% It happened when I saw disabled people protesting in the rain outside the transport company because of the fact that new buses had been acquired with EU structural fund money and that they were not accessible . #% Hopefully , again it is only a suspect case and will remain so . #% I have had the privilege to visit that plant on behalf of my party in Ireland on two occasions , one of which was the NIREX inquiry . #% I thank the Commissioner for her work in this area . #% We want to see the creation of a European rating system for child-friendly Internet providers and the display of child safety messages . #% We have failed , in my view , to communicate Europe . #% I have also received the same notice as Mr McMahon and I agree with him fully . #% Mr Söderman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe . #% I would ask the President-in-Office whether she would take into consideration the initiative taken by both Ireland and the UK in relation to technical conservation measures and see that some effort is made by all countries to try to ensure that the smaller fish are not taken on board . #% It is vital to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance and aid to Gaza without delay . #% I am supportive of the principle of Turkish accession , but recognise that it will be a long , hard road . #% Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century . #% The continuation of the LFA scheme is vital if we are to compensate farmers for providing public goods , avoiding land abandonment , assisting in promoting biodiversity and helping to support rural communities . #% We should note , in my view , with alarm the reluctance of young people to take up farming and ponder the consequences for food security and employment in the agricultural food sector . #% My colleagues from the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and myself welcomed the particular agreement with the Republic of Yemen in December . #% The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive , which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002 . #% I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today . #% The intention to place the reinforcement of European security and defence policy high on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council is an appropriate one . #% Such a centre could be incorporated into an established body or foundation through the enlargement of existing competences , as proposed in the PSE resolution . #% Figures show that visitor growth is concentrated mainly on the east coast of Ireland around the capital , Dublin . #% While I am not familiar with the situation in other European countries , I know that in Ireland we do not have an adequate number of inspectors and monitors to ensure the health and safety of our own workers . #% 
I endorse the proposal to establish a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships as it takes on board many of Parliament 's proposals . #% One of the most important issues we need to stress here tonight is that this Parliament has the ability , the innovation and indeed the skill to meet deadlines . #% Mr President , I address my remarks to the Stevenson report only . #% If we add to this lost national revenues and damage to the environment and to biodiversity we see that Mexico 's experience of seeking to develop its agricultural sector through trade liberalisation has had devastating consequences . #% That is why the Walter report is such an excellent one , because it puts forward constructive policies on how we can help those countries move into EMU and into the third phase faster . #% Nowadays we often hear the claim that the world is at your fingertips : one click and you have access to the whole world . #% I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States , for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations . #% The Russian crisis could roll the clock back in spite of the great historic changes that have taken place . #% In insisting on the political reflection of the outcome of the recent European Parliament elections within the European Commission , how far should we go in restricting the choice of and dictating to national governments their selection of Commissioner ? #% To this end , we do not tar all the outgoing Commission with the same brush . #% It takes 9 out of 15 members of the UN Security Council to sign a motion to put the issue on the agenda . #% We must continue to be very active in encouraging movement on both sides . #% IRA Army Council member ` Slab ' Murphy is a leading crime boss in Ireland presiding over a border empire built on fuel smuggling . #% Clearly , a multi-faceted approach is needed if we are to guarantee that the roots of international terrorism are tackled head-on . #% To highlight this minister 's hypocrisy further : yesterday , for the first time in the history of the Geneva Convention , there was a meeting of the 141 countries that signed that Convention in 1951 . #% In particular , in paragraph 6 , we call for an open and candid dialogue . #% I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that , in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland , Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon , one of the world 's biggest arms manufacturing companies . #% I shall be contacting the Commissioner responsible with a view to obtaining further information on this matter . #% There is one overriding and general concern , the sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives . #% We should fully recognise that the Palestinians and the Israeli Government are now negotiating on bottom line issues , including the status of Jerusalem , the borders of the Palestinian State , the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees . #% While there appears to be some consensus emerging on decoupling , I have reservations about the long-term implications for a commercially focused EU agriculture . #% We hope that will not be the case and that the Police Service of Northern Ireland will bring a trial successfully to court , with the cooperation of those who have influence within communities in Northern Ireland . #% Essentially , we need to strike a balance between the health and safety of workers and the temptation to over-legislate -- to be too prescriptive -- and to override the principle of subsidiarity and attempt a ` one size fits all ' piece of legislation . #% In fact , in the United States , it produces less energy than wood , even having cost that much . #% The reason I put a specific request for you to come forward with conclusions or results at the end of the presidency in December is that I was hoping that - linking back to what Mr Hyland was talking about earlier - it would be possible during your time in the presidency to undertake a joint initiative between young people and the presidency to ask young people about the dangers facing them and try and alleviate some of the social problems and issues people face that drive them into the drug culture . #% A year ago , I spoke in Parliament in relation to this particular matter and my views were clearly laid out . #% When I met the leaders of the milk industry -- the representatives of the farmers who produce milk in Northern Ireland -- I was somewhat disturbed to find that the reduction by the European Union of the export refunds on milk powder , as well as other export refunds , has driven the price received by the farmers in my region to an all-time low . #% In Malta , Ireland is being used as an example of how you can be a Member of the European Union and a wonderful economic success and still remain neutral . #% Pig prices and sheep prices have collapsed . #% I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , for his hard work and the close contact he has maintained with both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission in an effort to find a way forward and - given the critical deadline of 1 April - to prevent a legislative vacuum from occurring . #% This is nonsense talk and it is nothing more than the Sudanese Government playing politics with people 's lives . #% Whatever penalty the courts will decide for these people I do not believe the death penalty is right . #% The European Union exists partly so that we can work together and give value and share our experiences . #% This has got to be acted upon , and acted upon positively , and the response should be made in a very responsible and effective manner . #% It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor . #% In July I called for a crusade for children ; now more than ever such a crusade is imperative . #% Regarding the Middle East , I would urge Minister Cowen , who is going there today , to raise the concerns of many Members of this Parliament . #% Mr President , I wish to compliment the President of the Court of Auditors on his report this morning and I want to raise one particular matter . #% It is basically criminalising victims , people who are seeking asylum and refuge . #% It is horrific that slavery and exploitation can take place on the European continent where we like to think of ourselves as socially enlightened . #% Concerns which have been raised , for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines , are being tackled . #% The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards . #% We want from you concrete objectives . #% Mr President , this resolution speaks of the gulf between the public and the European institutions . #% The Commission initially sought to introduce criminal sanctions , but faced with the Member States ' unanimous opposition to this approach , the Commission wisely decided to settle for a statement on the matter . #% My Group will therefore be supporting the resolution from the PPE-DE Group . #% It is imperative that the protection of the health of our citizens is our only priority and that all decisions will be based on the best scientific evidence available . #% In condemning the way the US is spending its foreign aid , Amendment 5 presumes a mandate that this House and this Union simply do not have . #% That resignation follows the damning report by the Committee of Independent Experts of the Commission as an administration that in too many instances was out of control and a system where too few people were prepared to accept personal accountability and responsibility for their conduct of public affairs . #% If the outcome of the IGC is to be ratified successfully it must also secure the consent of other institutions such as the European Parliament , the European Commission and members of national parliaments . #% Action has been taken in the past against one government -- the Irish Government -- because of its so-called failure to meet certain criteria under the broad economic policy guidelines . #% Specifically , what are the key strategic objectives for the European Union at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora -- CITES -- to be held in Bangkok , Thailand , from 2 to 14 October 2004 ? #% I totally refute what my colleague Mr De Rossa said here today . #% My Group has therefore taken the initiative of calling on the Commission to present an updated opinion on Malta 's renewed application , and , as Commissioner Van Den Broek has said , to see if and how they can catch up on the past two years while the application was frozen . #% Presenting us with your vision of the future is all very well , but actually making it work for the people of Europe is the real challenge . #% Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years . #% And please , tell us what your many benchmarking exercises have shown . #% National control of corporation tax has been a key weapon in the arsenal of many countries in fighting for international investment . #% PEACE focuses specifically on reconciliation and the projects it has funded have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations . #% That must not continue . #% They are going to be asked to pay for this so that the police can , without warrants and without any justification , bar this bland statement by yourself , say that this is done to fight crime . #% It is a human imperative , but also a deeply ingrained cultural imperative in Europe . #% The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority . #% The principal benefit of a single European currency for Ireland is the prospect of a lower trend in interest rates . #% That is why I voted against this budget . #% I am quite upset at the way the oral amendment was bounced . #% 
Completion of the internal market in electricity and gas is something which will impact on each and every one of the 370 million consumers right across the European Union . #% Let us do all in our power to stop the carnage on our roads . #% Despite the fact that some of those issues continue to create difficulties , I believe that some progress has been made . #% This directive can contribute to that . #% Labour Euro MPs do not believe that families should continue to bear the full cost of the UK 's budgetary contribution . #% We therefore call on the Council to withdraw its proposal and , as stated in the report , call on the Commission or the Council to make a declaration in plenary on a proposal for a new Europol decision , which shall be submitted six months following the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% It currently seems to be attempting to turn MAGP from a programme to reduce fishing fleet capacity by decommissioning , scrapping etc. , into a programme to limit the fishing efforts which the fleets are allowed to make . #% As well as that , from my own experience in Ireland , over the last 10 years the one key element with regard to the solution of conflict and of discrimination and of hatred , is dialogue . #% First of all , I would like a proper evaluation , as Mr Pérez Royo requested , an economic evaluation and a cost-benefit analysis on behalf of the Union . #% I think it is not a Parliament decision but a Commission decision . #% This is a work in progress and the Commission will present a report every three years on the implementation of the initiative . #% In exchange , they are obliged to adopt all EU legislation related to the single market except those pieces of legislation that relate to agriculture and fisheries . #% Of course , life is not like that and mothers often work outside the home . #% Mr President , I feel that none of us must lose sight of the fact that the European Union is seen as irrelevant and unresponsive to the crises in our world today . #% in writing . - I support this report because it gives an adequate budget framework for the important work of the EU institutions during this time of economic crisis for European citizens . #% The EU should be taking advantage of these benefits . #% The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States . #% What we must be careful of in the field of taxation is not taking into account the needs of certain Member States . #% In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984 , yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion . #% We can not demand in this institution , of other institutions , what we would not demand of ourselves . #% When Members States vote 10 to 5 against anti-dumping procedures , which they believe will not be in the interest of the industry , then you and the Commission must accept those decisions . #% We do not think that having one specific programme with one management will lead to transparency and adequate monitoring . #% I could have flown to America and back in the same time ! #% Mobility of researchers also tends to be high when there is a mix of such researchers . #% I realise it is difficult for colleagues from other Member States to realise how low farm incomes have fallen in my country , Ireland , mainly due to the fact that Ireland is heavily dependent on export markets , both in the EU and in third countries . #% In this regard I would urge him to exert some pressure on the Council to come to a final decision as to the location of the all-important Food Safety Authority . #% It is a difficult pill to swallow that having blatantly disregarded international management of the mackerel stock and , in 2010 , declared a catch of 100 000 tonnes , Iceland has the freedom to export its entire mackerel catch into the EU . #% Mr President , sorry for taking up your time but I just want to put on the record as a point of order my objection to the fact that on the agenda for this week we have Question Time to the Commission at 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon and at the same time we also have committee meetings . #% Therefore some people want to accept the advice of ICES only when it suits . #% Secondly , as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ? #% The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again . #% The International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objective of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact , dialogue and reconciliation between the Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland . #% Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector ? #% I support Mr Langen when he states that he is concerned to see that European farmers do not lose out as the new euro currency comes into play . #% Thank you very much for the invitation . #% In conclusion , in our anxiety to safeguard the consumer interest - our main objective - we must also ensure that agriculture is allowed to benefit from the advances in modern technology . #% After this incident alone , how can any reasonable person believe for one moment anything that is written in a press release by BNFL ? #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , President-designate of the Commission and nominee Commissioners , you are very welcome to our Chamber this afternoon and we look forward to our hearings and our various communications over the next few weeks and eventually months and years . #% But really it is contradictory for the Council on the one hand to be talking about initiatives to create employment and then to go ahead with a policy which will create unemployment to the tune of 140 , 000 job losses . #% Hiring one 's dentist to do work of dubious , if any , European value is not acceptable . #% There is no doubt that the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive needs updating after 15 years in force . #% The European Union is economically strong , but there are still key social problems in many rural and urban areas . #% This is very serious and yet the Irish Government is not setting up an independent enquiry . #% However , the increased over-representation of women in ` non-standard ' employment is extremely worrying and I would like to repeat the report 's calls on the Commission to encourage Member States to ` exchange best practices and make full use of the cofinancing opportunities offered by the Structural Funds ... to ensure broader access to affordable , quality childcare and elderly care facilities so that women are not forced to undertake these duties on an informal basis ' . #% How can you deliver a common fisheries policy if some governments avail of options and some do not ? #% What has the effect of liberalisation and privatisation been on those who are marginalised ? #% You have to build consensus here or you fail . #% The Irish presidency is also letting down the Irish public , which views this matter as an absolute scandal . #% EU Enlargement is a win-win situation for the European Union and for the people of the applicant states . #% As the past months have shown , the importance of energy security has never been as acute . #% I trust this Parliament will continue to condemn those who fail to share our commitment to fundamental freedoms . #% Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention , thus sustainability . #% Yet the value of these items is small and court redress would be costly and nonsensical . #% The privilege we have in Ireland should be extended to all Member States . #% Under the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty , the interim agreement between the European Union and the USA , signed in November 2009 , required the consent of the European Parliament . #% There are certainly many people who believe that qualified majority voting and codecision procedures should be used to tackle immigration issues . #% Indeed , the President , Mr Barroso , said : ` nobody has a monopoly on truth ' -- and that includes the Portuguese Government and ` Women on Waves ' . #% I respect the point you make , that this was discussed by the Conference of Presidents last week and given the situation at that time it was decided not to place it on the agenda this week . #% The costs involved are very real , with direct implications for jobs , consumers and electricity generation . #% From an EU perspective and in the context of the application of the principle of subsidiarity we can not ignore the potential and desire of our citizens to participate in the work of nation-building . #% I would like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of my group and on behalf of Parliament for the tremendous work that they have done on their joint reports . #% The compromise proposed by the Irish presidency completely ignores the will of Parliament . #% It is not often that I agree fully with my Northern Ireland colleague , Mr Paisley . #% Instead of tattooing them , the modern-day Europe is going to identify those who make us feel uncomfortable by fingerprinting . #% Some of us think that nuclear energy is expensive , outdated , potentially dangerous and no solution at all to energy problems . #% Regrettably the reason is patently obvious : commercial interests are dictating the policy towards China in both the United States and many European Member States . #% 
It is not so long ago that the outgoing presidency refused to come to this Parliament to report on its activities because it wanted to go immediately afterwards . #% The provision of and access to such services is the essence of what sustainable rural development is all about . #% I do not think it is all simply down to enterprise . #% Despite the risks and the dangers which new advances and new technologies present , they also offer us a wonderful new opportunity to correct some of the errors of the past , to be more socially cohesive within Europe . #% I call on the Commission , through the Seventh Framework Programme , to provide financial support for the further development of blood-based tests , to provide funding for comprehensive investigation into the causes of breast cancer , to urge Member States to set up information and counselling centres , whilst simultaneously reporting back to the European Parliament on the results of more recent research conducted in this very important area . #% I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector , the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion , which is a considerable proportion of the budget . #% The normal term of design protection under the directive is 25 years . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom as President-in-Office of the Council to Parliament this morning . #% There is clear and unequivocal scientific evidence that demonstrates the effect of climate change . #% It is up to any Member State in response to the proposal to make whatever proposals it considers would be helpful in all the circumstances . #% In December 2000 European Union leaders agreed a set of Treaty reforms in Nice which they considered would be the best procedure for bringing about enlargement . #% Madame , I know , I was there ! #% There is considerable international ignorance about family law and what happens in the event of marital breakdown and children being taken back to a country where they do not normally live . #% After all , the European agricultural model is supposed to be about their survival . #% There is general agreement on this . #% Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges . #% ` Unilateral trade disarmament ' is unacceptable . #% The European Union puts huge resources and effort into keeping out so-called illegal immigrants , yet it can not stop the illegal import of trophies . #% We regret that we were unable to change the whole pro-incineration approach to a pro-recycling approach . #% Mr President , I welcome the Galeote report . #% In conclusion , I have one comment on the overall fifth framework programme . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to undertake to look into this matter of the Scotch-Irish language and see to it that the principle of equality be implemented with regard to this language , along with all the other languages of the European Union , so that they can all stand on a level playing field . #% There is also the option of strengthening the controls of the European Union borders with Eastern Europe and finally , we should consider the formulation of various partnership agreements with the Eastern European States to deal with this issue . #% The principle of subsidiarity in relation to water pricing policy is jealously guarded in Ireland , but public opinion will probably change by 2010 . #% If nuclear safety and nuclear energy are so safe , why are not the majority of these installations located near the population centres of the south-east of England ? #% My last point is that we should not rush towards achieving all these goals in the short term . #% What a scandal this is , considering that USD 300 billion have been obscenely wasted on weapons of mass destruction and war and lost in corruption over that time . #% So , in the context of the directive on free movement and practice of the professions , we hope there will be improvements here . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner - assuming that he can verify that - if he has the power to prosecute the people in question for this declared and confessed discrimination . #% Emergency aid in the short term must be backed up with longer-term aid to help the future generations recover from this most horrific ordeal . #% I want to assure the honourable Member that the presidency will do everything it can to advance the sympathies expressed in his question . #% We attach considerable importance to the successful introduction of the euro . #% It has become more necessary now to reassure , act and deliver on the enlargement agenda . #% Finally , I want to make the point that this issue is not the same as the issue of violence between strangers . #% Madam President , Commissioner , I welcome the fact that the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines have been engaged in building a peace process . #% We must get it right and I am confident that we can . #% So it is felt that the European Union has failed to bring about a single market in the whole area of insurance . #% Those parties who supported Nice should seek a mandate at the next general election , which will take place by June 2002 , to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002 . #% This would , I believe , be the remit of the Commission and I would expect that to be the intention . #% in writing . - Many recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence and this is , in part , borne from proper laws to protect consumers in the marketplace . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner Špidla . #% Children are naturally concerned about their environment . #% It is also vitally important that the market be stabilised with the continued availability of intervention , whenever that is necessary and until such times as balance is restored to the market , and that imports and production be reduced . #% The Council today needs to explain why politically it has scandalously disregarded this capacity for an appropriate flanking measure , because symbolically it is saying to the 18 million unemployed : we frankly do not care about the appropriate mix , we are monetarists and we will do it our way . #% Our real goal must be to plan and give our support to the successful implementation of these funds to improve the life prospects of people in our poorest regions . #% This is important . #% The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access , or the reduction of import tariffs . #% It has also been a slap in the face to this House and those of us Members who have since 20 March tried in every way possible to resolve the problem and reduce the adverse impact of the BSE crisis . #% These proposals could have a serious effect on tourist earnings from angling , and also have a negative cultural impact on many parts of Ireland . #% It is vital that these successes are now accompanied by further measures which strengthen democratic control , protect the rights of consumers and fully inform ordinary people about the changeover to the single currency so that the prophets of doom will not be proved right . #% We also have to look at the fact that in any kind of future measures against Iraq we should focus on the enhancement of human rights and democracy , and we should also look at the protection of the Kurds and in the north and the Shi'ites in the south in terms of guaranteeing them some sort of autonomy . #% We have a responsibility to do our best to ensure , first of all , that all criteria are met , but also to do what is in our power to ensure that the Globalisation Fund ensures added value . #% Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place . #% There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research . #% While I am appreciative of the work undertaken by these different departments and their different mandates , increasing the levels of cooperation and coherence could greatly enhance the protection afforded by Natura 2000 sites . #% For certain programmes the backlog of outstanding commitments is equivalent to more than eight-and-a-half years of payments . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report . #% This is a modern state-of-the-art multi-million plant . #% I thank the Minister for his consideration in undertaking to reply to the questions in writing . #% Is it because the Commission realises that if GM agriculture goes ahead it will destroy organic farming unless we redefine ` organic ' ? #% Madam President , we make this subject sound very complicated but for me it boils down to two questions : how much fish can we take , and who can take them ? #% Mr President , the President-in-Office of the Council may find it strange that I should be welcoming the Irish Republic 's presidency today , but I know that he will understand my intention because he is going to be so busy over the next six months that we will not have to tolerate his presence at meetings in Northern Ireland . #% Action must be taken against the continued practice of female genital mutilation . #% There are some encouraging signs that this may happen . #% Having listened to the extent of plans that the Commission has in relation to animal welfare , I can only wish that they had similar plans in relation to the welfare of children . #% Once again , we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum . #% 
It is claimed by Sinn Féin that the murder of Robert McCartney was not politically motivated . #% Mr President , unfortunately , the EU learnt little from the Erika disaster , when 13 000 tonnes of oil spilled off the coast of Brittany . #% Mr President , I had hoped that the extra time taken by the Commission to fine-tune the proposals would have resulted in documents which would fully reflect the concerns raised by this House when we adopted our opinion earlier this year . #% Why are we not , for instance , opening up discussions and debate with Iran at the present time ? #% As regards your role , we hope , above all , that you may contribute to closing the gap between the aspirations and reality of European foreign policy . #% However , the timetable for possible accession lies in Turkish hands alone . #% The Commission should now work with the new Member States and accession countries to assist them in using the European Regional Development Fund and the pre-accession funds to create a comprehensive health care infrastructure . #% This is a direct result of the unforgivable spamming of our system by a certain Dr Rath of Germany , who appears to have considerable interests in the matter of vitamin therapy on which we are voting this morning . #% We want to exercise our right . #% Ireland 's per capita carbon emission is 17.5 tonnes per annum . #% Energy efficiency is an important priority . #% It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem . #% The few words I have said about Martin O'Hagan are entirely inadequate to convey the shock and the horror that people of all political and religious persuasions in Ireland feel at this horrible deed . #% It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed . #% What does it really mean ? #% The present system whereby the Commission operates the CAP on a day-to-day basis subject to the overall supervision of the Council of Ministers has been satisfactory and should be maintained . #% Such decisions are best left to national courts and national judges who have a wealth of experience in dealing with such cases . #% I do not believe we have . #% In this context I welcome today 's report by Marianne Thyssen MEP . #% Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environment Action Programme would not be attained easily , the Commission has rightly decided on a step by step approach setting out so - called interim environmental targets by the year 2010 . #% I nevertheless welcome the increase on the common position of EUR 300 million . #% We are now faced with what appears to be a sudden problem on account of the large population . #% The budget in these fields is going to increase next year and in the 2007 -- 2013 financial perspective . #% No part of this Community has a traceable system like the system in Northern Ireland . #% The issue of most widespread concern at the present time is crime . #% - The EUR 45 million to the IFI is most welcome , and a continuing recognition of the European Union 's support for the cross-border communities in Ireland . #% By facilitating at long last the formation of European cooperatives and guaranteeing the involvement of workers at board level in such new enterprises we will be sending a positive message to the cooperative movement . #% In the ten years that I have been an MEP I have never encountered such a personal , aggressive and abusive campaign as I have with this particular directive . #% Mr President , I wish to speak in a personal capacity on a point of order because I have been traduced here tonight by the rapporteur , Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca . #% I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue . #% Mr President , I would like to join with you and the people of Spain in welcoming the good news you have received . #% I made a proposal in my speech which was not recorded because I had not realized that the Vice-President had asked for silence and I went on speaking . #% The genocide that is taking place in Chechnya seems to be ignored by the Western powers and certainly by the European Parliament . #% What is the Council 's response to the statement by President Bush that the USA has decided not to implement the Kyoto Protocol ? #% Thus this is a directive which I can not , and will not , support . #% Whole communities in our countries are being destroyed because of widespread unemployment . #% Mr President , this period is an important opportunity for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples . #% It is true that , owing to innovation and evolution , many of today 's products offer the consumer more choice and flexibility , but many are difficult for consumers to understand : 56 % of consumers in the UK did not understand the terms used in credit agreements , 77 % find the language in advertising confusing and while 68 % are aware that lenders do not calculate APR in the same way , they do not know how the system works and find it difficult to price one loan against another , which makes it difficult for them to shop around for the best deals . #% The levels of violence and the levels of provocation have risen to new heights , and this is the primary reason why the parties are now no longer engaged in dialogue . #% It is quite absurd to have two separate Treaties dealing with something as fundamental and complicated as energy . #% Ireland is currently 25 % in excess of its targets and yet , a couple of months ago , the then Minister of Finance announced that he was abandoning a commitment to introduce a carbon tax . #% Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote . #% Mr President , my Group very much welcomes this report . #% The European PVC industry has signed a voluntary commitment concerning the sustainable development of PVC and this programme is to be implemented this year . #% That is one of Ireland 's and , I suspect , many countries ' cardinal sins in relation to the area we are discussing . #% If we go down the route of denying basic human rights and basic democratic rights to those we suspect of terror , then we are giving them a victory and we are shaping a society which in the long run will not be in the best interests of the people of this world who want to live in a sustainable peace . #% While in many ways we welcome the progress that the introduction of this particular vessel brings and we welcome modern technology , in a situation where fishermen can not find sufficient stocks in order to justify the capacity that was already there , it seems strange to introduce a new vessel which may be licensed and accepted and which could catch half or perhaps two-thirds of the entire Irish quota . #% I have known him for a long time and I am absolutely certain that he means what he says in this particular report . #% I welcome the proposal to introduce a Community-wide classification of hotel facilities and the promotion at EU level of voluntary standards concerning measures to improve safety aspects in hotels and tourist services in general . #% Mr President , I would like to address one particular aspect of the draft general budget for 2004 in so far as it relates to the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , of which I am a member . #% Mr President , in 2002 this Parliament agreed a resolution not to pursue scientific and technical cooperation with Israel because of the violent and shocking situation in the Middle East at the time . #% Let us not forget our achievements and goals in Bali . #% Mr Ó Neachtain 's report in committee was very good , but , unfortunately , it was voted down by a few votes because Spanish Members voted for their own interests - just like the Irish . #% One of the things we should try and do over the next five years is to forge a closer partnership between national and regional parliaments and the European level . #% I am fairly sceptical about allowing the regulators to do that through the Florence work . #% Iraq deserves better than the Commission reply . #% I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission ' s strategy on cybercrime . #% It is essential therefore that the EU have a strict arms code policy that equates with EU values if we are to offer global leadership on this issue . #% The Commission 's own group of advisers on the ethical implications of biotechnology , Opinion No 8 , paragraph 2 : ' An invention based on the use of elements of human origin having been retrieved without respecting the principle of consent will not fulfil the ethical requirements . #% I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium . #% I wonder why it has not already been circulated to Members , as I believe it has already been circulated to the industry ? #% Why is it not possible to do a proper study based on the realities we face today ? #% But if you ask an anthropologist or anyone involved in any of the sciences , this was highlighted 15 years ago as an issue to be dealt with by 2015 . #% in writing . - I welcome the Commission 's Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU . #% A new method has to be found which leads to results that are understood and accepted by all of us , involving national and regional parliaments and , indeed , civil society . #% 
Fewer people want to become seafarers . #% in writing . - The EU budget post-2013 must be fit for purpose to maintain competitiveness , to increase economic growth and to combat high unemployment in Europe . #% There is no excuse for us ; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from . #% In this context , I pay tribute to the Irish Government for a whole series of actions it has taken in this sector . #% In relation to priorities , there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people . #% This legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision-making processes of the European Parliament . #% Uzbekistan is a large and very influential country in Central Asia . #% Nevertheless , the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry should never compromise or put at risk the health of human beings . #% For example , in Ireland , out of 48 000 cattle tested there has not been one reactor to the BSE test , and to me that is an indication that the disease is confined to other animals in the suckler cow and dairy herds . #% It is counterproductive and it has made a bad situation very much worse . #% It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for . #% That involves a massive surrender of national power , compounded in its folly by the lack of real control over what the Commission then does in our name . #% They now seem to specialize in putting new obstacles in the way and of course the latest one is meeting the EMU convergence criteria . #% This is more than a missed opportunity . #% The Commission states that there was a more recent assessment by Spanish scientists . #% However , in reality , unless they are working in parallel and in coordination with each other , maximum results will not be achieved , i.e. maximum economic growth and development and maximum employment of those ideals . #% One only has to look at Ireland 's interest in the rural environmental protection scheme and the number of farmers participating in that scheme to see how positively we in Ireland are committed to a natural environment . #% Certainly , from an Irish perspective , Irish people recognise the importance of the Commission as an institutional body within the European Union . #% The Commissioner may be aware that for the last two years the Irish Sea has been closed at spawning time to aid stock recovery . #% I welcome our political support in this regard but any future actions which are taken on this issue must be strictly dealt with under the auspices of specific United Nations mandates . #% I call on this House and the Justice Commissioner to speak out against this wretched legislation . #% In addition the Commission has produced a new programme to compensate farmers for some of their losses . #% Yet , within two years , Commissioner Mandelson seems to be prepared to sacrifice the European model of agriculture in order to hammer out a deal at the WTO , by forcing farmers to bear a disproportionate share of the burden . #% The criminal fraternity throughout the European Union has enormous resources - resources unimaginable even to the European Union budget . #% Both sides must respect international humanitarian law and protect and assist the civilian population in the combat zone , as well as in the safe zone . #% I support the continuation of each Member State of the Union having the right to appoint a nominee as a full voting member of the European Commission . #% Mr President , first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation . #% We consider it appropriate that this progress be encouraged further and assisted through closer contractual relations with the European Union . #% I would end by saying to the President-in-Office that the jury is out , the ball is in his court and that he has all our support . #% I appeal for mercy and assurance that she will not be executed under any circumstance . #% Unlike Mr van Velzen , I support very strongly the rapporteur ' s amendment raising the percentage of savings to 1.5 % above what would happen anyway . #% With regard to specific events of recent weeks , I believe that any mention of financially reprimanding Ireland , which is being suggested in some quarters , would be a highly regressive step . #% We are now into to the third or fourth programme . #% We must vote against this amendment . #% That is why the Commission must take some sort of initiative to bring in legislation to ensure that this issue is wiped out . #% Having had the privilege to visit India on a number of occasions , I have been deeply impressed by the rate of economic development there over recent years and particularly in key 21st century industries such as information technology . #% I would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now . #% It is extremely important that the European Union is perceived by our citizens as more than an economic exercise and a free market because that , without any doubt , will alienate them further from the notion of European integration . #% Another key issue is the Lisbon process . #% This outcome created great uncertainty for a number of reasons . #% If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future . #% Also , the added value will come from the fact that the EGF will not replace actions that are the responsibility of companies , but are a valuable addition to measures taken at national level . #% What Mrs Nicole Pery reported to the Bureau was quite simply that she had various documents from different groups and individuals and many varied suggestions on this particular matter . #% The proposed European Commission directive to increase competition in port services in the EU threatens to reverse this . #% I come from the country where this experiment took place . #% We all know what our responsibilities are when it comes to the issue of combating AIDS and we must act accordingly . #% I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands . #% I would like to know , in the time that you have left , would the Council be prepared to look at ways in which this particular deadline could be avoided and examine possible alternative policies to compensate for any negative impact in the regional area and the tourism area . #% Parliament has insisted on targets for re-use and recycling of waste . #% After that there will eventually be a second referendum . #% This matter was signalled clearly at the Conference of Presidents last week - on more than one occasion , I understand . #% It is very clear that the problem of illegal immigration in Europe is one that needs to be tackled and I welcome the agreement reached by our leaders to intensify their coordinating efforts at sea and land borders to halt illegal immigration into the Union . #% Many Member States welcomed refugees from Chile . #% Europe must not be allowed to export its excess capacity . #% As we speak the Tánaiste Mr Spring is meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in Dublin . #% The response from European citizens and their record generosity and solidarity have been immense . #% I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament 's report , specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters . #% Nuclear waste should never be transported through densely populated areas . #% We would all like to see certain outcomes from elections because of our own political beliefs , but some of us have to temper our language and our thoughts because of the positions we hold . #% We had , unfortunately , a terribly long delay with regard to the agreement for the funding on the TENs . #% The present difficulties experienced by farmers are serious . #% This would give tremendous EU added value to our work in trying to promote renewable energy . #% This convention aims to provide legal recognition for domestic work as work , to extend rights to all domestic workers , and to prevent violations and abuses . #% I say this because the safety of nuclear plants in Eastern and Central Europe has been a cause for great concern in recent years , and will continue to be . #% As I have done on so many occasions in the past , I repeat my call that in order to ensure an appropriate policy of decentralisation it is essential to maintain access to the territorial waters of 12 miles as the exclusive sovereign preserve of the coastal States and to extend this preserve to 24 miles , as previously agreed by this House in February 1999 . #% The function of such a study must be to clarify the basic principles for the EU - the logistics of implementing that policy can come later . #% 
When you look down through the list of issues and areas that need to be covered , of course there are always difficulties that will arise , whether it is with regard to long-term unemployment , youth unemployment , female unemployment , social welfare provision , protection with regard to access to housing , access to education and training , or more recently the demographic situation and the pensions crisis that is looming before us . #% The inclusion of undesirable ingredients by feed manufacturers in animal feed was responsible for BSE and the Dioxin scare . #% You know that the European Parliament has , over the past twenty years , given every political and financial support to encourage peace in Northern Ireland . #% One of the things which concerns me very much is the fact that when we have had phenomenal growth rates , these have not converted into employment . #% EU leaders in Portugal last year laid down a framework of proposals whereby training in the use of the Internet would be extended to all primary and secondary schools across the European Union . #% I welcome the recent decision on fining Greece and I would like to see the same thing happen with the Irish government if they fail to comply with directives . #% I will send the details of these cases individually to the Presidency . #% . I wish to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , for their presentations . #% The system would enable citizens of the Community and others to have prompt and easy access to authoritative and up-to-date information in relation to the existence and progress of trans-border litigation in which they may have a legitimate interest . #% The impact assessment adopted earlier by the Commission shows that Ireland is one of countries particularly vulnerable to price reductions for sugar and sugar beet . #% Rather than criticising or pointing the finger and saying that this tragedy was more dramatic , more damaging or more influential in European politics than others , let us agree that it happened and use it as an example . #% The fact is that uniformity is not necessarily unification . #% Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate . #% I broadly welcome the Jové Peres report in its present form . #% There is a need for the European institutions to act coherently and to give the 120 million children living in the European Union the protection they deserve and have a right to expect , which is full recognition of children as citizens of the European Union and nothing less . #% They need our help . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this important report . #% Equally I have no difficulty in endorsing - and indeed emphasizing - the need for effective cooperation to combat drug gangs whose members , if they care in any way , have so many deaths and ruined lives on their hands . #% I might add that threshold is one we would never have crossed if we had followed the soft advice of a false sense of confidence commended by some to this House last December . #% It is completely unacceptable to let EU vessels continue fishing undisturbed regardless of the fact that there is a conflict there . #% Firstly , I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy for their cooperation in producing this report . #% Madam President , the twin bodies of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman form a key plank in bringing the European Union closer to its people . #% I jest not . #% Madam President , firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , Leo Tindemans . #% In the resolution , reference is made to two very old Buddhist monks who spent two decades in detention under house arrest for their peaceful support for human rights , democracy and religious freedom . #% The full cooperation of Member States is needed if the European Union is to play its full part in reducing the level of greenhouse emissions . #% We must get rid of these excessively long journeys , particularly where animals are being transported to places as far away as the Middle East . #% In relation to the working time directive on road transport operators , I have concerns about the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition of mobile workers . #% You said here today that you intend to have more team work . #% Poverty inevitably outweighs concerns about conservation and makes enforcement measures seem unjustified and hard to implement where people depend on bushmeat to survive . #% But we should not offer the prospect of young , energetic people in greater numbers producing the quantity of food that Europe needs today because they will not eat it . #% The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities . #% However , as Ireland levies VRT , it is a draconian tax that has no rationale except to bleed Irish car owners of money -- a lot of money from citizens who , for the most part , do not have a public transport system that will allow them to manage without a car . #% I welcome the fact that the directive as proposed was improved , but it is still not good enough and I hope that it will not destroy the software industry in Europe as we know it . #% Provisions relating to the equine passport were modified through Decision 2000/68 but it subsequently ran into legal problems . #% There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders . #% In conclusion , harmonisation is needed and welcomed to the extent that it respects the different range of financial products and the cultural differences in financial services in each Member State . #% Madam President , Hamas is evil : it is responsible for some of the most vile terrorist attacks ever witnessed . #% I therefore call for a linkage between ongoing EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights and the negotiations on trade . #% We have to bear in mind all the time that resources are finite and that we must improve life for everyone in the Community . #% I agree with the rapporteur 's comments when he introduced his report that voluntary codes of conduct and binding agreements are not necessarily mutually exclusive . #% I recall Commissioner Bjerregaard saying at the press conference at the end that we would have wanted to achieve more , that we always do , but that this was as much as we could persuade the other parties to the conference to agree to . #% I also support , of course , the IDABC Programme as outlined by Mrs Read . #% Electrical or electronic switch gear , amongst other vital uses , will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment . #% This is also the mindset which makes our Environmental Protection Agency a rubber stamp of approval for even the dirtiest business , no matter how damaging it is to the environment ; a mindset that opens Ireland to toxic industries like incineration , which Irish people do not want . #% Mr President , it is good that we are doing something to assist the poultry industry . #% I am a strong supporter of the establishment of an EU defence policy because I believe it is as much a fundamental part of European integration as the single currency . #% These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings . #% I really think we need to know where we are going . #% Everyone wants rural development , but in the context of beleaguered Irish farming , the only rural development I welcome is one that supports family farming , while enriching rural communities with complementary social , educational , transport and employment projects and infrastructure . #% The amount of money given has been a decreasing portion of farmer spending over the past number of years . #% That is not happening . #% I had expected my colleague , Mr Florenz , to be leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but I do not see him . #% Mr President , I too acknowledge the presence of the President-in-Office and I want to thank the Commissioner for his openness and willingness to engage in continuing debate on the future of European agriculture . #% The Cairo conference term ` reproductive health ' was defined by the World Health Organisation as including the term ` fertility regulation ' which includes the term ` interrupting unwanted pregnancy ' , i.e. abortion . #% Madam President , as you were informed earlier this week , I was in Scotland protesting against the Trident nuclear submarine base there and I was arrested . #% These issues need debating and both consumers and public are right to be cautious . #% In conclusion , I would urge the Commission to ensure that as quickly as possible we have a short-term resolution to the crisis for minor food-producing species in relation to the availability of state-of-art veterinary medicines . #% But of this I am certain : society will not tolerate , and must be protected from , any intrusion , deliberate or otherwise , that reduces the dignity and the sanctity of each human being to an object of scientific manipulation . #% I am satisfied that it does not interfere with Member States competences in the following domains : #% Mr President , there are currently over 40 million people in the world who are suffering from AIDS . #% We have a duty and an obligation to treat everyone in this world equally . #% This is not in any individual country ; it is everywhere . #% Along with my colleagues , I will support the measures looking for increased funding to be made available . #% There are serious challenges facing the European Union in the field of justice and home affairs . #% We wish him well and we want to see him succeed . #% 
As far as I can tell there is no plan to do anything at all and that is disgraceful . #% In the internal market procedure , why should there be a difference ? #% I am strongly in favour of a greater regionalisation of the common fisheries policy through the creation of a comprehensive series of regional management units and regional advisory committees based on the use of ICES areas and sub-areas to define the boundary lines . #% I fully support the Council proposal to delegate the implementation of 80-85 % of the budget to national agencies and so I have voted against this Report . #% There is an urgent need for a third-party monitoring system to be appointed in an effort firstly to end the violence which is taking place now on a daily basis , and secondly to resume peace talks . #% This European Food Authority can work with the 15 governments of the Union , in an advisory and preventative capacity , to guarantee that food products from farm to table comply with the highest public health standards . #% The real winners would be the beef barons of South America , if we were to allow Irish farmers to be sold out . #% It is vital that the governments now support the EP 's recommendations in the EU Social Affairs Council on 2 December . #% The conclusions of the Tampere Council meeting present a strong political message , reaffirming the Union 's wish to overcome difficulties in prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime while protecting the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators . #% However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this . #% It is a matter which is coming to the fore more and more , particularly now that the Cold War is over and the dust is settling . #% This report goes into a lot of detail about what a new human rights clause could or should look like , how it could be monitored and enforced to make it more effective and what the consequences of breaching the clause might be in different cases . #% We either all comply with the rules or we do not . #% We are very concerned about the reports we have received in relation to imprisonment of religious leaders of the United Buddhist Church , despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom . #% Let us not exclude them for the rare blood groups and for the very scarce plasma and plasma products if they are needed to pay to ensure adequacy of supply . #% The important role that the Petitions Committee plays is of course at the other side of that equation , where we seek to ensure that national governments and local authorities comply with European law in the interests of the citizen . #% I welcome the idea of a mid-term review for early next year and I look forward to participating in it . #% I should like to point out to him that unfortunately I am not the master of whether I get the opportunity to put a question to him , or any other minister in this House , during the course of the debates - it is the group which decides who takes the floor . #% I accept that we ought not to increase prices indefinitely and we should relate it to area aid or the number of people on the land who protect the environment and maintain the rural fabric . #% Preparing for enlargement is not going to be a particularly easy task and it will not be made any easier if Parliament and the Commission are not working closely together to guarantee that tough decisions must be taken on these issues or worked through in an atmosphere of understanding and equal purpose . #% This Parliament and the European institutions need no explanation about the importance of stability for mediumterm policy . #% We all know the figures and the scale of the humanitarian consequences of insufficient action by the international community . #% The Union can not hide from the naked fact that the EU itself , together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later . #% On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 . #% From the Irish perspective , we will have more confidence in the British regulatory authorities if they reject this application in its totality . #% The events are straightforward : following an initiative from a Spanish judge , General Pinochet was arrested in the United Kingdom under an international extradition warrant ; he has no diplomatic immunity in that country ; the Spanish Government has 40 days in which to respond . #% So either you give the floor to Mr Alavanos , or I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question . #% We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens . #% You also seem to believe that the mental health and suicide problem , which grows with our economic success , is a mere inconvenience and not a tragedy that our country has never really addressed . #% Most Member States are uneasy about the approach being taken by the scientific sub-groups and would prefer a more open and transparent system of classification as set out in the OIE code which is recognised and accepted by countries worldwide . #% Notwithstanding the fact that Britain will not be joining a single European currency at the first stage the benefits of economic and monetary union for Ireland far outweigh any negatives . #% So before this House and the EU parade their human rights credentials , I say : let it set about righting that wrong , implementing the directive on employment in its entirety and ending the outrageous discrimination against the majority community in my country . #% We will judge our final vote in the light of which amendments carry . #% Will the President-in-Office take steps to ensure that it is not absorbed into national or regional statutory structures but is seen by those agencies as an important but independent development programme ? #% If Western European nuclear enterprises want to take their expertise around the world that is a matter for them , not for the European Union to support . #% I must say that it is somewhat disappointing that some of the amendments to this report are seeking to look for exemptions for areas under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) in my view seeking to secure Objective 1 status by the back door . #% The European Union and all the world 's major countries should come together to create that kind of world and to take the necessary steps to prevent war . #% I believe that the creation of an integrated framework and tighter coordination in the field of social security is an important part of our progress towards achieving the social dimension and social protection incorporated in the Lisbon process . #% But this is unrealistic . #% Many of the animals exported live are unsuited to our carcase beef industry and it is to the credit of the Irish Government that we have put in place state-of-the-art facilities for shipment of cattle to third countries . #% The Commission proposal to allow up to 5 % vegetable fat in the manufacture of chocolate is acceptable , as is the decision of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection to allow the listing of vegetable fats with other ingredients . #% There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas . #% There is a phrase often used in Northern Ireland politics : ` We all jump together ' . #% I appeal to the Commissioner to give us a more favourable response this evening , because the vote tomorrow will go in favour of the study , and it is time for the Commission to face up to that . #% I therefore welcome this proposal to establish a fisheries control agency . #% Finally , the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has been a very successful one . #% The cross-referencing of witness statements and Eurocontrol records has established that some EU states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean . #% I firmly believe that the benefits of the information society must be spread to both urban and rural areas and to all regions within the Union . #% Already scientists inform us that the last decade was the warmest on record and that 2007 was one of the top 10 warmest years . #% I sincerely hope that the very helpful set of amendments proposed by the rapporteur on behalf of the committee will be taken on board . #% Sellafield is expanding and preparing to take more and more radioactive waste for reprocessing . #% Others might give it another name , but it gets us to where we want to be at this point . #% Finally , I do not think it is appropriate that the third sector should be included . #% We need a clear commitment today from your presidency that before the end of December you will have put the necessary proposal on the inclusion of a special chapter on the rights of children and adolescents in the Treaty to the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Military dictatorship continues to rule by force , despite recent ceasefire talks and agreements . #% Mr President , I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to take another look at the situation with regard to the sugar regime in the European Union . #% You have all of us behind you and you have the tools to ensure that you can act both legally and effectively . #% The biotech industry in Europe alleges that GM farming is inevitable . #% I have just left the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , where I made the point that we were proceeding with indecent haste in relation to meeting those deadlines . #% We will be voting in favour but , nonetheless , we will do so with reservations on many of the paragraphs and recommendations . #% It is nothing short of scandalous that the Europol Convention is not ratified . #% Hopefully , very soon , we will be able to return to a more stable market . #% Therefore , we have voted in favour of the report as a whole . #% I will use my position as chair of the JPC to prevail upon the Icelandic people not to take up entrenched positions until such time as they know exactly what the deal is later on this year . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for bringing forward a report that not only looks at the problem but puts forward new ideas for the future . #% One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned . #% 
Throughout the EU and North America recent years have seen dramatic reversals in the pollution of air and water due to technological improvements driven by legislation and societal expectations . #% The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo and elsewhere led to sudden large population movements and the need for temporary protection . #% It is very important that Mrs Müller 's request be voted on by the House . #% Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere . #% What we are looking for is more consultation , more interaction . #% I do not know whether an air strike can take out all these weapons , but for us to start again without finishing would be disastrous . #% There are a lot of data available , supplied by farmers in meeting the requirements of various programmes and schemes , available to national and European authorities . #% It also seeks plans to develop methodological guidelines and undertake new data collection efforts to obtain comparable statistical data on gender-based violence in order to identify the extent of the problem and to provide a basis for a change in action towards the problem . #% Patient health and safety must be paramount , but it must not be an excuse to block the free movement of professionals . #% With regard to the phase-out dates proposed by various Members , our aim should be for this legislation to enter into force as soon as possible , so that industry can begin to get rid of the gases with very high global warming potential , while maintaining the six-year type-approval timeframe . #% We are so upset we were not included . #% Mr President , Tunisia is a country that has an important relationship with the European Union . #% We are all behind that fight , but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon . #% We should recall for a moment that the key findings of this fact-finding committee include the following recommendations : the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority should reaffirm existing agreements and immediately cease violence ; there should be a resumption of security cooperation ; there should be establishment of a meaningful cooling-off period and incitement in all forms should be discouraged . #% We need the contribution of these people whose livelihoods are at stake . #% Please answer me , but do not tell me that as President-in-Office you had no option but to negotiate on behalf of the EU . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs . #% I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said . #% So it goes without saying that BSE has been a disaster for Ireland . #% Finally I believe that this report had the broad support of the political groups within Parliament 's Committee on Transport . #% But I have a problem when we impose from on high purist-type ideas on those who can not defend themselves . #% Improved security is not a cheap exercise and one of the issues that has to be addressed at the conciliation stage is agreeing exactly who is going to foot the bill for the implementation of the new anti-terrorist security arrangements . #% The partnership approach involving all European governments and all the institutions in order to develop and formulate key EU policies must always be preserved . #% Obviously there are problems within our lawmaking process ; there are difficulties which we can all recognise and see in our everyday working lives . #% Without the EU 's efforts , I do not think the Summit would have made as much progress . #% I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your work and , above all , thanks to my colleague Mr Bowis for his excellent report . #% You need reliability and no discrimination ; you need help , particularly at domestic level , for energy efficiency measures ; and you need strong emphasis on public service obligations . #% These are all key and important elements , but the first thing that we have to overcome , the first barrier that has to be jumped is a psychological barrier and the prejudices within each and every one of us . #% The work programme submitted by the presidency suggests that efforts will also be made over the next six months to make progress in the negotiations on the reform of the common agricultural policy . #% This Directive now calls on Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services , including environmental and resource costs , in accordance with the polluter-pays principle . #% How can a one-size-fits-all directive , like the Nitrates Directive , work efficiently in these circumstances ? #% I come from a country that has a very bad record as regards obligations under EU environmental law . #% The report focuses all its attention on the juvenile problem , but these discards have wider consequences . #% Maybe he did not think I was worth coming to see ; I do not know . #% There were many reasons for this , but an overriding one was that our government took its citizens for granted . #% I was quite impressed by the Commissioner 's speech in which he identified the need for reform of our international law in relation to how , when and who should intervene in other states . #% This will be the job of Commissioner Wallström , who will have a key role in explaining how Europe takes its decisions and why Europe makes these decisions . #% The resolution also tries to deal with the more sensitive issue of involvement by Western , and specifically US and European , technology and companies in providing the capacity for certain governments to censor and filter Internet material . #% There must be far greater local participation in these decisions . #% The addition of ten or more net beneficiary countries will have a major impact on the budget . #% It is unacceptable that such a punishment is carried out in a country that considers itself advanced . #% Also it is now 20 years since Altiero Spinelli drafted his report , which recommended that a constitutional Treaty be agreed for the European Union and one of the key elements of his report back in 1984 was to give a stronger role to the European Parliament . #% They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments . #% It must release Palestinian monies and it must face an international inquiry into its actions in relation to Lebanon . #% So we in this Parliament must use every means at our disposal to highlight this situation and put pressure on the Kenyan authorities to see whether they will respect basic human rights . #% I have always maintained that on certain issues exchange of best practice and standard setting at EU level can often reap positive results . #% I thank the honourable Member , Mr Cushnahan . #% All countries involved in fishing the relevant stocks , be they coastal states or distant water states , should be involved in assessments of stocks and negotiations over how much fishing is done and who has the right to do it . #% Returning now to the priorities which you have outlined for your presidency , we fully agree with the emphasis you have put on unemployment , organized crime , drugs and fighting fraud . #% Collectively we must defend our rights to choose when and how to engage , or isolate , regimes such as those in Cuba , Libya , Iran or elsewhere . #% First of all , the EU has no power in the field of spatial planning , yet it presumes to chart a course for this on the back of the dead Constitution . #% Secondly , where we get industrial profits as an additional source of funding for renewable energy , will we see a level playing field across the board ? #% The Commission 's Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection published a paper last year on the state of mental health in the European Union . #% It is important that we have equality in the provision of state aid for all convergence regions , including the statistical effect areas . #% The lack of a clear legal base in the Treaty has meant that children ' s specific needs are ignored . #% People want more Europe in certain areas , but if you tell people in the world , or people in Europe , or people in my country , that they will be part of a European army ; that their taxes will be determined by Brussels ; that they will have no say with regard to what kind of a police force they will have , they will reject it out of hand . #% In areas such as Ireland farming incomes have been decimated through no fault of the farmers concerned . #% This report reaffirms that there will be a CAP post 2013 , that it should remain a common policy and that its budget should be at least maintained at current levels . #% I look forward to the future . #% Mr. President , I would like to join with the other speakers in complementing the rapporteur for her work on this very important report . #% Thank you , John , you have done an excellent job . #% Animals should always be slaughtered close to the place where they were reared . #% Following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August . #% Consumers can feel at ease that this technology , which is highly monitored and tightly regulated , will ensure that Europeans continue to be the best fed people in today 's world . #% I also come from a country where meat production , and in particular beef production , is an important economic sector , because we export 85 % of our entire production . #% 
Given that , is there any real reason not to include Malta in the first wave ? #% I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg in France to Kehl in Germany and I stopped and meditated . #% They are certainly not mutually exclusive , as Mr Walter has said in his report , but we believe it will be nominal and real convergence which will support the European Union 's competitiveness with the new Asian Tigers , Japan and the US . #% Companies must be afforded the flexibility they need to stay lean and move swiftly in a highly competitive environment . #% I would also urge that this declaration be accepted as a protocol to the next Treaty changes in 2004 . #% Mr Barroso , you are no longer a Portuguese politician : you are a European politician , selected by this Parliament and by the Council of all of the Member States to represent Europe . #% If European citizens are to support the EU , they must be assured that the EU will deliver for them and their families . #% I support this , but I would strongly suggest that we incorporate into the wording of point 3 that first and foremost , the Union will support the family as the primary and natural educator and protector of the child as is their duty . #% So there it is . #% We must now ensure that those who served the sugar industry loyally for many years receive equitable compensation . #% Mr President , I would like you to take account of the fact that there are many Members who will have to leave for an early flight . #% The British , for example , are always complaining about the flags of convenience and the fact that their own government has failed to decommission and , instead , has sold off its flags of convenience to countries like Spain and France . #% He is accountable to this Parliament - we should not overlook that . #% They are the victims of animal-feed manufacturers who use meat and bone meal in bovine feed and there is some evidence , regrettably , to suggest that unscrupulous manufacturers have continued to use the product since the new regulations were introduced . #% Unfortunately the taxpayer will have to pay the fines but real pressure has to be put on the government at this stage because they have got away with it for far too long . #% For some of them , victims of racism , action can not come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure , I am afraid , will fall on deaf ears in my region ' s organisations . #% Dr William Hesseltine , the chief executive of Human Gene Sciences Inc. , has already patented 100 human genes and his company has submitted applications for 8000 . #% Anyone who believes that in today 's society we can survive without cooperating is living in cloud-cuckoo land . #% In congratulating the presidency on the progress made to date , I would also like to issue a warning . #% Firstly , the continuing attempt to create a European Public Prosecutor 's office , is something which I am resolutely opposed to . #% The authorities have declared that women will be entitled to vote in the future . #% The British Government now assures us that the rules on the disposal of offal and contaminated feed have been strengthened , are being rigorously enforced and are now watertight . #% The report calls on the Eurogroup , the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination . #% It seems the only thing they are willing to listen to is the threat of fines . #% Perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh . #% It takes a while to break down prejudices , but I will certainly support any case that is brought to me on behalf of the Unionist community , just the same as the nationalists , if it is shown that they have not got their share of this money . #% I should also say that I would like to have seen the directive slightly stronger on the protection for redundant landfill sites , because resistance to landfill and also to incineration is very often directly connected to the fears of those who live near these sites that they will not be adequately maintained and protected . #% I would like to say to Mr Fischler that while his message was not an easy one to sell he made a great effort to explain it to the farmers of Europe . #% His contribution was short and sweet but at this stage most of the talking has been done . #% What I do want to say , however , is that I deplore the attitude displayed by Mr Solana here this morning . #% I welcome , therefore , the Commission ' s confirmation of my understanding that enlargement can proceed without the ratification of the Nice Treaty . #% The EU development budget in the next financial framework should increase in real terms and thus contribute to reaching the collective target of spending 0.7 % of GNI on ODA . #% It is also important that the Indonesian Government should replace its Kopassus units because they are seen daily as a threat to the Papuan people . #% Could you tell us what that response was and what was your initial reaction to the letter ? #% However , the most crucial ingredient in tackling this fraud is political will . #% Profitability can not be at the expense of consumer rights and welfare . #% The report also urges EU Member States to implement the Council Directive on residence permits so that the option of temporary residence can be granted to victims of trafficking . #% It is all very well to have products that are labelled according to their area of farming or according status as a traditional speciality , but unless the consumer is aware of its meaning , it is , in fact , like reading an alien language . #% On the one hand , people are saying that drugs should be liberalized and others are saying that we are refusing to deal with the issue . #% Ireland , and in particular Ireland South , has a thriving fishing industry and this Agreement will help to fight against IUU fishing as one of the most serious global threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources . #% From the way in which this interview was received and commented upon that has clearly happened here . #% In view of the recent coverage of , for example , charges for wheelchairs at Dublin Airport by Ryanair , it is important that the Commission comes forward with the promised regulation on the contract between passengers and airlines , particularly for passengers with disabilities . #% The last thing we want is to have our waters opened up to more effort by Spanish fishermen , or indeed any other fishermen . #% We should not seek to reopen the debate as to the merits or demerits of what happened in Iraq earlier this year . #% I was a nurse , I dread to tell you how many years ago , but in those days the technical demands on both doctors and nurses were considerably less than they are now . #% Mr President , when I met the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong , Tung Chee-hwa , earlier this week , I raised a number of concerns relating to recent developments there which do not augur well for the protection of human rights . #% Mr President , this hygiene package consists of a number of elements , all of which are very important : a proposal on general food hygiene , a proposal on food and animal origin and a proposal on official controls mainly concerning slaughterhouses . #% I join with those who have praised the Taoiseach and his team today for the successful conclusion of the constitutional negotiations , in particular the retention of the broad framework , values , objectives and citizens ' rights which the European Convention had negotiated . #% I will not support proposed amendments that would change this constructive report by introducing yet another human rights abuse -- abortion -- into the already abusive situation of war . #% This is an issue that we will return to again in the run-up to the next IGC . #% I know the Commissioner believes very strongly in rural development and , indeed , believes that it is the future for agriculture policy , a view shared by the OECD . #% That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard . #% My views on the present hushkit legislation are on the record . #% Would he not agree with me that this is the case ? #% Secondly , we call for the application of a principle of positive discrimination in favour of the less-favoured regions under the new RDT framework programmes . #% The Taoiseach has certainly intensified the series of bilateral negotiations with other European Union governments with regard to the provisions of a new EU Treaty , but , as the Taoiseach said himself in Strasbourg in January , this is a job one can not do on one 's own . #% Because we need to do much better than this . #% Liberalization should apply to all energy sectors , particularly the nuclear sector where there are huge subsidies from some states . #% This is the first I have heard about the common position arrived at yesterday and I absolutely agree with his point that it simply is not good enough . #% The review of EU animal feed legislation in the wake of the recent series of scares is most welcome as it goes to the root cause of problems that have arisen . #% Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and can not , object to that . #% In 1996 ICAT adopted a resolution saying that the contracting party should promote the use of mono-filament leaders in recreational and long-line fisheries . #% This imbalance is very clear in my own country , Ireland , and I would like to dwell on that for a minute , if I may . #% Canada has no right to try and undermine the democratic will of European citizens by taking our clearly non-discriminatory seal ban law to the World Trade Organisation . #% I believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns . #% I would like to thank colleagues from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their cooperation in helping us to undertake the very important work of scrutiny on which our committee , could spend all its time on if we wished to . #% 
By the middle of next year we will , in effect , have European monetary union for perhaps 80 % of the entire economy of our 15 countries and we should proceed on that basis . #% Total funding will amount to # 20 million and this will be allocated in two principal areas - the exchange of information and cooperation at Community level and the raising of public awareness . #% Finally this is a budgetary matter only . #% I believe that in response to the accident involving the there is a clear need to ensure that full and swift payments can be made to victims of future oil spills , notwithstanding our obligation to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening in the future . #% I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that facilitating the free movement of services is the missing key needed to unlock the potential of the European workforce and galvanise the European economy . #% I urge the Council to convene an urgent and informal meeting of European ministers for health to seek to coordinate a European response . #% I think her remarks addressed earlier to Mrs McNally were actually intended for me , but I am very happy to see that she is not symbolically sporting a headscarf in solidarity with Islamic fundamentalists . #% I thought the Commission was going to come down hard on this whole issue . #% One key argument that has received little acknowledgement in the heated debates so far is the competitiveness case of employing Article 175 to achieve our Lisbon targets of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world , with sustainable growth as an integral part of that objective . #% We have an opportunity after the recent events to rebuild and improve the transatlantic relationship - that has to be the challenge we take on board . #% The implementation of those lines has been heavily criticised in the past . #% Of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the Danish people . #% It is up to the Irish people themselves to decide whether they want to vote in favour or against . #% We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions . #% In the UK and Ireland we indeed have a liberal regime and consumers there do not want their rights restricted . #% The reason why we are not discussing upcoming events , where we can have influence with regard to decisions that will be taken by the 25 Member States , is because certain Members of this House want to re-run previous battles , previous elections , and to try to insist in future elections . #% It is essential that we simplify and modify the VAT collection system to guarantee that success . #% I listened with tremendous interest to Mr van Dam talking about half-baked approaches by the Commission and how well the Dutch fishermen were responding . #% I would ask that this be communicated to the Bureau because something needs to be done about it . #% It would be a travesty if , as a result of late payments , we were to undo all that good work . #% Sweden spends EUR 200 per person as a proportion of GDP , compared to EUR 100 in Ireland , yet Sweden is the third most competitive economy in the world , compared to Ireland 's position at 26th . #% I very much welcome the leadership provided by the new Commissioner , Mr Byrne , and his commitment to the establishment of an EU food safety agency . #% Many of our assistants may lack proper social security and other cover . #% I welcome the debate that took place this week in Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources . #% I would like to correct Mr De Rossa : stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have , to date , produced no treatments , whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments , and it is to be hoped that , some day , there will be a treatment for MS. #% It is more important that it be well spent than that it be all spent . #% - I wish to place on record my satisfaction that current directives governing architects ' qualifications are adequate to enable those who are not currently registered as architects in Ireland to become registered as such . #% Could I just point out the number of outbreaks in the UK yesterday was higher than at any time in the three weeks since the crisis started . #% The principal of that school was earning the equivalent of EUR 150 per month . #% At every critical point during that period , he has caused the Commission to offer to this House solutions that , had they been offered at the outset of each stage , might have worked . #% in writing . - The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement has a mandate which is vital for the protection of Intellectual Property Rights . #% Next week , I will be travelling to the Hague conference , where the special commission will meet to review the practical operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction . #% It is important that we remember that the people in the European Union are entitled to have proper representation in relation to their concerns . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Fruteau , not only for his work to date , but also for sticking with this marathon session ; and I also thank the Commission . #% Can I ask the President-in-Office to initiate a move himself with the Commission to ensure that a proper request is put before the presidency to be dealt with during your term of office ? #% It is not just an issue for the Commission , it is an issue for the Council . #% Finally , I wish to raise some areas where we need to consider the Commission 's proposals in more detail : efficiency , of course , is fundamental to ensure the better use of funds but if the efficiency reserve leads to more red tape and bureaucracy and an increased monitoring role for Commission staff , then I fear that all we will be doing is employing more private consultants in order to monitor those processes . #% Surely it is a matter of concern to the Council when two Member States combine to exclude an EU monitoring body from their indigenous freedom of information legislation and so exempt it from provisions on providing the public with information that is available from all internal governmental bodies in those states . #% I do not agree with the decision adopted today which seeks to give the European Union the power to impose criminal sanctions on people who breach intellectual property rights . #% The problem is set to get worse , as waste quantities will increase significantly over the next decades . #% It was not uncommon for farmers -- and these are not large farms -- to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry . #% We also have an obligation to maintain the European model of agriculture , which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community . #% Therefore , I ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the amendments and to recognise them in the spirit in which they have been tabled , as a genuine attempt to ensure that Europe develops good patent law in the field of computer-implemented inventions . #% This would result in the cost of maternity leave in the UK doubling . #% I believe you should not launch your project in such a sea of political and institutional ambiguity . #% I also take this opportunity to wish her all the best in the election to become President of Ireland . #% I would also ask the Commissioner to think again about the whole situation as far as the Organization of African Unity is concerned and its desire to intervene directly in the situation there , to bring about peace and stability insofar as that can be arrived at . #% They are the largest man-made radioactive emissions and pollutants and do not pollute just EU Member States but migrate across the globe . #% It is important that we do not let this day go by without acknowledging the initiative taken by Germany , France and Belgium in proposing further United Nations intervention in Iraq to consolidate the search for weapons of mass destruction in that country . #% That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with ! #% The UN and the Red Cross should have compulsory access to all prisoners everywhere and the UN should have a daily-updated register of all prisoners in all UN member states . #% The situation has altered substantially . #% I would like to thank the Members , and especially my own colleagues , for their support for the Dell application and ask as well that they will support further applications in similar circumstances coming down the road from Waterford Crystal and SR Technics . #% We endorse the resolution , especially the comments about the lack of overall analysis , and criticisms by the Commission of the Member States and the lack of progress in monitoring the marketing channels . #% Why was British Nuclear Fuels unwilling to release enough information to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to enable it to assess the safety of nuclear storage at Sellafield ? #% On a continental level , the enlargement of the European Union will contribute to further stability . #% Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste . #% This all happened in front of witnesses who seem to have seen nothing . #% I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members . #% Your own country , like California , has recently suffered major power cuts following liberalisation . #% The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing . #% I support everything that the rapporteur has said . #% I have always believed that Turkey 's accession would provide an important bridgehead between the West and the Islamic world . #% But there is no reason , with an up-turn , that we should not , with public procurement and public funds , be launching far more satellites in the future for public , citizen benefit . #% So you must correct this if it is an incorrect reflection of your views in that interview . #% I call upon the Council today to amend the Treaty to include a specific , legally sound reference to children and to citizens ' rights for them . #% 
You can not rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place . #% There are practices with regard to medical devices and new technologies which are in use in one Member State and are not even discussed in another . #% Would she also accept that in my country , Ireland , the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union , because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union . #% I therefore call upon the Commission to sanction an approach capable of delivering a solution and securing the purpose of single farm payments , namely a fair standard of living for farmers . #% If people have property rights , they will invest in building and constructing properties that have some chance of resisting future damage of this kind . #% The Committee of Inquiry made its point clearer than Parliament has ever been able to do , so the public was able to read in a very clear way where the failings were . #% I also know that the Commission is the best friend of the smaller Member States within the European Union , which can count on protection when they need it . #% I am also glad that Commissioner De Gucht is going there and that he will report to the Committee on Development when he returns on Monday . #% We are not a mendicant seeking alms at the European door . #% A fully operational Europol is critical to ensuring successful cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs . #% It is inappropriate to seek to use budgetary procedure as a means of shaping that policy . #% I do not want my part of the United Kingdom , Northern Ireland , treated instead as part of the territorial whole of the island of Ireland . #% The security issues must be addressed , but not at the expense of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians . #% I acknowledge , of course , as you have reported , the heightened anxieties of the representatives of the candidate countries following the Irish `` no '' to Nice . #% There is no doubt that the British Government made very serious mistakes in its handling of the BSE crisis , but after much delay it has now put in place a well funded and scientifically based eradication programme which is working well . #% We do not want to build a two-tier Europe , or a Europe of the haves and have nots . #% Mr President , I would like to ask the Commission when they propose to deal with the report which was commissioned by DG XIV - reference PEM/306 - concerning the physical interaction between grey seals , fishing gear and the abnormal predatory conditions of the seals in the North Atlantic , the North-West Atlantic and now penetrating into the South Atlantic . #% The EU ' s demonstration programme on integrated management of coastal zones , funded by LIFE , has proved that implementation of integrated coastal zone management results in both economic and environmental benefits . #% Generally , you have a very good line -- up . #% To collect car taxes for a reason like environmental protection makes sense . #% There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen . #% It needs to be demonstrated that this is the case , because this will help to ensure the added value I spoke of . #% It is important -- indeed essential -- to determine the exact position in which we find ourselves at the earliest possible opportunity . #% It is clear that a successful foreign policy can not stand on one pillar alone . #% It is not necessary , for example , for this text to complain about the policies which are not in the new treaty . #% All right-minded people support the Roadmap for peace because this will ensure the creation of a future Palestinian State with territorial contiguity . #% They need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to Belfast to reach airports and everywhere else . #% Mr President , just before you commence the voting , I would like to draw your attention to the rules of this House and to the avalanche of lobbyists that are in the corridor outside this House . #% In Ireland we are developing a nationalist strategy to ease administrative burdens and small businesses , relieve burdens on small businesses and improve access to finance , as well as support business start-ups . #% The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy , particularly in the enlarged European Union . #% I congratulate you , Mr Martin , for a first-class report on this important subject and I hope that the unanimous vote of approval in the Committee on Fisheries will be echoed by a unanimous vote in the House today . #% in writing . - With the growth of the European research and innovation programmes and those applying for funding , it is important that those who are applying for it will not be bogged down with the process and this move to simplify the programme is much welcomed . #% Of particular note is the fact that the growth of the US economy , which has outperformed Europe 's economy since Lisbon -- the gap has grown , not lessened -- is driven by its superior research and development . #% I very much regret this but I must condemn a statement made by Ireland 's Minister for Justice last Monday , where he accused those who argue for a more rational and open immigration policy of simply proposing an open door policy on immigration . #% The German Society of Human Genetics , through its chair , states : ' We are opposed to the patenting of the human genome and the DNA sequences it contains . #% If we are to offset the effects of global warming and the resulting damage to the global economy , we must reduce the level of greenhouse gases . #% I hope the day will come when passports will not be used anywhere within the European Union . #% There will be more time for those later . #% in writing . - I voted to change the 2012 calendar to save taxpayers ' money , to save CO2 emissions and to lessen the disruption to Parliament business by the monthly trip to Strasbourg . #% Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries . #% It is important also that the precise role of the European Union President / President of the European Council is clearly specified in the new Treaty . #% It has refused to take up any of our suggestions to safeguard jobs and ensure safety standards are improved . #% The honourable Member has raised a very important point . #% That , in itself , is vital for Europe 's potential for economic growth in the future . #% The degree of energy wasted by the political leaders of Europe in trying to foist an unwanted Constitution on our people is quite staggering . #% An effective evaluation of the measures we put into place is essential . #% It shows that big as the European Union is , we have institutions that are capable of dealing with the problems which arise from day-to-day . #% There is need for a full review of the technical standards to ensure that safety standards are fully met whilst at the same time aircraft that are satisfactorily functioning from every point of view are not lost to our fleets . #% I mention that because we use education and health programmes to combat cancer and the Anderstown News recently revealed the deep involvement of the IRA in illicit cigarette smuggling . #% Mr President , firstly heartiest congratulations to Claude Desama for achieving this uncompleted business for us over the time-scale involved . #% I am also really concerned about the question of exports from Palestine and the difficulties many producers are still experiencing when trying to export their goods - and I understand fully the need for security and everything else - because of an excessive amount of rather exigent security checks at the border . #% It is incumbent on us to ensure that some financial support would be available under these programmes , either at European or national level . #% I welcome the commitment of EU leaders to continue with a multilateral approach to trading issues . #% Today , more than ever , we need Eurojust and Europol to deal effectively with the individuals who prey on the misery and desperation of others . #% I should also say that it is not right to try and buy success by throwing endless supplies of taxpayers ' money at European parties . #% The doctors ' organisations , the patients ' organisations throughout Europe are pleading with us not to specifically exclude paid donations . #% I would like to take it further and have a social evaluation of the money we spend , to find out whether or not we contribute to the improvement of the economic and social situation of certain regions in Spain or France , where this money is supposed to go , or whether in fact we just give a licence to a small number of people , who control quite a lot of capital , to exploit the waters of a country which is in no position to control its own resources . #% This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals . #% The worst European tsunami in recorded history occurred on 1 November 1755 , when a powerful earthquake off Portugal 's Atlantic coast sent waves crashing into Lisbon . #% I am very pleased that she realises , as we all do , the added European value of telecommunications for all of the Lisbon agenda . #% Up to 800 000 women are victims of trafficking every year , 100 000 of them in the European Union . #% It is worth noting that , unlike competing global positioning systems -- notably American ones -- our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes . #% Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses . #% So , what do we have to do ? #% There is an overwhelming and immediate need to protect and care for the victims of war , to stop the genocide and to find a solution acceptable to all sides , including respect for and understanding of the needs of neighbouring countries . #% After several rounds of negotiations starting in Brussels in January 2001 no agreement was reached between the EU and Senegal on the renewal of the current protocol . #% 
The rate of growth of the sector and its diversity both make it one where future regulation will be necessary . #% It is in contradiction with Article 153 . #% However , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties . #% I would ask you to convey my objections at least , if not the objections of many others in this Parliament , to this operation by the United States . #% A huge number of jobs are involved and maintaining duty-free has particular relevance for regional development . #% If we are serious about this , we must be prepared to make funds available for research and development in this area , both at national and European levels . #% Yet pursuant to a derogation under Article 15 of that directive , the United Kingdom Government is permitted to practise discrimination against Protestants in Northern Ireland who apply to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland , solely because they are Protestants . #% Mr President , it is very clear that there has to be clear labelling . #% Between 1991 and 1994 the SAVE programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field . #% They may be pretty with their heads out of the water but they are not so pretty beneath the sea where they are devouring thousands of tonnes of very precious fish and food for the people of Europe . #% On the issue we are debating here today , I would like to say that we face a weekend that is immensely important for the Union . #% They urge companies to sign up to directory services which are presented as being free of charge . #% Mr President , I share the view of Saddam Hussein expressed in this House . #% In discussing this matter , we should not create the feeling - which some people have done and have been trying to do - that , in some way or another , the European Union 's treasury is a more leaky vessel than those of the Member States or similar treasuries throughout the world . #% I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity . #% We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission . #% Every year in the European Union around 45,000 people die and about 1.6 million are injured as a result of road traffic accidents . #% But I would say to you : be engaged in that election ; maintain your political conviction ; and fight the cause with those colleagues whose list you will not now head . #% The only way we are going to get governments to respect EU law is to impose fines if they do not do so . #% What procedures have been put in place ? #% The Hutus were defeated by the Tutsis and disarmed a year ago and now they seem to be rearmed . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by offering my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for a very balanced report . #% We must remember that when the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified and comes into force it will have an employment chapter . #% By the standards that they apply , I want to state categorically that the Commission would pass with first-class honours : our rate of fraud and error is below what is acceptable in those countries . #% . I am fully supportive of the ideas in the Commission communication . #% The Irish Government has recently indicated its opposition to this measure , having kept its mouth shut very tightly since the subject was first mooted by the Commission in 2000 . #% The applicant countries have made substantial progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria , with regard both to the transposition of legislation and to the implementation of new European regulations and directives covering a wide range of economic and social sectors . #% For example , India described its only nuclear test as a ` peaceful nuclear explosion ' , but it still used the results to develop its weapons programme . #% A second institutional issue still to be decided concerns the future operation of the presidency of the Council of Ministers . #% Indeed , unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States . #% We favour a quick deal but it is conditional on the Council and the Commission accepting our amendments , which are a genuine and committed attempt to ensure that the brave new world of electronic communications is genuinely universal . #% If the world 's poor need food to eat and clean water to drink -- and we know they do -- then Doha was never going to deliver that to them . #% We have had enough of this . #% I have ongoing concerns about the number of times issues around a legal basis arise in this Parliament . #% Today 's budget in Ireland reflects the good health of our celtic tiger . #% We need very strong ... #% I do not believe that support from the citizens of the Union for the EU extends to the area of deciding taxation levels in Europe . #% Commissioner , do you deny that you made such a statement ? #% The effect of the environment legal base is substantively the same as the single market ( Article 95 ) base , which also allows Member States to take stricter measures . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , the most important thing we have to remember here today is the people 's lives that are affected by the new wave of violence in the Palestinian Territories . #% If we include this , then many of my colleagues who have reservations , will vote yes . #% I would maintain that acceptance of the deal struck in conciliation is the best solution for Parliament but we must learn the lessons , particularly in our negotiations on the Fifth Framework Programme . #% Also , a lot of the services that should be provided for people on the Internet are not provided . #% It is not , and I think that he was very ill-advised to add this discordant note to an otherwise more or less acceptable report . #% I am not sure about the implications of Amendment No 9 , which covers the Commission 's proposals on the transmission of information received by the Commission to the competent authorities of the Member States . #% Staging posts allow animals to be unloaded , watered and rested , and also the essential cleaning and rebedding of trucks . #% Mr President , my group will be supporting a number of the compromise amendments that have been put forward . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Malta 's accession , I am delighted that Malta was there yesterday at the European Conference and that such a welcome was given to its renewed application for membership of the European Union . #% We want the citizens of Europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe . #% We have , I believe , an historic opportunity now for a new beginning in which we can leave behind us our terrible and tragic past . #% That can give Ireland a value added income of approximately # 300m at today 's prices and that is three times the amount our sheep farmers are able to earn from the entire production of sheep in Ireland at the moment . #% It is estimated that an EU/Mercosur deal could reduce Irish beef prices by 30 % which would inflict losses of up to EUR 500 million in Ireland alone . #% Mr President , I support Commissioner Monti 's initiative and I am pleased that his Commission colleagues are also supporting him . #% They must be as good as their word and ensure that those empty Annexes are filled . #% I do not wish , Mr Prodi , to anticipate the hearings of Parliament but I do have a question : in the event that Parliament decided that one ro more of the nominee Commissioners was not acceptable , what would you propose to do , given the powers you have under the Treaty of Amsterdam ? #% For that reason , I wish to ask , firstly , as I have done already , for copies and , secondly , to ask , not necessarily now but perhaps to be advised at your discretion in writing , what procedures are open to a Member of the House to follow through . #% We should not mix up development aid with an economic policy that the Community is pursuing in relation to fishing . #% There should be more consultation when administrative changes of this kind are made . #% -- Mr President , what we have heard here this morning is , regrettably , vintage McCreevy . #% I expected honesty and I expected the facts . #% Subject to that , the Liberal Group supports the timetable set out by the Commission . #% Mr President , I fully subscribe to and take as read what has been said so far in relation to the identification and traceability of beef and all beef products . #% I voted `` yes '' and I resent the implication that by doing so I am pro-abortion , anti-neutrality , pro-NATO , pro-nuclear power , pro-euthanasia . #% We will have a majority by the end of next week for the Treaty of Nice . #% Quite a lot of other matters have been raised . #% Finally , a plea for the whisky industry : what is the transition situation ? #% 
The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication . #% This surely neither is good neighbourliness nor reflects an . #% I would like to raise the specific case of Berhanu Nega , the elected Mayor of Addis Ababa . #% As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases , owing to their high global warming potential -- GWP -- came to be recognised as a major contributor -- up to 5 % and rising -- to the greenhouse effect . #% The countries that have high tax , high unemployment and low growth are the ones that want to harmonise tax . #% First of all , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% Mr President , most people think that the situation in Iran has changed slightly in recent times but it is still very much the same . #% I wish to say to my colleagues on the use of embryos : let us be clear , we can not commercialize the use of embryos . #% Make no mistake , this war is about oil . #% Of all the groups , none are currently in threat of their lives simply because they belong to that grouping -- except the disabled . #% I believe it was very fitting that John Hume , who has played a most significant role in getting the peace process to where it is today , should have been our main speaker . #% This is a big task but it can be done . #% How will the external impact of the industry strategy be evaluated ? #% I am conscious of the need for continuity in the research area , both in terms of the integrity of the work being undertaken and the engagement of personnel on projects . #% As Mr van Dam said , there is a tremendous problem , there is tremendous concern and we have to ensure the future of cod for the future of fishermen . #% The best approach is the multi-track approach , taking the best from each individual part . #% If the President can confirm this , I think it is not a bad performance and shows that we are coming to terms with the problem . #% This would mean one less headache for citizens considering temporary residency in another Member State . #% It also concluded that the siege of Gaza is tantamount to collective punishment of the 1.5 m population , contrary to international law . #% Today , headlines , reports and editorials in a serious daily newspaper , the , stated that Mr Prodi believed that any state voting against the constitutional treaty now in its final stages of negotiation should logically leave the EU . #% There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme . #% After all they deal with the same subject , and I would like to think that the same spirit will prevail in the House when both reports are voted on tomorrow . #% The women were from 22 different Arab countries . #% This is a deal-breaker for us . #% The proposals put forward are unrealistic and impractical . #% I do not view the document as perfect by any means , however , and I would be critical on two points in particular . #% I remember a plan was produced which was based on two simple things : intensive advice and a little bit of financial incentive . #% At the same time , however , it would be unwise to underestimate the importance of risk management in the traditional areas of credit and market risks . #% Much of the report , I feel , is very badly drafted and very repetitive . #% Madam President , I want to support the rapporteur 's point that there could be a greater awareness of the European contribution to this fund . #% You can not wash your hands of it and say ` Oh well , that is the individual responsibility of the Member State ' . #% The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community . #% In every single Member State of the European Community ALTENER promotes renewable energy . #% It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process , even if not yet a stable government . #% We will be looking for a roll-call vote on this aspect of the report tomorrow . #% Commissioner , you have failed to answer my question . #% Mr Lechner should be aware that the judgement is interim and that we will not have a final judgement until the autumn . #% All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for its impact on enterprise and competitiveness . #% Swine fever , like foot-and-mouth , does re-emerge from time to time in different Member States throughout the European Union . #% Nuclear accidents do not respect borders and no Member State can act on its own . #% I can assure you that the Quaestors are working on it . #% The objective is to protect the democratic prerogatives of the European Parliament , as provided for in the Lisbon Treaty . #% We are concerned that the way in which Europe is developing creates real risks for the safety , protection and wellbeing of its young citizens . #% in writing . - I was pleased to support this proposal and would like to express my country 's appreciation for the solidarity funding allocated to our country as a result of November 2009 flooding . #% Rather than going over ground already covered by previous speakers , I would just like to underline that the overall content of what we want to see happening within Parliament with regard to the new Commission is clearly laid out and enunciated within that resolution , which also takes into account the framework agreement as revised . #% The vast majority of the political goals that it set at the start of the year have been met and that is a commendable achievement . #% The need for stricter regulation and supervision of the financial crisis is as urgent as ever . #% I have to say that the majority of these problems and restructuring come indeed from the strength of cost competition from developing countries . #% Apart from the obvious benefit of bio-ethanol as an alternative energy source and its potential contribution to a cleaner environment , some of the by-products produced would also be of value to the fertiliser and animal feed sectors . #% With few exceptions , European society today is very tolerant . #% Both of those propositions are utterly discredited and if you look at the figures for poverty , for homelessness and for social dislocation in this Union , you will understand why . #% This is a challenge that the EU must rise to . #% A considerable number of actions to fight cyber-crime are already under way in international fora . #% I have not received an answer . #% There may be other such incidents before the process is concluded . #% In conclusion , I believe we all support the intensification of talks between the European Union governments so as to ensure that agreement can be reached concerning the provisions of the treaty . #% The banning of the advertising and promotion of tobacco products within the Union is a positive step in the right direction , so that this very important social objective is achieved . #% In conclusion , while road safety is a major issue and death and injury on our roads are at frightening levels - 40 000 per annum in the EU - like many colleagues I balk at yet another European agency and feel that national authorities should be able to plan strategies suitable to their particular set of circumstances . #% The main priority of the European Union is jobs . #% Such feed should only be used for this therapeutic purpose ; they should only be used under strict licence and under strict supervision . #% Everyone recognises that there is a problem in the Irish Box and that there is a problem with stocks . #% Would the Council consider giving more support to foundations like the Clinton Foundation , which has proven to be so successful in individual countries ? #% Instead of penalising women for having children , the EU needs to support them and help them better balance work and family life . #% For that , we need a legal base . #% Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by a gang of thugs and criminals masquerading as Republican political activists or IRA freedom fighters . #% Your words , President-in-Office , about fruitful discussions , re-focusing on key issues , sustainable growth in employment etc. etc. etc. , could be those of any President-in-Office over the last four years : they have all said exactly the same . #% 
I have circulated to Members a list of those patients ' organizations who oppose the patenting of human gene sequences . #% Labour Euro MPs opposed the rapporteur 's amendments to weaken the committee report , including a lower requirement for representation of women , a slower timetable for action on pay reform and less information on staff pay . #% However , despite repeated requests , Commission officials have so far failed to provide a copy of this document . #% Instead , I am speaking as an MEP on behalf of myself and of my people . #% The most effective single action that the European Union can take to resolve this problem is to decrease the size of its fleet . #% Specifically on my supplementary , there is a major concern about the medical councils in the Member States and , in particular , for my own country , Ireland , with regard to ensuring minimum standards of training and qualification for doctors and other people in the medical profession . #% When we talk about the polluter-pays principle , the multinationals must be held accountable for the fact that conventional farmers , and in particular organic farmers , are not going to be allowed to do what they have done in the past . #% Hence our abstention on the two reports . #% That should be the culture ; that must be the ethos we foster . #% Instead , intended ambiguity prevails so as to facilitate Morocco 's abuse of Western Saharan waters and to avoid facing up to its illegal claim to the territory . #% There will be access to a frontier-free trading bloc encompassing over 20 European countries , assuming that the accession negotiations with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe prove successful . #% The companies who operate universal public services and the Member States have a responsibility to ensure that they are delivered and that the workers in these companies have legal certainty . #% We must not forget that the business of agriculture is about producing food in the first place and we must ensure that food is safe . #% Those people are forgotten today in our discussions . #% I greatly welcome his emphasis on the need for monitoring and the need for the European Parliament to be involved in such monitoring - not just in the JRC . #% It does not support the patenting of human gene sequences . #% I have observed this before . #% Road traffic in Dublin has grown exponentially in the last decade , as we have experienced record growth levels in our economy . #% All people should be entitled to their full social , economic and cultural equality . #% It is worth noting that European investment in Burma is significant , particularly in the oil and gas industries . #% There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment . #% I also firmly believe that if the authority is to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe , it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner , dedicated to the assessment of food-safety risk . #% The proposal before us today is intended to replace existing European Union directives which govern this important energy policy matter . #% We had hoped that we would get away with it unscathed but it shows just how dangerous and highly contagious this disease is , through the way animals move . #% It is true that we talk the talk of human rights , but too often , it seems to me , we hold back when there are economic interests which we seem to hold dearer . #% Many of those arriving in certain Member States - and indeed in my own - are being treated extremely badly , particularly by employers who are not themselves subject to the kind of controls that are applied to apparently legal immigrants into the country . #% The opening of negotiations with six applicant countries this week in Brussels constitutes an historic step in the evolution of the European Union . #% It is quite clear that the fortress mentality of Europe is what is causing people to put their lives at risk , by trusting people who are trying to make a profit . #% We should have the same rights as US citizens if there is any agreement , that is fundamental . #% These methods could be applied to other sectors or issues if necessary . #% For the first time the provisional movement has been shaken to the core by the depth of reaction from within its own community . #% Mr Cornelissen has put his finger on the pulse . #% I think we are all agreed that it is not a zero-sum game and it is in every Member State 's interest to welcome in new members because of the generation of income and the new trading relationships that will bring about . #% These are proliferating in my own country . #% I would appreciate it if you would be open to amending the way in which this matter is being handled . #% Israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza . #% We have to find a resolution as quickly as possible to the present situation and , in the long term , we have got to improve our response mechanisms to this type of situation . #% We need to find innovative and workable solutions to ensuring the health and safety of domestic workers and , in the overall context , to ensure that their rights are fully respected . #% But a lot is in the hands of the politicians in both communities in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , after 30 long years of negotiations , the Employment and Social Affairs Ministers managed to reach agreement last December on a statute for a European company . #% I agree with the rapporteur that this report is not about harmonisation ; it is about better coordination of the social security systems in Member States . #% Much of that is genetically modified and it is ironic that European consumers are concerned about GM and yet we have to rely on GM protein for much of our animal feed . #% Bringing about this change has taken -- and will continue to take -- time , effort and investment , a fact that is reflected in the 2011-2012 timetable set in the revised packaging directive for Greece , Portugal and Ireland . #% That actually is quite a broad perspective and anything can happen within that . #% You also , if I understood the translation correctly , believe that the Treaty should be simplified but without changing its content . #% I urge everyone here today to support this amendment . #% Proper regulation of working time is a cornerstone for social Europe . #% Mr President , I just wish to say that I agree with the rapporteur on the necessity of one vote on Amendments Nos 5 , 6 and 14 . #% We must ensure that EU firms operating outside the EU treat their employees fairly , both in terms of the remuneration they receive and adequate health and safety standards in their workplace . #% This is what we need to do : to assess if what we now have is an improvement or otherwise . #% His draft resolution recognizes that agricultural compensation will need to be put into place so that all sectors of society can benefit from the EMU regime . #% We are coming to the end of a long week . #% Eventually that approach , which allows Member States to decide on the basis of river-basin management plans -- which under the Framework Directive will eventually manage all freshwater sources once they are put in place -- will also allow Member States to manage their nitrate and pesticide pollutants . #% There is no reason why every single institution should not take a hard look at itself to determine what the most important issues to be tackled are and how legislation can be improved and made more relevant to the people . #% in writing . - ECR Group MEPs supported this report as we believed that the legal basis of this legislation should be changed from ` Article 31 EAEC ' to ` Article 168 TFEU ' . #% I would say to my eloquent friend , Sir Robert Atkins , that , whilst he described me and the rapporteur as roses , we intend rather to be thorns in the side of the system , because there is something rotten here . #% Commissioner , it is within your and the Council 's powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way . #% Perhaps we should review this at some stage in the near future and look at it anew to try to come up with a better solution . #% It is not yet clear if any decisive moves will be taken in 1996 to start serious work on what the Maastricht Treaty describes as the eventual framing of a common defence policy . #% If sugar beet is sacrificed today , as it has been in Ireland , what about EU beef farming tomorrow ? #% The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages , such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets . #% That is the reality of this . #% As you know , in the original directive of 1985 on the recognition of architects ' qualifications , certain Member States did not get derogations for what is known as an established right to practice . #% It beggars belief that , in a so-called civilised society in the 21st century , there is still trophy hunting . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council , as well as the Vice-President of the Commission , for their presentations and contributions . #% Mr President , when I spoke earlier I said I should like to reserve the right to speak again . #% 
Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament . #% Firstly , in relation to the discrimination in the share-out of the milk quota , Ireland has a very legitimate claim in relation to additional quota . #% It is an issue of interest , not only to the European Union , but to the world and those who want to see Macau and Hong Kong progress , so that basic freedoms are guaranteed and are not eroded by the country to which they have been handed back . #% Could I finally say that we should ease up a little on the ageism in relation to the praesidium . #% I am sure Parliament will agree that in the context of the present discussions on Agenda 2000 the viability of many family farms will be put at risk . #% Finally we also highlight the importance , in all awareness and education campaigns , of the ability to recognise the symptoms of dementia . #% Mr President , we read about this being Green Week , and the focus of this year 's Green Week is biodiversity loss . #% We clearly need a joined-up approach by various departments . #% We have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us . #% I say ` perceived ' threat because some of the headlines in the media over the last six to seven months suggest that the end of the world is imminent and there is no escape from the dangers and the risks presented by the spread of avian flu . #% Issues of personal morality are not matters to be legislated for by the Commission , nor for us here ; they are for our national governments and private individuals to decide . #% That should be resisted . #% This Parliament from the outset has championed the cause of including fishermen and their legitimate representatives in the decision making process . #% The current diet of misinformation and distorted facts must cease . #% By tying the two together - salary and expenses - we are avoiding the fact that the system needs to be changed . #% The Commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical . #% Already burdened by huge amounts of EU red tape , many SMEs with limited manpower simply do not have the capacity or time to go through the current application processes . #% Like others I have some doubts about the wisdom in the Euratom part of the Fifth Framework Programme of spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of ECUs on research into nuclear fusion which will not generate electricity in the lifetime of anyone in this Chamber tonight . #% Finally , when we speak about an area of freedom , security and justice , it is justice which must be first and foremost among those aims and ideals , because , unless we can guarantee people that their individual rights and freedoms are protected , then we will have failed in our first duty as legislators , namely , to ensure that the laws that we pass not only protect the common good , but do not adversely affect the minority . #% In conclusion , it is my firm belief that if the Union wishes to remain relevant , then modernisation of its laws and policies must always be voted in favour of . #% In Holland , potentially lower VAT rates and labour-intensive services produced headlines about cheaper haircuts . #% Madam President , let me begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on their very hard work over a very long period of time . #% It should not be an ` us and them ' situation ; it should be about everyone working together for the betterment of all people in the 25 Member States -- or perhaps the 27 Member States , should that come about . #% For that reason I felt both challenged and privileged to work on this report . #% I would like to see a room here where just Members can go to talk amongst themselves in private . #% It was therefore decided to extend the protocol by one year and a new protocol was initialled by both parties on 16 June 2000 . #% I attempted to delete paragraph 125 , but was unsuccessful in doing so ( the vote was narrowly lost ) . #% It is a complete cop-out because the testing ban is just going to ensure that EU multinationals will carry out animal testing outside the EU but the products will still be for sale here . #% You should increase the pressure on the seven Member States which have either failed to ratify or failed to sign the Convention . #% It is thus desirable for the Community to be represented in an institution whose goals coincide with an area of its competence , and whose Statute has already been signed by 20 Member States . #% President Clinton ' s hypocrisy , which has already been highlighted today , is unacceptable . #% I come from a country where we are very proud of our public services . #% I believe the decision that was arrived at at the Conference of Presidents reflected a consensus view , which was a collective wisdom , and you have enunciated that view here today . #% The majority , therefore , in the temporary committee , whose aim it was to draw up ethical guidelines for the European Union , rejects the research funding suggested in the Caudron report . #% The policy of non-cooperation which the British Government is now pursuing in Brussels has had an entirely negative impact and must be abandoned at the earliest opportunity . #% I ask the Commissioner today , who has been doing an extremely good job , to consider increasing the level of sampling as an initial step . #% Mr President , most of what needs saying has been said at this point . #% At one level it may be that this is possible , because clearly an investor in pension funds is interested in having a stable market . #% Many varieties of seed , both cereal and vegetable , are no longer in everyday use . #% The Conference of Presidents assumes that the committee will then wish to incorporate any of the relevant observations and conclusions into its proper , ordinary work which serves this House so well . #% Apart from having the Presidency , it is a particularly important case for Austria . #% Indeed , here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barón Crespo . #% Therefore , I regret to say that my final vote on this project will be seriously affected . #% Mr President , I had expected to recommend the House to adopt this draft regulation unamended at second reading . #% We seriously want the socio-economic implications of every piece of research to be looked at in the Fifth Framework Programme . #% To compound the situation , many of them were in left-hand-drive cars which they had brought from their own homes in Eastern Europe . #% It is not the first time that Holland has saved Europe from political tyranny . #% It should also work to the advantage of any Member State to which a person moves , as it will ensure that an accurate assessment may be made of that individual 's qualifications . #% Many colleagues today have spoken on the basis of experience in their own countries of how these issues are handled . #% They brief us extremely well after the event , outside the door , but we are never let in , not even as observers at the high-level meetings . #% It also deals with the law in Belgium which apparently allows the arrest of people suspected of war crimes . #% When you mention the reduction of capacity in the Irish fleet , you are overlooking the fact that the Veronica is the reduction and that it has now gone to a flag-of-convenience country where it can fish without any controls whatsoever . #% It is essential that there is both earmarked money for international cooperative research - we suggest EUR 400 million - and mainstreaming across all the research , particularly on HIV/AIDS malaria and tuberculosis . #% Mr President , I should also like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur for a job well done and for his efforts to obtain consensus , which were not altogether successful in my case , as I continued to insist that we deal with a lower surface area than it was possible to agree on . #% The quota and the TACs which the Irish , sharing their prolific fishing grounds with the larger countries , receive was a bad deal . #% I take issue with one point in the opening of the first paragraph of his report which says that there is considerable doubt about the whole question of EMU , or words to that effect . #% We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases , which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer . #% There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it . #% Mr Howitt mentioned the Commission and its commitment to bringing forward a directive by the end of the year . #% Parliament is seeking , in this debate at least , to give some guidance to the Commission as to how it should proceed with regard to services of general interest , both economic and non-economic . #% I come to international activities , because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well . #% I supported Amendment 170 in order to put down a marker that there is a need to control the issue of marketing of unhealthy foodstuffs to children . #% So what we require of him is to look after those millions of unemployed and to take that into account . #% The Commission can support fully , in part , or in principle 8 amendments : 3 , 4 , 5 , 14 , 17 , 23 , 31 , 34 . #% President-in-Office , you mentioned in your first answer the need to stay within the parameters of the Berlin Agreement of 1999 . #% This has now been excluded as a conservation area , with a serious reduction in the Irish Box which now is only to cover the southwest area . #% 
At the Conference of Presidents it was also said , acknowledged and understood that in the normal course of events , apart from that political debate , the substance and conclusions of the work of the experts will revert to the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% We are in favour of voluntary action but if it is true that the airlines have known for 30 years about the risks of DVT then maybe we need legislation . #% We waste # 150 million each year by having 11 sessions here in Strasbourg . #% The proposed directive , which requires an environmental assessment before the adoption of a regional or county plan , makes good environmental and economic sense . #% I agree with the rapporteur that much of the problem is linked to the gap between free market conditions we now enjoy and the lack of harmonisation of rules on working conditions . #% In fact , I am surprised that your words about social models have caused such a stir . #% However , we are surprised that Members of this House voted for the original proposal in paragraph 7 to cut off funds to some of our poorest regions in the EU . #% Many new Member States have been pressing the Commission for some time to deal with the availability problem , taking particular account of the unique situation of horses . #% We have an obligation to raise the question of Lampedusa and the appalling treatment of the hundreds of poor and weak people who are deported by the Italian Government to a regime which would not qualify for membership of this Union . #% Today , 25 November , 7 650 ILO conventions have been ratified globally , with 47 in the last 12 months . #% We in the Committee on Budgetary Control do that on the basis of a report from the Court of Auditors and the Commission 's annual financial statement . #% There are also signs of concern in Britain about sub-prime lending . #% We would all welcome the setting of standards of quality for blood products . #% The delay has been unwarranted and undignified and it has cast you in a light and in a role where you do not properly belong . #% Mr President , Commissioner , many questions have been asked today and time does not permit me to repeat them , particularly those questions asked by my colleague , Liam Hyland , and indeed colleague De Rossa in relation to the proportionality of the response . #% But there would be some amusement in some of the more rural parts of Ireland at the tone of the debate . #% If the Structural Funds are taken out of the calculation , there was no problem with the rest of the budget . #% It becomes more urgent because new freedoms are emerging even as I speak , as we can see in the television pictures from Kabul . #% While free movement facilitates trafficking in terms of the removal of border controls , on the other hand , one would imagine that increased police cooperation should be in a position to tackle the problem . #% In particular I want to mention partnership , which is crucial because it involves civil society , environmental partners and NGOs working in close cooperation with all the partners . #% While I welcome the personal guarantee given by Chief Secretary Donald Tsang that he will not allow the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens to be undermined , this must be reflected in the proposed legislation . #% I want to emphasise variable rate mortgages . #% A number of key elements that were mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech are deserving of more in-depth analysis and comment . #% So we have to wonder just how committed the Irish Government is to tackling the problem if it continues to support the Council 's very watered-down amendments . #% Farmers throughout Europe see the European Union as being responsible for agriculture . #% We need to exclude the exportation of waste and indeed , as has already been said , the timetable is way out of line with what the Member States can achieve . #% Would you agree that the Commission has been remiss in the way it did not conduct adequate studies into the effect of the abolition of duty-free ? #% Citizenship belongs to nation states . #% On one hand it disingenuously accepts a Protocol apparently accepting Cyprus , but at the same time issues a declaration disavowing any such recognition . #% I quote from OECD : ' Monetary policy will have to be used to avoid this short-run risk . #% Could you please expand on that and not leave it in suspended animation ? #% I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular , and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea 's electricity plants , by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient , by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy , bio-mass and geothermics . #% I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion . #% With regard to the allocation for biotechnology , this has been vastly increased . #% For the equestrian and racing industries , Saturday , Sunday and bank holiday Mondays must be covered for the movement of animals for breeding or for emergency operations or for competition purposes - because the horse does not carry , it is not susceptible . #% However , I have to say that I am disappointed that the UK is not prepared to implement the territorial employment pacts and I ask Commissioner Flynn what he is prepared to do in order to gain its support . #% It is important , for example , that European leaders reaffirm their commitment to the central role of the family farmer in agricultural and in rural development policy . #% This is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life . #% Wherever you find him or her , may God direct the hands , hearts and heads of the scientific , political and medical communities at this exciting but frightening and bewildering crossroads in time as we test the frontiers of knowledge . #% This will be a great opportunity . #% It is a powerfully significant report for the work of this House because it is about legislative quality control . #% This right needs to be balanced against an individuals right to access to information and , furthermore , sanctions should only be targeted at the larger commercial exploiters of copyright material . #% I have been to that hospital as well , and when I was there they had to remove a cat from one of the babies ' cots when we were doing the tour in the outer part of that hospital . #% There is sufficient evidence to warrant a whole re-think on the health implications of these masts . #% I welcome , in particular , the more long-term budgetary assurances to 2013 but feel that the 1 % inflation provision should at least be index-linked . #% There were some good things in it , on enlargement and sustainability ; but in relation to defence policy , I just could not accept the idea of welcoming the rapid reaction force and wanting it to be operational before the end of 2001 . #% Where we have measures in place to try to encourage young people into farming , we must ensure that they are sufficient to do just that . #% Mr President , I want to express my appreciation of the way the Commission brought this proposal forward . #% Who influenced you ? #% Between 1983 and 1993 25 regions with the lowest unemployment rate managed to improve from 4.8 % to 4.6 % but the picture for the 25 worst regions was more devastating with an increase of 17.2 % to 22.4 % . #% As you said yourself , you do not want to propose alternatives because you do not want the Irish people to ask what those alternatives are . #% Indeed , in Ireland , we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre . #% Therefore I am delighted that when we look at the fifth framework programme , as we looked at the fourth , we from all those fifteen countries say : ' That is enough . #% Is this the Pauline Green who , in December , recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking ? #% This was clearly demonstrated to us during our visit to the region , and our resolve to continue to encourage an agreement now between Bhutan and Nepal is as strong as ever . #% It was a difficult conference because there were long , tortuous and turgid negotiations but I can not but support Mr Spencer and congratulate the Commission . #% But with the principle of proportionality well respected , proposals to use the structural funds in this regard will help countries like Ireland to focus on what they actually need to do . #% So they are popular and we need to regulate and open up this area for consumers and business . #% I also wish to ask the President-in-Office to deal with the nuclear issue . #% The authority and success of the United Nations peacekeeping units was not based on the strength of their arms but on the moral clout of the UN , and this , in turn , was based on the acceptance by the conflicting parties of the political neutrality of the UN and its genuine wish to secure the peace . #% In the end , OLAF might have the political leverage and power to demand as much money and staff as it wanted . #% The bootleggers are up in arms at this , but now , with the Commissioner announcing his intention to take action against the United Kingdom for creating barriers to the free movement of goods , the door could be opened even wider to give smuggling an even greater field day . #% The Commission , after all , is the custodian of the Community budget . #% However , we should not be thinking of cutting back on farm expenditure and need to avail of the ample margins available to us . #% Nobody is going to be coerced into anything . #% The fact is that under the Brussels II Convention the decisions made in the court in the country where the child normally lives can be implemented in the country where the abducted child is being held . #% 
We must also ensure that , while they are abroad , students continue to receive education grants from their home Member States and that the Erasmus programme is not exclusive to those who can afford it . #% That is not the right way forward . #% There has been an appalling loss of life , the conflict in the region between the Israeli and the Palestinian people has deepened and the hopes of restarting the peace process regrettably have receded . #% As far as labelling goes , I am very disappointed that the Council did not adopt Parliament 's recommendation in the first reading that `` tested on animals '' should be clearly stated on the product label . #% We , however , need to make progress on our priorities . #% Due to our peripheral location and our island status , as Mr Maat has recognised - for which I thank him - we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat , and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms . #% Although there is an emphasis on satellites , we need to realize there are tremendous synergies with manned or , more politically correct , peopled activities , which is essential . #% He cites to me in letters his problems in dealing with the European Patent Office and the litany of hurdles he has to go through to obtain a European patent . #% We will be judged by our citizens on how we handle the challenge of reform . #% Finally , a very brief point on mutual recognition . #% Hopefully the achievement of gender mainstreaming , at least in this programme , will ensure that gender mainstreaming is part of all policies developed by the European Union and the Member States . #% In committee I also queried whether a culture of corruption had spread to the independent quality assurance verification by Lloyd 's Quality Assurance who verify that BNF procedures comply with health and safety requirements . #% Each government within the European Union will also have to set up central contact points , which will provide consumers with the requisite information about out-of-court resolution disputes bodies which are operational within their jurisdiction . #% Violence may be an outlet for frustration , but it can only worsen an already bad situation and will not solve the problems which lie at its root . #% When we look at the overall strategy a number of things jump out - colleagues on the other side of the House may disagree with this interpretation , but this is my opinion . #% It is time to focus on the humanitarian needs of this long-suffering people and on the reconstruction of this beautiful country . #% We also need to tackle very seriously the brokers of arms . #% Could you outline when people will know whether their area will receive less , or more , funding under the reclassification ? #% I believe that as far as international agreements are concerned , if there are significant amounts of money involved then Parliament is entitled , under Article 228 of the Maastricht Treaty , to full assent procedures . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and would like to give him some information of which he may not be aware . #% Mr President , Mr President-in-Office and Mr President , I am very pleased that the Taoiseach and his ministers are here today and that they hold the presidency of Europe at this particularly crucial time . #% Nuclear energy is not sustainable and we need an intense debate on this in Parliament and with the Commission in the process of evaluating this technology . #% That is very important as well as for some specific areas such as information technology and others where there are very clear societal implications . #% We have the Member States going one way , we have the Commission going another way , we have scientists telling us another thing and in the middle we have fishermen and the fishing industry wondering what way they can go . #% For that reason - regretfully , because I would have done anything to defeat Dr Rath 's purpose - I voted for the amendments which , unfortunately , were not passed . #% I do not want my life regulated to that extent . #% Could you please detail any amendments you are proposing in the directive before the second period of NAPs ? #% It means being conservative when one decides the level at which one wants to maintain a fish stock . #% Foolish reports like this do more to assist euroscepticism than anything else I can think of . #% Delaying enlargement would have a very negative effect on the development of the Union . #% Over-regulation stifles initiative and , therefore , progress and prosperity . #% They can not afford not to work ; they need the two salaries to pay the mortgage . #% I also support the provisions in Mr Souchet ' s report which states that we must ensure respect for the European agriculture and food production model . #% The car industry states that the framework allows it to move forward more quickly , that a directive will slow down implementation . #% Madam President , I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report incorporating equal opportunities for women and men in all Community policies and activities . #% We accept the importance of a debate in Parliament on food safety but the proposal made was for an urgent debate on the question of whether a Member State has the right to decide for itself in accordance not with Community policy but with what suits its own political aspirations at a particular time . #% Established in 1994 , the agreement permits Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU 's single market without conventional EU membership . #% I must stress again the need for rapid action on these issues . #% For example , from an Irish perspective , Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel . #% The status quo is no longer an option . #% in writing . - This proposal aims at ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic , environmental and social conditions . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur . #% Finally , let us not forget that the Lisbon Agenda is about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2015 . #% I refer in particular to the concern about the very sensitive sugar beet issue . #% Is that still your position , and what difference do you think that would make in terms of price differentials ? #% It amazes me that we can write a whole strategy without ever mentioning the words ` spirit ' or ` spirituality ' . #% I know this is a very sensitive and divisive issue in Malta as indeed it is in other Member States including Ireland . #% In fact , the last six months have been testament to the fact that the smaller countries in Europe can run an effective and focused presidency of the European Union . #% Though TB in its human form has been contained in most EU countries since the middle of the 20th century , it continues to spread aggressively among livestock and affects 5 % of cattle herds in my Ireland East constituency each year . #% The Chief Inspector recommended that the high-level waste tanks and the serious risk resulting from the inability of BNFL to make them passively safe through vitrification was an urgent issue . #% I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term . #% The international coalition - particularly the United States and not least its President - has assumed that the Northern Alliance is in some ways biddable , that it will do certain things and not others . #% Secondly , in relation to what has happened in Ireland this weekend , it is only proper that we should have a debate on this . #% The protocol of the fisheries agreement between the Union and Equatorial Guinea expired at the end of last June . #% Why is the family looking for justice here ? #% We can not protect people from themselves , nor should we legislate for all life 's risks . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by thanking the members of Committee on Budgetary Control for their kind cooperation with me in preparation of this report , both individually and by group . #% So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if , in fact , the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas ? #% We are therefore opposed to any kind of political or economic pressure being brought to bear on Morocco in order to encourage it or to coerce it to sign an agreement with the European Union . #% There are also some serious questions relating to planning because some of the afforestation is also unsightly . #% However , if I may be so bold , I would like to touch on two or three elements . #% Now we are in the process of voting through a system that will provide confidence to consumers on a product-by-product basis , with nutritional and health claims based on scientific evidence . #% It is now high time that our policies assisted that agriculture . #% I did not know how that decision was made . #% Marking symbols used on packaging to indicate in which category the waste belongs must not only be clear and easily understood but must use the same marking symbols and same colours right across the EU . #% There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament . #% 
Since 2001 , EU fishermen have removed hundreds of tonnes of rubbish from our seas and returned it to land where it is collected and disposed of responsibly . #% I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions , not just between Commission and Parliament , but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge . #% EU-wide experiences of the use of biomass for producing energy , involving both renewable raw materials and organic farm waste , should be pooled so that the most viable initiatives can be replicated across Europe . #% The report by Vaclav Havel and Desmond Tutu makes a real , legal and valid case for bringing the Burma issue to the UN Security Council , and I support it . #% They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience . #% I have several questions to the Council in the time permitted to me . #% Might I remind this House that after the Second World War we from the countries of Western Europe allowed Polish soldiers from German prisoner-of-war camps to be returned and fed to Stalin , who consumed them instantly , or slowly in Siberian gulags . #% It is 49 pages covering 593 different initiatives . #% This is basically cosmetics - things to boost people 's egos , making a huge amount of money for the industry . #% I wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of Europe . #% Think of the real infrastructural change this vast volume of money could have made if spent internally on the real needs of the UK since 1973 . #% It is a completely separate issue and it is unacceptable . #% In this I am convinced that the EU must take the initiative . #% People who did not own property were living in ravines and on the sides of mountains , in shacks and in any thing they could put together , because they did not own the property in which they were living . #% That is the issue I invite the Commissioner to address when he replies in this debate . #% This figure must increase to at least USD 10 billion a year if we are to combat the disease effectively . #% Our Member States - and we have some influence there - should start removing some of those barriers . #% As a mother , I believe that robbing children of their innocence is a crime . #% The one thing I now see clearly is that there are no real level playing fields in agricultural production , be this organic or conventional , and I firmly believe you can only achieve this from the centre and with positive encouragement . #% I believe it is very important that we all work together in a spirit of cooperation so as to ensure that the problems of social exclusion are solved within our community . #% So what has gone wrong ? #% It is a disgrace that in Ireland we are still waiting for the rollout of a national breast screening programme . #% Mr President , tourism in any region should be a positive contributor to economic growth and stability . #% That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market that fluctuated from EUR 31 per tonne down to EUR 8 per tonne and back up to EUR 16 per tonne . #% The judicial authorities in the United Kingdom and Spain have to go through the correct processes . #% There appears to be a total lack of understanding there of what postal services are all about . #% There seems to be some difficulty with the running order of speakers in the House after the changes that have taken place in the size of groups today . #% I support the idea of concerted actions between the Commission , the Member States and other partners in the field of education to examine national experiences and to promote best practice regarding the use of eLearning and fighting the digital divide . #% I oppose the war and I continue to oppose its outcome and the direction which Iraq is taking at the present time . #% We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer . #% The President of Guyana actually said that they would receive EUR 8 million in debt relief because of the fantastic initiative undertaken by yourself and your government as leaders of the G8 with regard to alleviating debt in Africa and it would cost them GBP 44 million to try and comply with the reforms that would be put forward . #% That sense of abandonment has led to the apathy and indifference as demonstrated by the lower turnout in recent European elections and , in Ireland 's case , rejection of the Nice Treaty . #% in writing . - I have spoken on this issue before and I am voting for this report because I believe EU citizens have the right to know the make-up of the clothes they buy . #% Let us make no mistake about that . #% In this regard , one suggestion is that we contemplate the establishment of a political and security committee and military committee . #% I am aware of the fact , for instance , that teachers in Ireland have acquired skills at their own expense . #% He is serious about making a difference in combating trafficking , and that needs to be recognised . #% Only incineration with high standards of energy efficiency will be defined as recovery . #% I would like to know if possible from the Commissioner what action he has taken to deal with this possible conflict in the future . #% Some other children disappear because they have had fatal accidents and they are never found either . #% I fully support the idea of EU assistance to the business sector in developing countries through intermediaries . #% So I appeal to the Commissioner to avoid the ignominy of being brought before the European Court of Justice by this House for failing to comply with the Treaties . #% After many exhaustive weeks of informatory preparatory work and meetings , the Conciliation Committee reached agreement on a joint text for the regulation concerning certain fluorinated greenhouse gases -- f-gases -- on 31 January 2006 , which addressed the main points of disagreement between Parliament and the Council , which are namely : the possibility for the Member States to keep or introduce national measures stricter than those foreseen by the regulation ; technical provisions regarding f-gas containment ; reporting and review of the regulation ; definition of placing on the market ; cross-border transport or shipment of f-gases for recovery ; labelling ; notification of measures introducing further bans on f-gases ; and the area of training and certification . #% But this , too , must add a new urgency for the Council and the Commission in respect of an EU-led political initiative to resolve the Cyprus problem under the aegis of the United Nations lest , again , we should institutionalise inside the Union an intractable and difficult problem on that divided island . #% The emphasis is on helping people to assert their rights and to understand to participate fully in the democratic process . #% In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection , and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment . #% This is a tight timeframe , but one which can now be achieved because of the strong progress which has been made over the last six months . #% They have been denied justice by the UK , Irish and EU authorities though they are entitled to redress and protection when regulators fail . #% I know that Commissioners often say that Parliament does not take its role seriously . #% We cover the energy programmes , those relating to industry , including small and medium firms , the research programmes under the framework programmes which of course amount to more or less 60 % of the internal policy expenditure of the European Union , and the trade and technical assistance lines . #% I very much regret that Parliament is not being asked to vote directly on the contents of the treaty but instead , is being asked to consider the merits of a lengthy opinion from the Committee on Institutional Affairs . #% We want you , Commissioner , to take action in this area . #% The current negotiations on a revision of the European Treaties are taking place in parallel with the preparation of the creation of a single currency . #% Mr President , the only issue left to address at this stage , given the broad range of contributions from all sides of this House , is why we are surprised about what has happened in Indonesia , why we are surprised at the impotent response of the European Union to the tragic genocide of the last two weeks in East Timor . #% Are we seriously saying that here in Europe we value our inventiveness less than those countries new to innovation and inventions ? #% Respecting the right of individual Member States , would the Council not coordinate a policy which grants visa-free access , which , in my view , is the total implementation of the concept of one country , two systems ? #% EU leaders want to promote more and better jobs and worker mobility , anticipate and manage change in the working environment , combat poverty , exclusion and discrimination , modernise social protection systems and promote equality . #% I should be quite happy with observer status without speaking rights . #% Mr Patten has just recommended what could be called a terrorist charter for Northern Ireland . #% In most countries the milk gave a higher economic return than , for example , breeding beef - certainly that was the experience in Ireland and the UK . #% However , my major concern arises because of the existence of a strong eurosceptic core at the heart of the Irish government . #% It may be the last opportunity I have to do this in this House . #% On 22 April the Competition Council will be meeting behind closed doors to decide on the future of the Services Directive , a directive in which millions of European citizens have taken an active role and active interest . #% In the future it is likely that more and more animal feed will be derived from GM crops . #% To remain competitive , we must ensure that the benefits of new technologies are spread to all European regions . #% As my colleague , Mr Andersson , rightly pointed out , there is not just one single model , but a variety of different ones . #% 
This modern apocalypse is America ' s injury , but the wounds are universally shared among the community of democratic nations . #% Did you actually read our report ? #% Likewise I am opposed to the Home State Taxation scheme for SMEs . #% I am not going to apologize , I want to put on record ... #% Some Members of this House took a ridiculous approach in saying I should be recommending that people eat more oranges and vegetables . #% For myself , I want a complete list of ingredients and a mention of any nutrient-damaging process like irradiation , bleaching , saturation etc. to which the ingredients were exposed . #% With regard to the recently introduced deregulation in the United Kingdom , does the Commissioner have any plans to monitor that , or any comments to make upon it ? #% I will examine the matter further when I have received that report and I will ensure that the relevant Council minister receives a copy of the report . #% If I choose to spend 10 hours on a beach on Saturday or Sunday , or 10 hours in the garden at 80 degrees exposed to the sun , or on the golf course in very hot sunshine , all the health authorities would say that it was far too long . #% Foremost amongst these basic structures was , and still is , the principle that each country should have representation at decision-making level in all the major institutions . #% It is essential that we find a means of ensuring the reality of free movement of goods throughout the EU without prejudice to those who earn their living from inter-Community trade . #% It would be wrong , however , to deprive agriculture of the benefits of modern research . #% This is not a matter of passengers paying for the privilege of safety ( this is no privilege but a given right ) , it is a matter of states keeping aeroplanes from crashing into populated areas on the ground . #% Such events , thankfully are rare , as producers are reasonable people and their total livelihood and profit depend on the animals under their care being in good condition at the end of their journey . #% More land will become available for alternative use as a result of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy . #% Also , all progress towards introduction of a CO2 tax has failed in Council . #% Secondly , there are various considerations regarding the different directives which have gone through Parliament , the Council and Commission in the recent past with regard to design and models ; some thought might also be given to standardizing safety features within the automobile sector to ensure they are made available , not necessarily as extras but also as part of the normal construction of automobiles to guarantee the safety not only of the drivers but also of the passengers and pedestrians . #% It is not as binding or as transparent as legislation , and there is a real lack of confidence expressed by the pedestrian protection bodies . #% Likewise , we as legislators demand full respect from all sections and services within the Commission for our role . #% As previous speakers on this issue have indicated , the individual Member States have not implemented the criteria properly . #% We must appeal to the better instincts of our peoples , to bear in mind that what we are trying to create is a Europe based on human values . #% In this way we can only add to the democratic legitimacy of the reform process . #% Please give the Irish people the tools ; we will do the job ourselves , but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying . #% Mr President , I am delighted to be the first man to speak in this debate on International Women 's Day . #% I would strongly urge the Commission to consider it favourably as we now live in a global network with a global economy , global companies . #% I have also come across and been approached by constituents about a situation where special offers are offered , for example in the UK , which are not available to somebody coming , for example , from Ireland to pick up the tour in the UK . #% For these and many other reasons I voted against the report . #% It is an awful pity that Parliament , the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland . #% All these aspects will come to the fore even more in the coming years through the recently-reformed common agricultural policy . #% Mr President , this debate again confirms Parliament 's commitment to public health and indeed to environmental issues as well , and I welcome the opportunity to make a brief intervention . #% Equally , we must have redress for the consumer and sanctions if these alternative regulations fail to deliver benefits for the consumer in the internal market . #% But I wish to point out that there already has been discussion of the increased importance of regionalism within the World Trade Organization . #% If not , thousands of workers will be added to our shameful statistics . #% In Agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development . #% in writing . - I welcome this report as an important step forward in the battle against dementia . #% With certain necessary changes , we have almost got it right . #% He has not gone back and told fishermen around the Irish Sea that the European Commission is trying to persecute them or to do them an injustice . #% Over the years , funds that flowed from the cohesion and structural funds and were intended for regions such as mine were channelled to Dublin , the east and the south of the country and co-financed national development plans . #% That is exactly what this debate on the Green Paper can do : ensure that we open up this whole area , focus on the major problems of stigma and discrimination and exchange best practice and epidemiological figures on this area . #% We need to see that there are no hidden subsidies in EU countries that hamper fair competition between shipbuilding countries . #% The EU 's abandonment of sanctions in 2005 has been an utter failure . #% It is better to rely on cooperation ; the carrot works a lot better than the stick . #% Regionalisation does not mean renationalisation or moving away from a Community model ; it means giving communities which are bordering each other and are fishing similar species the opportunity to come together to manage those species . #% The new guidelines confuse it with low-dispersal material . #% Mr President , it is imperative , when the new euro currency and the euro rate come into existence in January 1999 and when the green pound is abolished , that farmers do not lose out in terms of the value of their income supports under the common agricultural policy . #% This is of particular importance in my region in the north west of Ireland . #% The motorway , as currently planned , will bury this site before an archaeological dig has been carried out . #% The women of the McCartney family -- Paula , Catherine , Donna , Gemma , Clare and Bridgeen -- who are ordinary women in every aspect of their lives , have done something extraordinary . #% I would point out the importance to Parliament of Amendment No 29 and its counterpart in the Euratom programme , Amendment No 38 , which add criteria which can and should be taken into account , including activities to increase the role of women in research and to look at synergies with education . #% I believe that this is a direction in which we must go but I would also like to make one additional point . #% Will LEADER retain its identity and independence as a Community initiative with a high level of voluntary Community participation ? #% Parliament was represented , I was present , and I think you struck exactly the right note for Parliament . #% We have heard about promoting the consumption of fish as a healthy food to support the fishing industry . #% There are no double damages . #% I am interested in seeing whether we have met those targets . #% The challenges facing the European Union are too great for institutional deadlock to hamper the Commission and the European Parliament in dealing with their legislative programme . #% I should like to know why an exhibition by a lesbian artist was banned from this Parliament . #% I wish to emphasise that the German Government should approach the issues of the reform of the common agricultural policy and the reform of the Structural Funds as well as the future financing arrangements of the Union in a balanced and even-handed manner . #% It is essential that subsidiarity prevail and that each Member State be free to decide which medicines will require prescriptions . #% Are we willing to accept a free-for-all approach to the use of angel dust and other suspicious substances amongst Brazilian beef farmers ? #% In relation to CMR substances , which are allowed in cosmetics , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy reaffirmed its first reading request to ban CMRs in cosmetics unless evaluated and accepted as safe by the Scientific Committee . #% Mr President , ba mhaith liomsa i dtosac céad míle fáilte a chuir roimh Aire Gnóthai Eachtracha na hEireann chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa i maidin . #% We must retain production and processing capacity to face these future challenges . #% I am also here in the absence of Mr John Bowis , our coordinator , and would like to include my contribution on behalf of the PPE-DE Group while I am on my feet , rather than speaking again after the Commissioner . #% The struggle against dictatorship must be linked to the struggle for genuine socialist change in China , whereby the vast wealth and resources in China are taken into democratic public ownership and the economy is democratically planned to raise the living standards of ordinary people . #% I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the decision to close the last sugar factory in Ireland . #% 
Needless to say the EU governments negotiating this new Treaty have individual concerns and reservations relating to certain aspects of that Treaty . #% Because this is an automatic mechanism , and if we have surpluses in the Community and a policy designed to get them out of the Community to sell them to markets where prices are lower , then it is obvious from day to day and month to month as world markets change that we need an order to get these surpluses out of the Union . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% A straightforward redistribution of the existing resources from the structural funds and the common agricultural policy will result in the Union 's agricultural regions taking on a disproportionately large share of the cost of enlargement . #% Countries - particularly Belgium - are in breach of human rights standards . #% But it is equally important to bring the governments of the Member States along with us , because , as has been seen from the use of Article 235 , certain governments felt this was an imposition on them , and that it interfered with their democratic rights under the rules of subsidiarity within the Treaties . #% The propaganda we have heard , which is completely simplistic and totally inaccurate , does nothing to help the debate , wastes the money of those who are trying to promote the opposite approach , and will not work . #% On the other hand , it has to be questionable whether a nine-hour cap on the transport of animals is legally possible in the single market . #% I shall answer the first myself : will world trade -- free trade -- deliver sufficient global food supply ? #% There remains the issue of the 'em pty Annexes ' . #% Returning to your reaction , not only does your response betray the EU/EOM , it is a betrayal of the interests of the people of Pakistan , especially those who are courageously working for the restoration of democracy . #% Mr President-in-Office , the work you and your government have done , and are still doing , for peace in Northern Ireland is outstanding . #% From the outset we have considered that `` mad cow disease '' is a Community problem and should therefore be fully financed by the Community . #% . Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder for the very collegiate and cooperative way in which he has worked with other committees , and Mrs Gill for the same reason . #% The proposals of the Commission are a significant step along the path towards a more responsible approach to fishing activities . #% It also constitutes an improvement as regards strengthening the equal treatment of all EU nationals . #% I can point to three individual small firms from Ireland that went into liquidation because of the late payment by the Commission for contracts those firms completed in Russia . #% With the advent of broadband , the Internet is on all the time . #% If the EU Council Summit at Laeken this weekend only addresses the issue of the strengthening of borders as a response to this modern day slave trade , it will have failed not only to respect these values but also to fulfil its leadership role . #% They must take it on the head for failing to defend their products . #% It is also clear that Sweden and Denmark will accede to the single European currency regime over the next couple of years . #% If we do not have the money , we can not undertake the actions and policies we want . #% This directive would have had no effect on the acquis communautaire of employment rights in the EU , or in the national Member States . #% Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people , those involved in Morocco . #% While the government in Khartoum claims to keep peace agreements , which we know it does not , it funds the LRA -- the Lord 's Resistance Army -- from northern Uganda to continue the genocide for them . #% It is not equal treatment when there is such a huge difference in the proportion of funding received by one organisation as compared to that granted to other women 's organisations . #% Mr President , Strasbourg is a beautiful and historic city but , for those of us living some distance away , it is extremely difficult to access . #% In the past few years he has rescued many children and has set up the orphanage in Olongapo City in the Philippines . #% We have to do everything to ensure that this woman 's sentence is commuted and that there is a stay of her execution . #% The European Union with its internal market and free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is a positive economic prospect for a country which is seeking to find more markets for its domestic manufactured goods . #% Commissioner , you can not control what is on the web , but you can control access in the following way . #% It is also essential that an agreement should be negotiated and signed between the European Union and the United States , stipulating that each party should observe the provisions governing protection of the privacy of citizens and the confidentiality of business communications . #% Therefore , road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive , and , if anybody believes that they are not , then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive . #% Unfortunately , the Commission action plan does not go far enough in this direction . #% The only merciful thing was that neither her husband nor her children were in the car when it blew up savagely within sight and sound of her own home and the school where her little daughter was playing in the playground . #% Mr President , most people speaking here today talk about how ` the precautionary principle must be respected , but ... ' . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he intends to place this on the agenda and make it clear to the Israeli Government that the Association Agreement can be suspended and that even tougher action , such as a trade embargo , could be put in place if this kind of activity does not stop . #% It is high time we looked at those issues . #% I hope this report puts the citizens at the heart of the Single Market and strengthens its social dimension . #% Now , a major challenge for the future is to disarm Hizbollah . #% I welcome the Commissioner to the House also , because eventually the Commission will have to start implementing some of the things that we are talking about here . #% It is about their way of life , the only one possible in many areas . #% I welcome this joint resolution and , as mentioned in paragraph 16 , the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries . #% It is important that this Parliament recognises that over the last year and a half , tremendous progress has been made in Turkey and this should not be forgotten . #% There is one big lesson to be learned from this fund operating together with the Delors package : this is that small amounts of money can very often have a bigger political impact than the investment would suggest . #% The forces based in Iraq are sadly contending with daily acts of sabotage and loss of life . #% At the end of this year , the Commission is going to present its proposals for the next generation of financing instruments for external action , to cover the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework . #% Gas is increasingly becoming a more popular form of energy used in both residential and commercial set-ups . #% It is incumbent on the Commission and all the 15 governments of the Union also to reflect upon this result . #% Mr President , at the part-session here last month I raised this very question of the problems of flying to Strasbourg . #% Parliament itself can not rid itself of part of the blame for this . #% As regards the Irish presidency , the programme of the Irish presidency states that , on security and disarmament , it will pursue the continuing and effective development of EU/WEU cooperation on the basis of the Treaty on European Union in cooperation with the Belgian WEU presidency . #% As rapporteur , I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen . #% A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved . #% I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later . #% Everybody is entitled to their democratic point of view , but certainly it was intimidatory to both Members and guests , hundreds of whom were trying to get into to Parliament at the same time . #% I welcome the fact that in the reports there is a role for Europol and Eurojust as well as between the Member States . #% The whole point of national allocation plans is to ensure that the EU emissions trading schemes deliver the best possible benefits for the climate . #% I find it astonishing , given that Ireland depends so much on technology for its economic development and growth , that this area is so badly funded and so badly addressed in current educational policy in Ireland . #% Multilateral environment agreements can not be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules . #% I have to say at the outset that this is not necessarily a major problem for what we would term the ` major airlines ' , that is , airlines such as Lufthansa , Air France , British Airways and the other big boys . #% On the other hand , we must be careful that the arrival of new members is not detrimental to the future workings of the Treaties . #% I hope that in the very near future - possibly in the autumn - the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy will take an initiative and we will have a much more comprehensive report to deal with the many concerns which this House and indeed I myself , as rapporteur , have relating to Hong Kong . #% I would like to focus on one of the points in the Lipietz report -- the possible abolition of the 1 and 2 cent coins . #% That has happened in this case . #% We have raised standards of food production ; we have environmental and animal welfare issues . #% 
I believe this clarifies where different countries stand . #% It is my view that if the industry in Europe abides by a binding code of conduct and the only arms being traded are legitimate and consistent with that code , it is then inappropriate to burden the industry with an extra tax . #% It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States . #% Clearly Europe has a role to play in laying down and enforcing strict norms on water quality . #% I support the enlargement of the European Union . #% - I would like to first congratulate those who have drafted and voted on Directive 98/44/EC which is a step forward in the protection of the human being . #% Greater involvement of the ACP national parliaments and civil society - through financial and technical support - is needed in order to enhance the ACP-EU cooperation . #% Can we trust them ? #% Let us be clear about one thing . #% You can give the leadership but that leadership requires compromise and consensus . #% If the Member puts down a question in relation to this particular article I will attempt to answer it . #% We talk about the two pillars of the CAP -- agriculture and rural development . #% Madam President , as regards fishing in international waters we need a responsible and non-exploitative approach . #% Are we in a position to respond to the needs of the industry and respond in time ? #% When European farmers demonstrate in the streets about the common agricultural policy , it is not because they are against the policy but because they fear that they may be deprived of it . #% I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the fullness and openness of his reporting to Parliament . #% The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has recently stated that it has become more difficult to obtain information on Sellafield from the British authorities over the past couple of years . #% I also thank the European office dealing with human rights in Nigeria . #% His report is based on a resolution that I tabled . #% We can learn from the experience of the United States and avoid disastrous mistakes such as the Enron affair . #% They have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal , primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort : the very thing that is most needed . #% Since that awful incident , the bodies of four dead Romanians have been found inside a container bound for Canada in the Italian port of Livorno . #% A 2007 European survey indicates that the majority of EU citizens feel that public authorities have not done an adequate job of informing them on ways to protect themselves from EMFs . #% In conclusion , may I once again thank Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and the Commission . #% The new guidelines appear to be designed specifically to accommodate the air transport of MOX fuel . #% But I can say that there is regular dialogue with these states and the European Union . #% Because my constituent , Michael Shields , is serving a ten-year sentence for a violent attack of which he continues to maintain he is innocent . #% Madam President , I fear that I must say something that might upset some Members , but the ushers outside are afraid - and I use the word advisedly - to ask some Members to stop smoking , because of the kind of abuse they get when they try to do that . #% Mr President , there are occasions when words are meaningless and when failure to act undermines the credibility of what we say . #% The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union 's proposal . #% It should also be pointed out that the Socrates programme has already been extended to cover the period 2000 to 2006 and EUR 1 850 million has been allocated for this programme . #% Due to the ever-changing nature of this field , we need to re-evaluate the regulations protecting our citizens . #% Important amendments relating to gender equality in the selection of workers ' representatives , trade union rights and corporate social responsibility have been adopted in committee and I am pleased to hear that there are indications that both the Commission and the Council are favourably disposed towards many of them . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Ebner for a very comprehensive and stimulating report . #% May I first of all acknowledge the value and potential of Socrates and in so doing thank the rapporteur for her work . #% If we are serious about bringing Europe closer to the public , to Europe 's citizens , then this is the kind of debate we need to make public in the Council . #% We particularly oppose the adoption of the directive under which Member States may , inter alia , adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period . #% The situation is grim and it is urgent . #% Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils , which will have an extremely important role to play . #% I firmly believe that the vast majority of the Irish people are committed to the enlargement process and I do not want to see the timeframe for the enlargement of the European Union to include countries from Eastern and Central Europe delayed as a direct consequence of the decision of the Irish people last week . #% Billions of people live under the threat of persecution . #% We are allocating at least 1 % of GDP annually to build up the pension reserve fund so as to provide for our ageing population . #% The agriculture industry certainly does not need anymore bad publicity and I support Mr Stevenson 's position on the amendments put forward by Mr Mulder . #% Given this fact , it is regrettable that he was subsequently elected as Prime Minster of Israel , this being the root of many of the current problems . #% They have taken a lot of stick and have been hurt unnecessarily in many ways . #% We set the framework at European level and , as time goes on , there will be an evening up . #% Above all , let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists . #% Has the negotiating mandate set out in the Council conclusions and the Luxembourg Agreement changed ? #% The President-in-Office has an onerous burden : to make progress in these areas under the shadow of what is , perhaps , the last remaining and most intractable political conflict in Europe is , indeed , a very heavy burden to bear . #% But it is a matter where circumstances may change . #% I would like to address two points here . #% To those colleagues who are seeking to eliminate export refunds for live cattle , I would ask them again to consider the trade implications of what they are suggesting . #% Members have mentioned the question of comitology . #% As I have said in previous debates , farmers are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and those responsible for the manufacture of animal feed which puts public health , our entire livestock sector and indeed farm incomes at risk , have much to answer for . #% One proposal which I oppose - and we have asked for a separate vote - is on the question of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office . #% However , taxpayers want to see better value for money . #% One could almost call it an outrage , in fact , given the hundreds of thousands of EU citizens - most of them very young people - whose lives are being completely destroyed by the drug barons who make themselves vast fortunes , assisted very often by inadequate company legislation . #% To conclude , it is imperative that we , at European level , address ourselves towards ensuring a future for European agriculture . #% Then they can be properly liberated . #% I also hope we can move away from the adversarial approach on environmental issues between environmental groups and key business communities . #% The present agrimonetary system in Europe is a very complex regime mainly as a result of the dual rate , whereby expenditures increase due to CAP conversion rates which are higher at times than market values . #% There is more to do . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report on the grounds that such moves are important to reaffirm European solidarity at a time when it is being severely put to the test . #% It is particularly important to insist on the application of directives which come under a Commission remit other than the internal market . #% We must have joined-up thinking , and there must be references in this directive to those areas which may be covered by other directives but which must also be mentioned here . #% Mr President , I also come from an island which had suffered almost 30 years of terrorism . #% 
In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State . #% Without a doubt computer-implemented inventions - genuine inventions which , in some cases , are the result of 10 to 15 years ' R&D investment - are important for the European economy . #% Ireland is a member of the ILO and yet the Irish constitution , as interpreted by our courts , gives employers the right to refuse to recognize unions . #% As a result , many moderate-thinking Muslims see certain efforts being made to combat terrorism as adding to the problem and fuelling fundamentalist thinking , rather than providing an effective solution . #% Thirdly , the EU leaders in Brussels on 24 October 2002 endorsed the findings of the European Commission that 10 countries fulfil the necessary political and economic criteria to assume membership of the EU by 2004 . #% Mr President , I should like to express concern at the Commission emphasis on large integration projects , which would impact badly on small community-based enterprises as promoted within the framework of rural development programmes and research in the agricultural and associated food sector . #% I welcome the inclusion of PFOA - perfluorooctanic acid - in the scope of this directive . #% That is why , with the backing of many of the children ' s organisations across the European Union , we are calling for a number of actions . #% The Daphne programme has been an important instrument in helping to raise awareness of and to combat violence against women , children and young people . #% It is important to bear them in mind and we should move on with this proposal . #% The logging industry in these countries is implicated in corruption and in the exploitation of workers and the deforestation involved is a huge threat to the livelihoods of the indigenous people . #% Firstly , there are various pieces of national legislation which already protect workers and this is merely duplicating or replicating what is already in place . #% We will pass a resolution confirming the appointment of the president later today on these terms . #% It contained an element of exclusivity so that if a family could not afford to support a student studying in a foreign country that student could not benefit . #% Despite the prevalence of this work in all Member States , statistical evaluations of ` labour forces ' rarely take this into account , leaving it under-analysed , ill appreciated and unrecognised . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , as PPE-DE Group members will know , I recommended that we reject this amendment because I felt it was too prescriptive . #% The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously , especially in the oil and gas industry , while 90 % of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country . #% There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq . #% Mr President , I shall be brief . #% Today , I have to tell you , Commissioner , that I find you are totally out of touch with people . #% Supermarkets present their hurdles when it comes to a fair deal for farmers . #% As a Member of the European Parliament , representing Leinster , which is along the Irish Sea , I am deeply concerned at these revelations . #% However , this debate is about labelling . #% But it is clear that in some European countries horses are produced for human consumption - in the Benelux countries , France and Italy , there is quite a large consumption of horsemeat - and we have to take this into account . #% Many colleagues will be aware of the excellent work carried out by the Bureau in promoting protection for lesser used and minority languages . #% I would ask the rapporteur , if possible , to take on board an idea which I put forward in this House two years ago and am still trying to get support for , which is a charter of carers ' rights . #% To its credit , the Commission has proposed a far more comprehensive and important cut in fleet capacity than the Council was ever able to accept . #% What are the options for implementation ? #% Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans . #% There can be no excuse for any government to apply the rule of law in a purely partisan way . #% Much of the funding will be directed towards major cross-border projects , but I do not believe that this can be effective without all countries concerned signing binding bilateral agreements . #% President Prodi has talked about the indispensable necessity of the institutional triangle : the Commission , Parliament and Council . #% At an informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers on 10-12 July in Dublin the general issue of social protection and long-term unemployment was discussed with particular reference to making social protection systems more effective in helping the most disadvantaged members of society to gain access to employment . #% Unfortunately , as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy , we can but mourn the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him . #% This keeps the prices of passenger cars and all road vehicles amongst the most expensive in the EU , including imports of used cars . #% Madam President , for too long the European Union has had its hands tied when it comes to fighting organised crime . #% It is also an investment in the future for a greater understanding of the diversity in the European Union - cultural , social and linguistic . #% The proposal extends the scope of existing Directives 70/156/EEC and 80/1268 as regards the measurement of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption . #% The atmosphere here today is muted , but that must not disguise the fact that the European Union does have a lead role to play in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people will be fully addressed . #% It only sets out basic obligations and general principles . #% Animals should not be transported for long periods where at all possible , and the standards and the quality of lorries must be monitored very closely , especially the ventilation . #% As Commissioner Prodi has said , all European institutions need to step up their commitment to simplify regulations in order to reduce the cost of doing business in Europe and increase legal certainty for citizens . #% The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination . #% However , it also points to the fact that some Member States are more advanced than others , I believe we should also now focus on the new opportunities and new technologies available to us . #% Commissioner , you have not given any guarantee that you would support this policy . #% I want to ask him about that flexibility and the mandate he has from the Council of Ministers with regard to trade concessions in agriculture . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents . #% There is massive repression of journalists and campaigners for justice , for communities and for workers . #% That is why I voted against the Rothley report . #% The confidence and trust of citizens , consumers and business in the EU itself is linked to their experience and perception of EU laws and the impact they have on their daily lives . #% At least ECU 225m are currently being spend in the EU on nuclear research . #% In my own country the government failed to take recommendations and even directives seriously and implement them in a way that actually achieves their original aim . #% author . - Mr President , in the brutal war of the Sri Lanka Government against the Tamil minority , at least 40 000 Tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps . #% We have avoided it for very good reasons for many years . #% That is a failure on the part of our institutions and it is a failure on our own part as politicians . #% The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers . #% I believe it is right and just that the accession countries should have a decisive say in when they feel they can reasonably implement this directive , remembering that they have to face the implementation of so many directives and regulations in the . #% We have to clean up our own house without transferring our problems to those who are economically worse off than ourselves and who are desperate for any money they can get . #% Much of the debate here yesterday focused on the Irish people 's decision in relation to the Nice Treaty . #% However , on this issue we would find very little to differ on , and I welcome his comments here this evening . #% It is unacceptable that these animals are raced to death in places such as Spain and kept in appalling conditions . #% We must ensure that throughout all of those public prosecutors ' offices there is the necessary understanding of what the European Union 's financial interests are . #% As the Commissioner has said , they involve over 120 different countries . #% Neither should we forget that the failure rate and job losses in so-called large industry is much greater . #% It is vitally important that this trend is reversed and that we accelerate the progress of the peace negotiations . #% Every year in the United States , with a population less than the European Union , they deal with the disappearance of approximately 367 , 000 children , I repeat 367 , 000 . #% 
I am also particularly pleased that the funds will support accessibility for people with disabilities and will promote integration of the gender perspective . #% Where proper parallel funding has not been made available by a Member State , the Commission 's inspection role and its ability to recover funds need to be strengthened . #% Mr President , could I say directly to Commissioner Nielson that I wrote to you on 18 August expressing my concern about the life and the plight of Father Brendan Forde , the Irish priest whose life is currently under threat in the complex political circumstances that pertain in Colombia . #% Principle number three creates the circumstances in which they can then all work together in their common interests and break down the barriers of the past . #% Jerusalem should not be regarded as an Arab city or a Jewish city , a Christian city or a Muslim city . #% It is not the appropriate strategy for the Members of this House to recommend that we should pass our responsibilities on to the national governments . #% So what should we do in the EU ? #% The purpose of the mid-term review reform is to promote competitiveness while securing the income of farmers in a situation where payments would no longer be coupled to production . #% However many finely-worded resolutions we have , as long as we in the Community fail to get to grips with the issues relating to children in our own community , we do not have a strong voice to raise our concerns about this . #% In speaking with regard to the issue of people with disabilities in Europe , we should always start with the premise that this issue is firstly and foremost a civil and human rights issue . #% My last point is that , in setting up any working groups or expert groups concerning better lawmaking , it is essential to get the practitioners of politics involved -- not just technocrats or parliamentary draftsmen , but politicians themselves who can understand how this must be sold to the public and enforced at a local level . #% First of all , Question Time was put back to 6:30 p.m. , then it was announced on the screen that it would begin at 6:50 p.m. . #% My colleague , Mr McMahon , has already pointed out that because of better health care and because of longevity the number of people over 75 years of age living within the European Union requiring more personal care and attention has risen . #% We require immediate progress in setting up the veterinary agency in Ireland to accurately supervise this work . #% . In the Working Time Report and every work related report , I look to see if the largest work force in Europe , home carers are included . #% In this context Parliament gave a resounding approval to my report on Regional Advisory Councils , or RACs , as they are known . #% This is particularly worrying for European citizens who share a border with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe . #% Shannon Airport has been unreasonably treated in this regard and has been the loser , because it has now been decided by the American authorities not to use the airport for refuelling purposes , at a cost of EUR 10 million to the revenue of that airport . #% These are issues which have to be taken on board . #% The beef ban for Northern Ireland is unjust and should be lifted immediately . #% The United Nations Security Council should also authorise the deployment of UN human rights monitors throughout Iraq . #% Skeletal diseases began to afflict the children and the adult populations too . #% Labelling of all consumer products and in particular all food items , including soft and alcoholic drinks , is essential to give the consumer a clear description of the items concerned . #% I wish to emphasize again what Mr Walter has put into his report . #% So I accept the principle as reasonable , but when fishermen from a particular region go to exploit these resources , in some instances we should consider whether we should rebalance the resources within our own waters . #% The Finns harvest something in the order of 50 million cubic metres annually . #% According to the text of this recommendation , environmental inspections will include : site visits ; verification of self-monitoring by the operators of the controlled installations ; checking the premises , the equipment and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site as well as the records kept by the operators . #% It is , in my view , deplorable that the PPE seek to undermine our joint rapporteurship and negotiations with the German presidency . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner a couple of questions about that . #% We have to factor that into our calculations . #% Finally , I want to congratulate the Commissioner . #% All conflict is about difference , whether it is a matter of race , religion or nationality . #% The suggestion put forward by some Member States that EU spending should be frozen at current levels until 2006 means , in effect , that the richer Member States are seeking to have the cost of enlargement met by the less-developed countries . #% I am pleased we have been able to find a compromise at second reading between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers by working very quickly and in fact by foregoing the normal full procedure for codecision matters . #% Clarification is undoubtedly necessary . #% The report that we are dealing with today identifies a number of key reforms which in the view of the Petitions Committee need to be carried out if we are to ensure the democratic functioning of the European Union . #% I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings . #% I agree with Mrs Wallis that Commissioner Byrne was right to say that he would not accept this , and I hope that Commissioner Vitorino feels the same way , because this would be a disastrous outcome . #% I want also to recognize the efforts of the American President in this . #% Up to now , the only permanent presidency in existence was that of the Commission . #% I think it shows the ability of the European Union and its institutions to come together in matters of common interest - it shows that we can compromise and have debate . #% I have a couple of questions , Commissioner . #% I hope I am not listening to the creation of a convention , which will be a sort of pub with no beer . #% Remember that at the heart of all these issues there is fear , love and all too often , unfortunately , revenge . #% We need a guarantee by the Council and the Commission that ACTA will not necessitate any changes to EU law as far as criminal measures relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights are concerned . #% So much for the IRA 's supposed disciplinary action : it is a farce . #% We know that the British Government has done nothing to implement its obligations under the Ottawa Convention to date . #% With the adoption tomorrow of Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl 's report , the final piece of the puzzle will be in place . #% The ACP countries , which already enjoy preferential access to the EU market , have expressed their concerns that the reforms will hinder and not help their economies . #% . I thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this important matter . #% In light of Commissioner Byrne ' s statements , let us look at the words of the Permanent Working Group of European Junior Doctors : `` Research demonstrates that sustained wakefulness such as that experienced by junior doctors ( working excessive hours ) , reduces performance to a level similar to excessive alcohol consumption . '' #% We should also remember that some Member States , including my country , must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC . #% Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper , so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts . #% This is a pity , because I would like it to strategically plan so as to be able to look at the workers that are not included in the Agency 's vigilance for health and safety . #% If Sinn Féin / IRA succeed in denying criminal justice to this family , then I endorse the call that the EU should help fund an action so that the killers and conspirators can be pursued at least through the civil courts . #% The actual requirement on the European Commission was to bring forward a publication which would show production and investment figures in an indicative programme . #% This problem is evident in countries throughout the EU and therefore requires urgent action . #% Harmonising Member States ' visa policies with regard to third countries is , in my view , essential as a major step towards improving the safety of travel documents . #% This proposal would also involve information centres being set up so as to enable victims to identify appropriate claim representatives . #% Reform is nothing to be ashamed of . #% I would certainly welcome the intensification of the enlargement negotiations between the applicant countries and the European Union . #% Without increased trade activity , global growth will slow down and global poverty will rise . #% As you and the Commissioner have said , they worked in a particularly sensitive political and security environment at great personal risk to themselves . #% Many of these disciplines are extremely profound and have their own practical traditions which are very effective . #% That is what has to be addressed . #% It is important to bear in mind that we can not predict now where the next conflict might arise , the number of people in immediate danger , nor their particular circumstances . #% 
Madam President , I suppose that those of us who have remained can be thankful to Commissioner Bolkestein for being late . #% This matter is relevant to us obviously because of the horrific tragedy involving the loss of these young lives , but also because we have dealt with the use of seatbelts in public transport many times in this House with , I have to say , only limited success . #% I would propose on behalf of colleagues that we have immediate resuscitation equipment here in the Chamber in case such a distressing event occurs again . #% One of the consequences of this judgment is that there will now be an obligation on all Member States to ensure that there is a common system available to give assistance to those students who are in Erasmus programmes or who are studying in full-time programmes in countries other than their own Member States . #% I was not breaking the peace , but trying to keep the peace by helping to rid the world of nuclear weapons . #% These responsibilities lie primarily with the Member States and it is time , as I said , that we assumed our responsibility not only for the health of our population today , but for the protection of our environment for tomorrow 's generations as well . #% That can not be substantiated . #% It is therefore important that any further negotiations or any intent to change difficult compromises are made in as open a forum as possible . #% Unfortunately , for feminist women , the family has become sort of battleground . #% That is why I supported the LEADER initiative both now and in the past and why I support the new EU EQUAL job creation programme . #% A two-speed or a two-tier Europe will not succeed in meeting the aspirations of our peoples . #% In my own country of Ireland , we are still coming to terms with the legacy of British rule and the continuing partition of our country , along with decades of discrimination in the electoral process , in housing , employment and policing . #% In voting through this report and its recommendations , this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism . #% Expansion of this market across borders may develop naturally through subsidiaries or branches abroad on a more widespread basis , if the market is encouraged in other areas . #% If we could move away from thinking in terms of facts and figures , sums and statistics , markets and merchandise ; if we could remember at all times that our policies impact on the real lives of real people , then we would demonstrate a genuine commitment to the fundamental values we claim to cherish . #% I hope that an indication can be given by the Council in time for the appropriate changes to be made in the first reading of the 2000 budget . #% The ball is now in the Commission 's court . #% This policy is a uniform European-wide programme , and forcing national governments to contribute up to 25 % of the agricultural budget would clearly fragment and distort the workings of the CAP . #% That is why we are deeply upset - particularly in my group - about the very small budget we are being given to try to implement what is , in fact , one of the great success stories of the Community . #% If we develop this operational capacity through the Petersberg Tasks , if we develop more coherence in aid and foreign policy , how can we then adopt more coherent policies in international fora ? #% We need to add to that the real threat here for the European Union . #% When that paper came out we saw it as a challenge to change . #% Is that a fair system ? #% Those who think that more Europe with Europe-wide political parties is the answer are , I believe , missing the point . #% I just wish to ask the Commissioner about another aspect of looking at unemployment criteria . #% The American Government could be boosting the armaments or the oil industries at home or it could be geared towards the re-election prospects of President George Bush , à la Margaret Thatcher . #% I am also very concerned about the projected increase in fluorocarbons , which are presently a minor contributor to the total greenhouse gases . #% There seems to be a need to direct our lives , to minimise risks and to tell us what to do . #% The IGC has the opportunity to enhance efficiency and effectiveness and to deepen the democratic character of the European Union . #% This , in itself , would be a very bold objective . #% The agri-dairy sector is as crucial to Ireland 's farmers as cocoa is to other producing countries , and I have no desire to minimize the importance of cocoa to the countries which are dependent on it . #% But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depositories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve . #% Positive developments in agriculture spending underlines the effectiveness of the integrated administrative and control system IACS and the simplification of claim and payment procedures in the newly introduced Single Payment Scheme . #% I fully support the budget increase . #% The Commission allows millions to be lost but has no consideration for those in the most desperate circumstances . #% They still do not get the levels of support , independence and protection they need . #% Subjecting social policy to the same regulation as business will not work . #% If politics were an exact science , the United States of Europe would already exist as the logical culmination of the aims of the Founding Fathers of the European Union , providing security and prosperity for its citizens and exercising a benign but powerful influence on the world stage . #% One of the things that really worries me about this is why he did it : because he was afraid that he was not going to get the decision from the Supreme Court that he expected or that he wanted . #% It was necessary to threaten the Commission with the sack in order to ensure that Parliament 's demands for more scrutiny of budgetary procedures and financial management were met , and to force the Commission to undertake a root-and-branch review of the Commission 's management of taxpayers ' money . #% Mr President , I have been approached by several colleagues who are concerned at the level of lobbying outside the entrance to Parliament . #% I call on the Council and Commission to assist the work of Parliament and take action which reflects the urgency of this situation . #% Mr President , while the Greens fully support the efforts of the Commission to create a sustainable fisheries policy within the EU , we reject any attempt to simply transfer our problems to the developing world . #% We must ensure that decision-making structures are put in place at EU level which will guarantee that all decisions are accounted for . #% In conclusion , it appears that this piece of legislation will go through under the Finnish Presidency and we can avoid tying these toxic chemicals up in the REACH queue . #% Since the disappearance of the children and family budget line in DG V there is no budget line which has children as a general target group . #% The Commission should have stuck to its original position and the Socialists should not have done a U-turn on this issue either . #% In the context of this debate , I am taking the opportunity to raise what is , mercifully , still a relatively small area of activity which has in recent years been criminalized . #% Alternative fuels have been a live agenda item in this Parliament for a number of years but we do not seem to be any closer to a practical outcome . #% author . - Madam President , I am very happy to support the call for the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by the EU Member States . #% Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area , Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education , training and youth fields . #% The further transfer of this information to Parliament and its ` competent committee ? and ` in accordance with relevant procedures ? is vague . #% Indeed , if we use the analogy of what happened with the European Company Statute , the legal basis is different despite the fact that there are similarities between the two proposals put forward . #% On the issue of the EU-Russia summit , which you also mentioned , it is essential that the major issue of Chechnya be raised with the Russians . #% The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination . #% Against this background I caution against any attempt to radically alter the administration and structure of the agricultural budget agreed in Berlin . #% We need from you communication of a vision and clarity of ideas , but they have to be acceptable ideas . #% That reservation arises from the fact that , to date , PEACE Funding in Northern Ireland has been allocated in a most imbalanced way , to the gross disadvantage to the Protestant/Unionist Community . #% More disappointing is the naked party political games which British Members Mr Davies , Mr Bradbourn and Mrs Evans have attempted in this resolution . #% Will this proposal for a regulation also end up in a fourth reading in Luxembourg ? #% It must not involve a transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank . #% Madam President , the Tempus programme has been successful ; it has made a unique contribution to the third-level system of education in the countries of central and eastern Europe . #% This is not a direct failure of the presidency but rather a failure of the collective will of the Council itself . #% We need more time and debate on these potential conflicts . #% To rectify our demographic crisis we must restore the basic integrity of human relationships . #% This resolution also calls for better convergence of financial reforms on both sides of the Atlantic , which I feel is very important to avoid any future crisis like the one that we are currently experiencing from happening again . #% 
The Commission should support Commissioner Flynn on this matter and get rid of tobacco subsidies in the interests of public health and of consumers . #% These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States . #% As Mrs Flesch said , we have worked very closely on this report . #% It enshrines among other things the constitutional protection of life , marriage and family and should not be vulnerable to decisions made without the full , informed consent of the Irish people . #% I am thinking , in particular , of the tourist industry in Ireland , which is worth EUR 4 billion . #% Politics is important because it affects people 's lives . #% Secondly , in the measures to assist beef producers who have lost money , will he be proposing that all beef producers who have suffered serious loss will be compensated . #% These provisions attack the very independence essential to any inquiry . #% Had this section been removed we could have supported the final report . #% I do not think they would . #% In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society . #% In my own country , the government launched in September a national alcohol policy based on a multi-sectoral approach which marshals a wide range of statutory and non-statutory organizations to work together to reduce the prevalence of alcoholrelated problems in Irish society by emphasizing moderation in alcohol consumption . #% But it would be wilful carnage to simply go in and slaughter good animals in the thought or the notion that BSE may possibly be in the whole herd . #% I really regret the way in which the Council has refused to discuss the matter properly with Parliament . #% Our task is not made any easier because we are asking the electorate to overturn a decision it has already made . #% Mr President , I wonder whether Members realize that the session is starting at this hour . #% I am still not satisfied , however . #% You can not have a dialogue when one side does not explain its reasoning for what it is doing . #% The governance of this historic city must be removed from any nationalistic or sectarian , in the best sense of that word , spirit and this governance must provide for equal access and rule for all . #% We should wait to hear what the discussions will be and ensure that we focus our work on real and important issues for European citizens , not pie-in-the-sky attitudes . #% Mary Robinson , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on having the wisdom of Solomon , the patience of Job and the tenacity of myself . #% Is he willing to bring this concern to the attention of the Council with a view to encouraging the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels to cease operations at Sellafield and , in particular , to stop the reprocessing of nuclear waste ? #% As Commissioner , will you now change your attitude and , at this late date , support restrictions on child online betting , at race tracks , in bookmakers , on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists ? #% The alternative is the United States making bilateral agreements from a position of strength with the poorer countries of the world . #% Control is also a very big problem in most of these agreements . #% Secondly , it is equally important that the existing workforce is retrained in the skills demanded by new and changing information technologies . #% I can understand the anger - if there is anger and I am sure there is - from the Spanish side and from those who have lost their business . #% We should not be involved with arms in the first place , to be honest . #% Now you have heard the repeated calls here today that something be done about unemployment and we are used to this in these types of debates . #% I have one area of concern in particular - and there is nothing in the report to help resolve the problem - and that is having a clear account of the illness and diseases suffered right across the European Union . #% The EU Constitution expounds the false position that the EU creates all rights , even fundamental rights . #% Far too often all the good intentions of every individual Member of this Parliament and the various committees , every good idea and every popular sentiment are catered for when drawing up the regulations , with the result that it is very hard for national governments to recognize what the thrust of our intentions is or how exactly they should administer the money . #% I should also like to agree with my colleagues who say we must have a real energy policy for the European Union . #% In particular , paragraph 8 was an important political signal to the Council . #% At last we dare to hope that lasting peace can now be guaranteed democratically . #% It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round . #% If the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are not competitive , then they will not be able to participate within the internal market in any real , effective sense . #% I have no hesitation in saying that promotional campaigns by banks and other lending agencies are contributing in a major way to inflationary house prices , thus putting housing outside the affordability of young people wishing to set up their first home . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I sympathise totally with the position that many German farmers find themselves in at the present time . #% I would like that proposal to be minuted . #% The fight against poverty and illiteracy must form the basis of any new arrangements and the acquis communautaire must be built upon in political economic and financial terms . #% But in the context of the current disaster there , Indonesia has become a symbol of the lengths to which a brutal , weak and unscrupulous regime will go to further its power and control over those it perceives as challenging its authority . #% In many of our communities house break-ins , muggings and violent attacks are considered to be more commonplace than had been the case years ago . #% We share common values . #% Mr President , firstly we welcome the reduction , if not the complete elimination , of paper quotas : this is a more realistic approach . #% Therefore , we need to vote on Amendment No 206 . #% We would say to Mr Balkenende and the new presidency that there is more to do to bring greater protection to vulnerable people , to bring about equality and respect among nations , to bring help to suffering countries like Sudan and to bring democracy and transparency to the EU project itself . #% Because not everyone gains equally . #% Loyalist terrorists have also made organised crime their forte , particularly in the despicable drugs trade . #% The European Union guarantees freedom of expression and information in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mrs Wulf-Mathies for being the visible face of the European Community in Northern Ireland and I want to say that I hope we can continue with the assistance we are giving which has meant so much . #% It is quite obvious , of course , that small countries like Ireland , Belgium and Luxembourg need free trade , but a European Union with a single market or a North American single market is an entirely different proposition . #% Secondly , that the small and medium-sized enterprise sector , which has been spoken about by other colleagues , be given freedom to operate and create new jobs and new economic growth within the whole European Union . #% Mr President , when the lights went out in California , in Turin and even in my own home town of Wexford -- not to mention the recent Gazprom incident -- there was a sudden concentration of minds on the security of energy supply , which is of critical importance to us both strategically and economically , particularly with energy import dependency and costs growing exponentially . #% That mistrust is to some degree - and maybe unintentionally - fostered by the national authorities and departments who represent the Commission as the oppressive force which is responsible for all the regulation . #% On 28 August last , you requested the assistance of the Spanish authorities on the issue of the competent authority to transmit this document . #% Mr President , the pig industry in Northern Ireland has been hit worse than all the other sectors in agriculture which are already in crisis , as the Commissioner knows . #% It was a very comprehensive reply indeed , but one of the issues I have discovered , over almost thirty years of involvement in development , is the lack of emphasis on education . #% Organised crime gangs with vast resources at their disposal are operating with impunity . #% Parliament has responded to your leadership . #% My Group was not in favour of this invitation , and , as I understand it , neither was the ELDR Group nor the GUE/NGL Group . #% However , I am disappointed that there is no further evidence of any development in regard to digital literacy . #% These issues are exclusively for Member States . #% The modes of transportation are likewise , in my opinion , of the highest quality and standards . #% It moves money as well as infiltrating business , politics and worldwide legal and police systems with impunity . #% 
Mr President , I am glad to see Commissioner Kinnock here , but where is Commissioner Prodi ? #% FMD-vaccinated animals are not infectious when they get into the food chain . #% A man died last week because he could not have simple surgery in our hospital system . #% If a Member State is willing and progressive enough to take more stringent measures then surely it should be allowed to do that . #% There is plenty of time : we have years to go in relation to this . #% I would like to ask President Santer : how can the committee act as an ethical scrutiny body on biotechnological inventions as Parliament wants , when its remit is only to look at basic ethical principles and not at individual issues raised by patent applications ? #% My question also relates to the historical responsibility of the European Union , including the presidency , for colonialism and for the atrocities committed in various states . #% The way in which Roisín McAliskey , an unconvicted prisoner and expectant mother , has been treated in Holloway Prison is outrageous . #% I should like to link this with other matters we have debated at previous part-sessions - indeed I am sure we will be debating them again this week - and make an appeal about the language we use to describe these terrorists . #% We anticipate , if I understand correctly , a report in September on core activities . #% The rapporteur has rightly pointed out that it is possible to save large quantities of oil using existing technology . #% Yes , there are still many bridges to cross , but today , in my opinion , we have crossed the Rubicon . #% During earlier debates in this House I said the purpose of modern plant breeding is to improve quality and increase the resistance to disease while also increasing the yields of cultivated plants . #% I strongly support their flexibility . #% The European Commission identifies the weaknesses in this plan and says : This is the way we would like our money to be spent in addition to what you have already allocated for all this work you intend to do . #% It should be no surprise to anyone that fishermen will have the greatest interests in this agency . #% Yet surrounding it are grave and serious political issues that are not getting the quality time and attention that we believe they need if this is to be a success . #% It would be extremely strange if the European Parliament did not support this last request . #% Secondly , in formulating these proposals , have you also looked at the use of alternative industry or energy , particularly with respect to the use of sugar beet in biofuels/bioenergy ? #% In many cases , the lack of adequate economic return has been an important factor in the failure of sponsoring companies to commit the necessary resources to generating the data necessary to satisfy EU regulatory requirements for fixing MRLs . #% The recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing EU farmers . #% I would like to thank Mrs Bonino . #% Passengers should not need to pay for security . #% In order to counter this unacceptable situation , government needs to step in with stronger regulation and resourcing of the relevant consumer protection agencies . #% A woman who has been abused by a rapist needs help and protection , not more death and destruction . #% There are scientists so arrogant today that they are already patenting their discoveries , as if they had stumbled upon their own creation . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this is a report on preparing for demographic change . #% I support it as does my group and , along with Mr Spencer , I commend it to the House . #% Mr President , since 1992 LIFE -- the Financial Instrument for the Environment -- has been the major vehicle of European Community Environment policy . #% If we believe , as I do , that the European agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable , equally it must be commercially viable and competitive . #% Many of Altiero Spinelli 's recommendations have been included in the Treaties which have been enacted over the last 18 years . #% There are very serious questions here , Commissioner , and I do not consider it sufficient for you to say simply that you have asked the UK authorities . #% The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of e-business . #% The Government does nothing to stop the fires because there are big-money interests involved . #% All in all , Socrates is addressing in a unique and effective way the need for a greater intra-community action in the field of education thus leading to a greater understanding and sharing of Europe 's diverse culture . #% Now is the time to bring it to an end . #% The signing of the ratification protocol for Kyoto by some of the major players has been a much-welcomed event . #% We strongly urge Parliament to reinstate the need for a separate ethics committee able to look at patent application and Amendment No 76 regarding material of foreign and human origin ' . #% But we all agree that transport is the key energy problem : fossil fuels must be replaced by alternatives , and very soon . #% This has been my view for some time . #% As you know , it is one of the main focuses of the Irish presidency . #% And yes , let me endorse your point about agriculture in the developing world : it has been neglected for far too long . #% We must lead by example and do the same in Belfast . #% We are second worst in terms of transposition and designation of sites under the habitats directive . #% I would like to join , I am sure in the name of all in this House , in utterly condemning that terrorism and in expressing condolence and sympathy to those who have been injured and killed . #% The confusion exists because this House adopted in July at first reading a conflicting proposal which both allowed and prohibited the patenting of the human genome . #% In this respect , I call on the Commission to make a declaration , on the record , that it will be assiduous in pursuing its obligations as enforcer of the Treaty in relation to this regulation and that it will take particular care to police and monitor any stricter measures that are proposed by Member States , in the interests of furthering the internal market within the bounds of Article 175 . #% Ireland has no energy recovery or incineration facilities so all our targets have to be met through recycling alone . #% All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position , Madam President . #% I am glad that Mr Prodi emphasised the overriding importance of sustainable development , which has implications well beyond the natural environment . #% The one thing that everybody is focused on is how the repayment system works in this Parliament . #% There is something wrong with a system that allows that off the coastal waters of Ireland . #% Most ominously , the lives of Father Cullen , his assistant and legal adviser have been threatened . #% I would strongly urge the Education Ministers from within the EU to put in place a system which eliminates any element of inequality with regard to the administration of the Erasmus programme . #% We have to stress , as you said , the need for a fair and equitable distribution of resources while retaining priority for poorer areas and declining regions . #% We still have not even the slightest idea of how many are missing here in Europe . #% Ireland suffers doubly from safety problems , road congestion and environmental damage . #% Parliament and the Commission are right to be adamant that the Union must improve its telecommunications network . #% The credibility of our single currency and its public image and acceptance depend on all Member States adhering fully to it and the rules being applied evenly under the Stability Pact . #% It should not be forgotten that the United Nations fulfilled a similar role in East Timor in 1999 . #% Mr President , because time is short I will start by saying what we need to do . #% Each Member State has been allocated a certain capacity for fishing vessels in tonnage and kilowatts , but there is no requirement for that capacity to be reduced . #% We welcomed the launching of the general debate last year on a consistent approach to the questions of migration and asylum . #% I thank the President-in-Office . #% We must continue to enlarge and expand that role . #% I should like to speak in particular about the social fund regulations and thank Mrs Jöns for her very visionary and forward-looking report . #% 
After all , the Commission gave a favourable opinion in 1995 as did this Parliament , on Malta 's accession . #% On a point of order , I apologise to the President-in-Office and to you , Mr President , that I was not here for my question . #% Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa . #% So coastguard cooperation might be very loose or it could be something more structured . #% Thus , the balance shifted in favour of restrictions which are so burdensome that they have the potential to drive parts of our chemical industry out of the EU . #% Now that there is a larger swathe of territory not subject to Taliban control , we must visibly and urgently assess what needs to be done and be present on the ground . #% The Commission 's proposal is an excellent one and I fully support it . #% People need to realise that globalisation is here , and it is here to stay . #% Mr President , I should like to begin with the disturbing problem of the lack of consensus which has re-emerged on the question of fiscal policy at the heart of the EMU debate . #% Mr President , you will note by the number of Irish people wishing to speak in the debate today that this is an issue very close to our hearts . #% Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the British presidency for their participation in the peace process in Ireland . #% The American presence will reassure the Israelis , who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally . #% Mr President , Commissioner , first of all I should like to join with other speakers in commending the excellent work of the rapporteur , my colleague Mr Brok . #% What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations . #% I would also repeat that all Members are entitled to request a filter for their system if they are being annoyed by these e-mails , which will then be removed . #% I know that many items which people want tackled are high on our agenda but they are not being dealt with at the IGC . #% Firstly , with regard to mobile workers , the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rigours of the original working time directive . #% At present , none of the proposals to include additional bans on the use of F-gases in certain applications have been subjected to impact assessments or comprehensive health and safety or even cost-benefit analysis by the Commission . #% Under the current legislation , there are no clear lines of responsibility . #% It has been very hard to have a reasonable rational debate on the impact of an outbreak of BSE , be it 3 , 4 or several hundred cases at a time . #% We require a reorganization of the Commission 's personnel and a refocusing of policy . #% Like Lord Inglewood , I do not believe that the Council has the answers to these problems . #% Madam President , I want to point out that this report basically accepts the whole idea of globalization , the internal market , absolute free trade and the free movement of capital . #% We have to be frank about this . #% The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy , one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation . #% There was not a single minister able to explain that . #% I might conclude by saying that I would have preferred it if the British entered EMU at the first opportunity . #% Sound economics , realism and results are what the citizens want , and our job is to deliver . #% Mr President , I hope the Commissioner appreciates how happy the Irish car buyer would be to see VRT eliminated . #% Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours , paragraph 1 is extremely important . #% From my work in rural development and the number of new jobs created in programmes like LEADER and other Community-based enterprise schemes , I am of the opinion that in the past we have ignored the potential of our human resources , our people , to play a meaningful role in the generation of wealth . #% I reiterate the point that we can not compromise in any respect the safety of our EU citizens . #% It is the duty of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify failure in administration and propose solutions . #% I say to the Commission that the CFP must be geared towards keeping alive regions which depend on fishing rather than making it a battlefield between Member States . #% If you look at the report itself , it is geared towards facilitating the common foreign and security policy . #% The Commission report was originally scheduled for 1990 but , for a variety of reasons , it was delayed until last summer . #% Commissioner , you have stated on a number of occasions that you have a preference for administrative sanctions as against criminal sanctions . #% We have one of the main links between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Belfast . #% I respect the fact that there were sincerely-held views on both sides in the debate over Pakistan . #% If not , we will put a false floor under rented land and active farmers will not be able to afford it . #% Last June 's referendum result was a major disappointment , particularly given the 30 % turnout . #% The implementation date of 2010 gives both sides of industry time to negotiate new agreements that take account of the 48-hour week . #% We still have enormous problems of social exclusion , especially in deprived urban and rural communities , and , indeed , underdevelopment . #% Mr Haarder said earlier that there is an exciting debate in progress in the Convention . #% Its institutions are not imitations : they are unique institutions reflecting unique arrangements of Member States , intergovernmentalism , cooperation , coordination and -- despite what some colleagues may say -- democracy . #% In the same period there have been profound increases in the extent and quantity of habitats and natural resources that are formally recognised and protected . #% These were approved unanimously in the Legal Affairs Committee . #% The amendments which the Commission can not support are : 1 , 2 , 6 to 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 to 22 , 24 to 30 , 32 , 33 , 35 to 50 . #% The second point I wish to make is in relation to the nuclear and chemical industries in Europe . #% I passed a remark . #% I come from an agricultural background and it seems to me that what you need to control is the whole life span of the animal from the moment it is born to the time it is slaughtered . #% I hope that politicians and local authorities in Ireland can join forces with members of the Greater London Assembly and other groups in England to intensify the battle to see that BNFL close down the nuclear white elephant of the Sellafield plant . #% Tax competition within the European Union has been healthy for growth and has been beneficial and of assistance . #% Unfortunately , the only way of controlling it , at the moment , is by large-scale slaughter of animals , many of which are free from disease . #% Staying with agriculture , I share the concern of many colleagues over the proposed across-the-board reduction of EUR 275 million in agricultural spending . #% What has the Commission done in its approach to agreements , other than to change the name ? #% We must respect differences and give a proper and meaningful role to the different religions in the European Union , but we expect mutual recognition . #% The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient . #% As a result the Group favours maintaining Article 235 as an instrument capable of responding to the inherent , evolutionary character to interpret the objectives of the Union . ' #% I would like to emphasise that the derogations in question are from the timetable and not from the substantive targets . #% We must not be involved in promoting the consumption of all fish no matter what species , the area where it was caught or the gear that was used . #% This , I believe , is necessary in the European Union . #% We all know what those prisoners are suffering . #% I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government . #% Consumer protection must have absolute priority in all measures regarding food safety . #% While dealing swiftly with the debt of countries affected by the tsunami , the international community must not lessen the priority to focus on the need to cancel the unpayable debt of poor countries to enable them to progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals . #% 
In spite of generous EU support , which I acknowledge , family farms are disappearing from the rural landscape . #% Most people subscribe to this in theory but not in practice . #% Frankly , the EU is not punching its weight in research , although some Member States are very good . #% It has been a long , and at times faltering , road to achieving peace and no one knows that better than our own Nobel Peace Prizewinner , John Hume . #% Considering that this is something like 48 % of the entire budget - EUR 38 or 39 billion - it is quite an achievement , spent over fifteen countries , that the budget was within two and a half per cent of estimate and that waste and the possibility for loss were lower than the average for the budget . #% This paragraph calls on a judge at the European Court of Justice to resign his European post due to his earlier personal decision when he was Minister for Justice to permit the early release of Marc Diedres who is suspected of multiple child murders . #% The one year extension makes it very clear that not much has changed . #% Finally , with regard to the paper industry : it should clean up its bad former record on the pollution of the environment , and it is also important to inquire into the difficulties of monopolies in the paper sector , particularly with regard to cartels in the recycling sector . #% I am particularly interested in the issue of a central registry where all children abducted - whether they are parental or criminal abductions - will be notified and action taken . #% This is a core challenge that we look to you and to the Commission to resolve in terms of foreign policy . #% Ireland enjoys a relatively sophisticated mortgage credit market in EU terms , including access to the full range of competitively priced mortgage products . #% Above all , it should serve as well as possible the important environmental objectives it purports to achieve . #% We recognise that standing alone is of little benefit when international cooperation is increasing . #% There is no doubt about the existence of a growing cocktail of chemicals in our daily lives . #% Mesh sizes for fixed gears must be harmonised . #% The European Union must ensure that these international commitments are fulfilled . #% Mr President , I welcome this debate and I welcome very much the Commission 's communication on which it is based . #% I know that the Swedish Presidency wants to change that and involve citizens more extensively and be more transparent . #% But equally we believe that it is important that a well-founded national anxiety should not be transformed into a collective European angst and political deadlock . #% The Treaty of Nice does not build a two-tier European Union whereby larger Member States can dictate the pace of change within the Union at the expense of the smaller states . #% Two meetings of Iraqi political leaders have now taken place . #% Around half of the people who become infected with HIV do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35 . #% They exchange their money at the rate that the Euro gives them . #% In that regard , I welcome the recent decision by Commissioner Barrot to introduce new guidelines laying down conditions under which start-up aid can be granted to airlines in regional airports . #% It is however my view that EMSA should not be given responsibilities for combating terrorism : these must continue to be the responsibility of the Member States , and I welcome the clarifications contained in the report in this regard . #% This referendum undoubtedly underlines the need for greater efforts to be made by all of us to explain European Union policies to our citizens and to involve the citizens of the EU more thoroughly in the debate about the Union 's role and its future direction . #% We have had political differences in the recent past but the time has now come to put these problems behind us . #% I would agree with Dagmar Roth-Behrendt and others who have spoken here , that adults have free will to take up smoking or to take up drinking , but it is deplorable that young people are encouraged to take up smoking as the result of billboard advertising and advertising generally . #% Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU 's negotiating mandate at WTO level , as approved by the Council in 1999 . #% And I fully support his call for the European Renewable Energies Export Council to be strengthened . #% -- Mr President , I rarely say that it is a function of mine to defend the Commission , but Commissioners have the right to freedom of expression and , just occasionally , they may even say eminently sensible things , like President Barroso when he accepted that the Constitution is unenforceable and that we need to move on . #% He is one of the finance ministers who sought to deny this Parliament its democratic right to control the budget of the European Union . #% Although many people have expressed their disgust , I do not know how we are going to go back to the electorate and justify that basically things are remaining the same . #% I suspect , Mr President-in-Office , that we lack courage to tackle this major problem . #% President-in-Office , why did an Irish presidency choose to initiate diplomatic relations with the military dictatorship in Burma ? #% Since this time Irish Equitable Life policyholders have lost their investment , which in many cases means their life savings . #% It is the beginning of a debate - an honest debate - that we want to be involved in as parliamentarians . #% Is it not the case that the directives , as they are implemented , would not allow a regulator to reveal confidential information that might dissuade a policyholder from investing in companies with problems like Equitable ? #% This is indeed a breakthrough for our citizens and a concrete example to them of the way that the European Union can be of direct benefit . #% This is partly due to the advent of BSE , foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and the chicken dioxin scandal that took place a couple of years ago . #% This will give us the strongest position when we negotiate with the Council . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the British Prime Minister to the European Parliament . #% We want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment . #% The Laeken Declaration made clear both the extent of the achievements of the European Union over the past 45 years and the scale of the challenges which it now faces . #% I share Mr Howitt 's concern that the existing laws do not crack down on the proceeds of crime . #% We have good reason to believe that Abu Omar was in fact tortured in Egypt . #% This was a momentous occasion in European history , finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War . #% As some of you will be aware , at first reading last year I proposed that this recommendation be strengthened to include a review which would lead to a further legal framework on coastal zone management . #% Perhaps we should hand out landmines to everyone in the House , because it is not dissimilar to saying that drugs are not dangerous . #% Amendments by the European Parliament have ensured that the importance of European cinema is being recognised under the MEDIA programme for the purpose of intercultural dialogue , linguistic and cultural diversity and non-discrimination . #% With that target in mind , and as we are now making long-term energy choices , we should be phasing out nuclear plants over the coming years across Europe . #% As a further safeguard , and to assist SMEs , I have proposed an amendment to introduce an online register where any stricter measures that are compatible with the single market under Article 176 would be recorded in an easily accessible single document . #% Hence this debate . #% I agree with what my colleague , Bernd Lange , has said . #% Children spend their whole education in Portakabins . #% There is a very disquieting level of public support indicated by opinion polls . #% Therefore , a very comprehensive aid and development programme is required to meet the long-term needs of the country and its people . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , our resolutions on this issue address the dual challenges of eradicating hunger - which currently affects one sixth of the world 's population - and securing a food supply for the future . #% The European Union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people , both collectively and individually , is always protected . #% This situation is particularly associated with football clubs and their search for talent . #% The EU is a major legal market . #% The company made a very interesting statement after Harland & Wolff were turned down . #% I would call on Mr Hughes and those who feel they want to vote for his amendment to take common sense into consideration . #% Since aftercare is an important part of the directive , it is essential that these sites due to be closed come under the directive . #% We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest , public services , to survive and to prosper , and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe . #% The mid-term review brought us many changes , and we are about to embark on even more . #% 
For this reason I have indicated on my group 's voting list a negative vote on certain paragraphs that duplicate points mentioned elsewhere in the report . #% It is therefore very worrying that the beekeeping sector continues to report that the mortality rates are astonishingly high . #% In this case though , I was designated to speak on this very important issue for the Group and I seek to make that statement now . #% Mr President , I should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the rapporteur , to the Spanish presidency and to Commissioner Busquin who has been exemplary in his patience , understanding and respect for Parliament 's opinions . #% I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under a framework of the United Nations . #% Madam President , I would be very obliged if you would read the name of the card I was accused of voting for twice and have the services check if votes were cast on that card . #% The Council and Parliament must have a veto right . #% This is due , at least in part , to the conflicting nature of some of the objectives of the CFP as laid down in Regulation 3760/92 . #% We congratulate Mr Böge on his report and we are happy with its broad thrust . #% But we are in a dilemma here . #% Could the Commission also comment on the lack of effectiveness of the present inspectorate in this regard ? #% I ask you , Commissioner - and I would like an answer - what part does our development aid play in this kind of suffering ? #% Let these little children go to school unhindered . #% Finally , I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45 . #% The Agency , created in 1975 , provides excellent services for the European Commission , the European Union Member States and the social partners , as well as for the associated countries of Norway and Iceland . #% Mr Hallam has gone one better than that . #% In relation to trade names and individual companies it is very important that a vague system of alerts is in place which allows the consumer to make a choice . #% The establishment of a free trade area would have dramatic consequences for working people in the region . #% The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns , but it does ask the hard questions , and rightly so , if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues , such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom ; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane , degrading treatment and internment without trial ; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps ; forced compliance with family planning policy ; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners . #% We really need to change this . #% This procedure is not perfect , but it is more responsive than codecision and ensures informed scientific analysis and risk assessment , rather than risking emotive concerns guiding European decisions in technical areas . #% The views of the patient groups , which were very strong at first and second reading , were that we must not rule out remuneration , but it must not be the rule . #% I would like to see a communication in 1997 to allow Parliament to take decisions in this vital area of policy . #% It seems to me that there is a lot of work to be done in terms of developing the notion of European citizenship and it is a mistake to reduce it to the notion of political citizenship , although that is an important aspect of it . #% I suppose it is very easy with hindsight to talk about what could or should have been done or what we did not do , but now , with the benefit of that hindsight , we could put mechanisms in place to ensure that this never happens again . #% Earlier , we spoke about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and how it can assist redundant workers in certain sectors . #% I want to echo the concerns of many people in Ireland and the international community about the circumstances surrounding this murder . #% They have murdered an innocent man and severely injured his colleague . #% The EU Convention must remember that many candidate countries are due to hold referenda on EU accession . #% We will all be in a stronger position to make a judgment on the state of the negotiations to put in place a new European Union treaty when the Taoiseach gives a report of his bilateral discussions to the Council meeting of European Union leaders in March . #% in writing . - I support this piece of legislation regulating hedge funds and private equity . #% They will also know that the three MEPs in this House representing Northern Ireland met the Prime Minister last Wednesday and he told us that he was going to negotiate a package with European help . #% We should look at areas such as transmission losses , potential in the transport sector and where energy is going to come from when other sources are exhausted . #% I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real . #% To date , the British Government has refused to conduct an international environmental impact assessment on the significant risks posed to the environment and people 's health along the transportation routes of nuclear waste . #% I should like to respond to the Commissioner 's good wishes by wishing him and his colleagues , especially my Irish colleague , Commissioner Flynn and the President of Parliament a happy New Year . #% The European Commission has yet to explain clearly what it intends to do to support low-cost air travel in Europe in the future . #% The amendments aim to protect the principles of non-commercialisation of the human body and its parts through voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells , to prohibit all interventions in the human germline which could be passed on to future generations and to ensure that no material from human-animal hybrid embryos or chimeras would be used in research . #% In the name of those being driven from employment right across Europe , I call for a root and branch reassessment of our approach to cheap imports , so that the social economic consequences are properly considered . #% Indeed , this is further evidence for the need to enhance maternity and paternity leave provisions to enable women and men to strike a balance between work and family commitments . #% In this regard , I would like in particular to welcome and support the proposal for the dissemination and communication of information through innovative libraries and new technologies . #% On Monday night , as a member of that British Parliament , I voted a censure motion against Mr Douglas Hogg . #% There is a better way to enforce the law , to make it more equitable and to ensure that we can react to the concerns of the individual addicts who want to recover and get treatment . #% This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker 's rights and working conditions , calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour . #% The BSE crisis in the UK has almost ruined our export markets . #% There can be no tolerance in the Commission of fraud , corruption or financial irregularities . #% Our concerns about trafficking in children as the world was beating a path to their door in search of children became obscured between the desperation of parents looking for children to adopt and the clear indications that many of those who were facilitating commercial trafficking in children became part of the politics of Romania , and indeed those countries whose nationals were pressurising for open adoption , notably the USA . #% I also hope that the Commission will understand from this debate tonight that we are not willing , as a Parliament , to lie down and be walked over by anyone . #% The debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework is an opportunity for fundamental reform and it must be seized . #% Mr President , first of all I think it is outrageous and very irresponsible of the Commission that it should actually pursue something without first having an independent assessment of its consequences . #% Sinn Féin is not and has not been doing enough to bring justice to this horrid affair . #% I particularly welcome the commitment to streamline the codecision procedure , thus putting both sides of the European Union legislature , the Council of Ministers representing the Member States and us , in the European Parliament , representing the people , on a truly equal footing . #% I understand that Total has recently done a deal with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Exploration Company . #% People have been badly burnt and the system has failed them . #% Diplomats and politicians can not be allowed to run too far ahead of the people of Europe on the issue of future developments . #% If rural society is not economically and socially attractive to women it will be impossible to retain living and vibrant rural communities . #% We need to open that debate . #% Knowing the state of ` underdevelopment ' of recycling and waste management in my own country , Ireland , for example , I sincerely hope they mean what they say in agreeing to this directive and I fully support the fact that they have done so . #% I use the words ` marking ' very carefully because I do not think we can celebrate the tenth anniversary of the first Earth Summit . #% At a time when the European Union is expanding to include ten new countries and when these countries are making stringent efforts to encourage economic growth , we have a duty at least to give these countries access to resources , which the existing fifteen have had access to in the past . #% In the on-going reform process , the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability . #% Honesty : telling the truth even when it is not comfortable to do so . #% The bottom line is that consumers need to know what redress they can expect if they are the victims of sharp practice or rip-offs , while business needs to operate in a competitive world . #% It can be complementary to the activities going on there and can help to improve the economy of the European Union at a time when unemployment is once again becoming a problem . #% Yes , you will get there , but I seriously question whether this is a method that we should even contemplate at this stage . #% 
This was the justification , despite what some people were saying all along about the situation . #% In that context , I continue to call on my own government in Ireland to at least make an offer of troops , even if the numbers are small , because I believe they have a positive role to play . #% Thirdly , as the budgetary authority we should be more focused in how we allocate funding in the social fund and the Structural Funds to reward those that are achieving the most with regard to meeting the guidelines as laid down by this House . #% Mr President , I welcome this excellent report and congratulate the rapporteur . #% Finally , fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat , but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce . #% However , major players now need to be more proactive in convincing countries with the highest levels of pollution : the United States and developing countries . #% The single currency will be another step . #% That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Giegold report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues that arise in this report . #% This whole policy is completely restrictive . #% People in Europe are involved in scams and bogus companies that are lending and giving money to Africa and they have to be stopped . #% It has been well documented that air transport is a very safe mode of transport and this should , and must , remain the case . #% In some ways this Commission communication has been overtaken by events and I am delighted to see that in the General Affairs Council this week there has been a victory for common sense . #% I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report , which supports the main thrust of the Commission 's plans , as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation . #% I am convinced that this must entail such factors as closer links between fishermen , scientists , the recognition of the socio-economic factors in areas highly dependent on fisheries , flexibility and simplification . #% Politically it was not very popular in the past but the fishing communities throughout the European Union are beginning to recognize that there are possibilities and that it can be achieved without damage to our environment and it can help to save coastal communities . #% We note with particular concern the Commission 's report of last week - the pre-Stockholm report - about the Lisbon process . #% To achieve a better understanding between the institutions is important , but I want to underline that this is just an interim agreement . #% A clear plan in this regard must be implemented by the year 2000 . #% In a statement on 2 May Mr Duisenberg explained that in view of his age he did not want to serve a full term but added that in future , the decision to resign would be his , and his alone . #% It is up to the Member States to formulate the most appropriate and responsible policies aimed at integrating religious minorities into society . #% Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there . #% We must not , and can not , lose sight of this fact , but we must look at the bigger picture . #% We also have to address the use of industrial fishing to feed aquaculture . #% Employment obviously plays a key role , but it must be remarked that too many of our homeless , and indeed our poor , actually have a job . #% Mr President , I hoped to be able to say something before Mrs Van Dijk left . #% In addition to cooperating with the World Health Organisation , we can put in place preparatory plans for dealing with any potential outbreaks . #% It is worth bearing in mind that a 1 % increase can lead to ecosystem damage . #% Why is the list of reviewers not published ? #% Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification . #% I support working towards reaching an agreement by the end of next year , but equally we must not and should not hurry possible fundamental reforms to existing treaties without due consideration and evaluation . #% Some people will say that Vietnam is being singled out on its human rights record and that the other ASEAN members are free from this kind of human rights conditionality . #% I would suggest that the way to remedy this would be firstly that all appointments and contracts be openly advertised , decided independently and scrutinised by the Parliament . #% If you think about the tragic history of the whole Balkans region , one of the aspects that had been missing for so long was this idea of justice . #% I believe it is important to make the best possible use of these opportunities . #% This is an accumulation of an ineffective and inefficient system over years . #% Healthcare migration is certainly to our benefit , but as lives are saved in developed countries , they are lost in less developed countries . #% Groups campaigning against the arms trade have been very frustrated by this . #% Much as I appreciate that speech , I am somewhat disconcerted by Gordon Brown 's annual address at the Mansion House last night . #% The measures we are dealing with today aim at the effective protection of European waters against the risk of accidents at sea and marine pollution . #% While we should acknowledge the advances made by the European aviation industry 's voluntary initiative , the Emissions Containment Policy , with EU air traffic movements set to double by 2020 over the 2003 level , the real question is whether , on the basis of the polluter pays principle , this voluntary initiative will be adequate to counteract rising emissions from air transport . #% I would , however , like to make three points . #% To go back to a point that the Union for Europe Group made about the additive to cider , I am from Ireland and I am not in favour of this additive . #% I had also hoped that I would have a chance to personally thank President Gil-Robles because he has been a continual support to me in my work as mediator for abducted children , and also to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work as European Ombudsman . #% He believes in providing incentives for the rich by giving them more wealth , more profits and more tax incentives -- and in providing incentives for the poor by giving them a kick in the arse . #% It recently brought out proposals to increase cooperation within the Union on international terrorism and organised crime . #% I would like to indicate my total opposition to the proposals in Agenda 2000 relating to the reform of the CAP . #% We have been very lucky in a lot of ways in that , at those times of crisis , many of our leaders have been able to stay calm and wait for the intelligence information to come through before responding to the threat . #% Who gains ? #% If this is not done , and done very soon , then the crisis in the sector can only escalate . #% It would suit them better if they attended committee and put their energy and effort into committee work instead of taking up your time . #% In fact , further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides , because it would allow us to get rid of some of the misconceptions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries , or debating in our national parliaments . #% We need to get to grips with the United States and persuade them that a law-based world order is far better than a Pax Americana . #% The situation in agriculture is similar . #% Item No 5 which is listed under the heading China is in fact a call for political solidarity by European Member States with those states threatened by Chinese retaliation in trade or other terms as a result of the UN Human Rights Conference in Geneva . #% It is unacceptable for human life , whatever its age , to be treated as a commercial product , without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos . #% On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to lay particular emphasis on our distress at the code of secrecy rather than the code of transparency normally promoted by the Council . #% We should withhold our consent to ACTA until we receive written guarantees on these critical issues . #% The Iranian Government and Iranian Parliament have expressed their gratitude to the EU and to the broader international community for the assistance they have been given to help in the reconstruction of Bam and to help the thousands of displaced persons in this region . #% I believe that responsibility for development has to remain within the remit of the Development Commissioner , who needs to push for better policy coherence , especially as regards trade , common agriculture and fisheries policies . #% Contrary to what the cosmetics industry states , it is possible to produce and sell safe products whose ingredients have not been tested on animals . #% It is not something that has been copied from some other model . #% This presents you with the challenge of finding a common approach . #% My own experience in Ireland is that the real needs of the many thousands of people , mainly women , who care for our 25 000 or so sufferers of Alzheimer 's disease , are neglected . #% We can now move to the vote . #% Finally , I am indeed pleased that the European Parliament has been given the power of codecision by the Amsterdam Treaty , with the European Council of Health Ministers , on all new proposals for European legislation in the area of public health and human health . #% 
REACH will make it easier to develop and market new and safer substances and it will greatly reassure European consumers as manufacturers , producers and importers register chemicals and supply information about their properties . #% That is a scientific fact , not a passionate policy comment on my part . #% It is carried by small flies , by what we call midges , and has to be brought under control this summer . #% We also need finally to take seriously the question of the sorting of waste into recyclable groups of waste and of course , the recycling of treated waste . #% However , we need to play our part in finding ways to create fresh enthusiasm and acceptance for the roadmap as the way forward and , in this regard , the difficult task of engaging with Syria will be necessary . #% It is five minutes into its new programme . #% Clearly this has not been the case and must be viewed as an abject failure for the so-called humanitarian aid programmes the EU is supposed to operate on occasions like this . #% This is not a policy that is in transition but rather a policy that we will have for the foreseeable future , particularly with the imminent enlargement , and we must simplify the whole policy so that these funds can be spent . #% She knows my country very well , and there will be great distress when they hear she is ill and unable to continue her work here in Parliament . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their work on the EU budget for 2003 which now stands at almost EUR 100 billion . #% So far I can not see that we have obtained very much . #% You have been an impressive defender and promoter of the Charter on Fundamental Rights and we salute you for that . #% I thank my colleagues for their understanding , particularly Mrs Schleicher , who represented our case with understanding through all stages , especially at conciliation . #% The process has therefore been thorough . #% We know what our obligations are . #% The general principle should be to ensure that animals are slaughtered as close as possible to the point of production . #% Mr President , I thank Mme Guinebertière for her heroic work on this very complex document . #% Another important paragraph is paragraph 20 , which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter . #% It is consistent therefore with Agenda 2000 , and will not require changes to the common agricultural policy ; the EU level of export subsidies and domestic support in the so-called ` yellowbox ' are already below the levels of reduction commitments proposed ; the market access proposals can also be accommodated without disrupting EU markets ; and the EU is already committed to reducing tariffs and quota barriers on imports from the least-developed countries and from all developing countries , as proposed in the paper . #% That is why the Commission has been trying for some years to convince the Council of the need for a recovery plan . #% I am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted . #% It is extremely regrettable if we , at European level , the institutions who organise the common agricultural policy on which the farmers of the Union depend for their livelihood , can not obtain correct information on which to base an effective policy . #% Having looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years , one of the things that strikes me is : what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy ? #% The job is generally associated with low wages and unreliability . #% Either the research is acceptable and respectful of human life and the dignity of humankind or it is not . #% The foundation they receive is of utmost importance , but the time , space and nurturing children need to grow and develop fully is becoming a luxury afforded to fewer and fewer . #% Only last November the European Parliament voted in favour of a proposal which I tabled calling for a universal ban on the cloning of human beings . #% The third and most important principle is what I call the healing process . #% The citizens of that state do not have equal rights . #% What I am asking you today , Mr President and Members , is that we have a rotation process in those offices so that every four years there is a rotation of the A grades in those offices so that they become familiar with one another , with the workings of this Parliament and with the work of its Members . #% We all want to see the welfare of animals being transported long distances protected . #% These chemical substances are known to be very toxic , persistent and bioaccumulative . #% I totally condemn all terrorism , whatever its source , and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation . #% There are those who have said to me that this still does not go far enough , but I think we have the best consensus available to us at this moment in time . #% We need to reaffirm what was agreed at the European Council in Madrid . #% Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement . #% in writing . - This report aims to protect those who are unjustly marginalised and ensure that they have proper and adequate means to address their situation . #% Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report . #% To quote directly , Commissioner Dimas welcomed the agreement as ` a clear and positive political signal ' but alluded to the fact that the Commission would later decide whether to issue a declaration on the record when the legislation was finally adopted , as it is scheduled to be tomorrow . #% I support a review of the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact . #% Hours spent discussing better regulation and relations between the Commission and the European Parliament come to nothing if they are disregarded in this House by the Commission and Commission spokespersons . #% In Dublin this weekend , Gerry Adams boasted that the IRA campaign of atrocities were the acts of freedom fighters and not the acts of terrorists . #% We must know who they are . #% We should brace ourselves within the European Union for more revelations of collusion between the police and politicians . #% Mr President , since the attacks of 11 September , the Malaysian Government has stepped up its internal security measures , allegedly against suspected Islamic militants . #% We can go with a ` yes ' or we can go with a ` no ' , but there is no debate on the basis of ` yes , but ... ' . #% In the report there are a number of very important improvements in relation to consumers and consumer information . #% In recent times the mask has slipped and parties who advocate peaceful means have used inflammatory language , which exacerbates rather than calms the situation . #% What are we going to do in relation to deregulation to allow businesses to flourish , to allow innovation ? #% I would hope to see in the future -- particularly as other small countries are now present and we are no longer in a minority -- the continuing , full participation of Commissioners from smaller countries . #% The Commission falls very short of this in the White Paper . #% Other worrying developments are the claims of police brutality made by Falangong practitioners who were refused entry to Macau during the visit of President Jiang and who were also denied the right to protest against the government 's crackdown on the group . #% Obviously I would very much like to see it in non-Union countries as well , where we experience very considerable difficulties , in particular in the North African countries , when children are abducted . #% I understand that it will be very difficult and take time to secure agreement between all the parties involved - our trade partners and everyone else . #% President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon are meeting this week and I hope that this will signal a more willing involvement on the part of the United States to re-intensify its efforts to reach a political agreement in the region . #% This forum will undertake the process of consultation and dialogue on EU policy with the Irish public on matters of concern to them . #% Mr President , I would like to put on record my thanks to the rapporteur for a brilliant report and also to the draftsperson from the Committee on Women 's Rights for her input . #% Committed as I am to rural policies , I now believe they will not achieve their full potential in the absence of integrated national and regional policy . #% In so doing they struck a blow for millions of democrats across Europe , who were denied a say by the totalitarian attempt of the EU elite to foist the Lisbon Treaty on us all . #% I also want to see maximum regional flexibility permitted within the regulation . #% So I refer to the things I do not agree with . #% Every nation owes a duty to provide such services and that duty should not be evaded , or the quality of such services diminished , by allowing them to be provided by the cheapest cowboy source . #% In short , and in conclusion , we must adopt a practical approach which safeguards biodiversity , while , at the same time , acknowledging the professional and commercial role of farmers . #% Approximately 500 women commit suicide in China every day , and yet the report does not say one word about China 's ` one child ' policy , which denies women the right to make real choices in their lives . #% Equally , we need to have budgetary rigour . #% Let us be innovative in the European Union . #% 
A major difficulty arises because of the constraints of the Blair House agreement on export volumes and the level of export refunds payable , together with the collapse of the Russian economy and the strategic downward price pressure which is applied by other third-country markets as they take advantage of the Russian problem . #% We would like to see a successful peace process in Spain also and an end to the use of violence for political ends . #% Mr van Velzen touched on the fact that a lot of SMEs shut down within a year of being set up . #% However , small regional airports are finding it more difficult to compete with larger international airports and as a result there has been an imbalance in the regional development of tourism . #% There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case , and that must be the test . #% If both ends of the chain are operating illegally , we must not only halt all MOX shipments but we must also halt the production of MOX fuel . #% I urge the Commission to continue dialogue with Nigeria under the Cotonou Agreement , to examine the root causes of this conflict and to give every assistance necessary to ensure that these atrocities are not repeated . #% It appears that governments in neutral countries have a tendency to mislead citizens . #% Neutralising that text in the areas of common foreign and security policy , defence cooperation and social policy , stripping out qualified majority voting in relation to these areas and , worst of all , stripping this Parliament of its budgetary prerogatives , is a recipe for defeat . #% We are pleased that the issues of artisanal and local production of traditional products have been taken into account in the common position . #% But you are doing yourselves and this House a disservice by shooting the messenger , which is what you are doing here . #% None of the other minor food-producing species I have mentioned exhibit similar features as the length of the life span , sections of the industry not being oriented towards food production , high monetary value of individual animals and the recreational and sentimental value . #% Madam President , the EPLP delegation voted in favour of the mergers and takeover conciliation text . #% Drugs are a commodity and are being traded on the open market in our towns and cities . #% We live in a world where half a million people move from a rural environment to an urban environment every single week . #% A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once - how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place , and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause . #% In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week , the average being 70 to 80 . #% I believe that tax competition harmonises opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete . #% However , any proposals which are brought forward in this regard , whether it be via the European Commission or otherwise , must be fair and they must be balanced . #% The Conference of Presidents took on board his opinion , as expressed in that letter , that there was nothing to substantiate the allegations made . #% Can she say what information she has , and can she make this information available to us , with regard to the level of development in the different subregions of the country ? #% I am delighted that Mr Mulder is prepared to support us in reinstating the money which was suggested for this action , which many of us on our committee think is important . #% Each manufacturer of new products should cover its own costs , and the collection and treatment of all new products can be done collectively . #% In my country 6 000 people died in 1997 as a direct consequence of smoking . #% We export 90 % of our animals and about 10 % of those , or 200 000 live cattle , are exported every year to markets in France , Italy , Spain and the Netherlands . #% I can not believe that these people have any capacity whatsoever to police their waters or in any way manage their stocks . #% In other words , the Commission should have a department of peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation to go to areas of conflict in advance and apply the principles of conflict resolution , particularly those principles at the heart of European Union itself . #% Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste . #% The NLD has called for Parliament to be convened by 21 August and has also repeatedly called on the military rulers to engage in dialogue . #% Inshore fishermen are very vulnerable to the implications of the designation of Special Areas of Conservation . #% The media , of course , have had a field day , fed by people who should know better , like Ms Lynne . #% in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the work of the rapporteur Edward Scicluna . #% Finally , I fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on Article 5 ( 4 ) . #% I hope that when you are considering it , the provision of a chair for diabetes nurses in one of the Community universities will be one of the priorities for support . #% You have my full respect , President Santer , and my appreciation for what you have done for Europe during your term of office . #% In view of recent developments , notably the massive rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French farming community , who , it must be said , have been one of the main beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy down the years , perhaps the Commissioner could tell us if , in the event that there is no rapid agreement on future financing , there will be a ` plan B ' for rural development #% Indeed , CRAs played a significant role in the build-up to the financial crisis through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments . #% The Council and the Commission also ganged up in an appalling effort to push through the legislation on providing personal data records relating to air transport to the United States , in the face of opposition from the European Parliament . #% I could go to America and back in the same time ! #% The wildly varying climates in the various EU Member States are enough to make it clear that European legislation on natural optical radiation is not appropriate . #% Others have not acted appropriately . #% There are 38 million adults and 2.3 million children living with HIV . #% I support the Commission ' s approach that in future negotiations with third countries , there should be a high percentage of special measures . #% The current minimum standard rate of VAT fixed at 15 % is due to end at the end of this year . #% However , in many of the villages around the cities of my constituency , houses are being thrown up with no thought for utilities , for enough water or sewage , or for the important elements of social infrastructure . #% I want to compliment Mr Bruton the Taoiseach , Mr Spring the Tánaiste and Mr Mitchell all of whom worked extremely hard and contributed immensely to that success . #% Minister Roche deserves a boost after all his work and , most importantly of all , the civil servants deserve not only a good pat on the back , but also perhaps a few extra euros as a result of the new agreements ! #% We have to recognize that as the resources of the European Community have been increased over the years a lot of bad publicity has attached itself to the administration , to the European Commission and to the institutions of the Community generally because of what was perceived as a looseness in the whole administration . #% This has a very negative effect on the economy of future fisheries and on the health of marine ecosystems . #% We can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which is globalising fast . #% in writing . - Transparency of political institutions is a prerequisite for legitimacy . #% The report also deals with many individual countries . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work carried out on this report . #% I would also like to congratulate the staff who are running the Daphne Programme . #% This must not be used as a stick to beat the industry . #% The part that European farmers can play in this will come into clearer focus in the ongoing debate on the future shape of the CAP post-2013 and it is essential that the EU assists our farmers in striking this balance . #% I am sure the President-in-Office will also be aware of the potential impact of the WTO on an eventual CAP agreement . #% The debate boils down to the powers of the EU institutions versus the competence of Member States . #% We have not yet achieved as much as we should have done for those people . #% Scientifically , it is totally wrong to split a TAC , and that is not just my personal opinion . #% Currently , VAT rates on food in some Member States are prohibitive and need to be looked at urgently . #% Our Group also naturally considers it important that the renewed request should be dealt with both expeditiously and in full accordance with the proper procedures laid down in the Treaty . #% Member States need to be realistic in recognising that the introduction of a common tax base is simply the thin edge of the wedge towards tax harmonisation . #% As a result , they enjoy lower pensions later in life . #% But I must say from my understanding of what happened in Hong Kong that enormous pressure was exerted on the European model of agriculture at those talks , all in the name of helping developing countries . #% Who do they want to replace him with ? #% 
I believe that Ireland was one of a number of countries who opposed the directive after it passed through Parliament in 1999 on the grounds that it might make ferry services to peripheral regions uneconomic to run . #% While we understand the needs and requirements of many in the ten new Member States , it is of little comfort to those who will lose out substantially . #% In simple terms , if you want to put a whaleback on a vessel to protect the crew and create a safer environment , you are now penalised . #% Therefore , I believe we have set out in the wrong direction and I so not support the basic proposal that because there is stringency at national level , it should be applied here . #% The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth . #% However , Commissioner , you did not answer the basic aspects of the question . #% I believe that EU Enlargement will help to build a more effective European Union . #% Now , however , after the experience we have gained , we can look at this more closely . #% Only in this way can fact rather than fiction govern our decisions on food law and food safety in the future . #% The real route to cohesion was equality of access to funding , but that was denied to Northern Ireland , while the south of Ireland benefited to the tune of over EUR 2 billion for its infrastructure . #% . It was my predecessor , Philip Whitehead , who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers . #% We call on the Council and the Commission to make financial assistance available if a civil case proceeds . #% TOTAL , the French state-owned oil company , has been active in Burma for many years and there have been allegations that it has used forced labour , including child labour , in its work . #% Mr President , this is like a TV quiz show - I am getting different advice from each side . #% Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Roth . #% I would point out to the British proponents of the original urgency motion that their own Labour Government was the most vociferous when the German Government recently mooted the introduction of a harmonised tax system in the European Union . #% He is now subject to emergency regulations , which constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment , even though he has served his sentence -- incidentally for revealing details of the kind of weapons that the US is seeking to discover in Iraq . #% Madam President , I would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and thank him for the communication on the broad guidelines to economic policy . #% The support provided by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is urgently needed by the workers , their families and the North Dublin community , deeply affected by the closure of this company , which brought the loss of more than a thousand skilled jobs . #% I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how , by making the wrong decisions , governments can strengthen terrorist organisations . #% On what authority ? #% Against the background of the recent recovery , any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth . #% But , obviously , Mr Rothley is still dealing with his onerous task of the Statute for Members and so on . #% I would argue that , having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe , if we are to create European citizens , we must have services of general interest universally available , accessible , affordable and of high quality . #% If there was , it would have been found by now . #% In a number of cases , women who live near incinerators were told not to breast-feed their babies because of the amount of dioxins in their breast milk . #% In particular , we need to be vigilant where workers are exposed to dangers and to risks and where they are less well represented by trade unions . #% I would just like to finish by saying that the report itself is excellent and I hope that it gets full support . #% Therefore , contrary to the opinion of the Commissioner for research , the EU does not have the right to overrule national legislation , regulations and ethical guidelines or to insist that Member States have a duty to draw up regulations in the field of embryo research . #% Enactment of legislation under Article 23 has raised such concerns . #% in writing . - I welcome this report which is the first step in examining the shape and nature of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) post 2013 . #% Heaven help us if we have a human pandemic and see how stretched our health-care services will be worldwide . #% The EU-15 is dependent on Middle East countries for 31 % of oil imports , on Russia for 30 % of gas imports and 28 % of oil imports , and on Algeria for 22 % of gas imports . #% Parents need to be aware of some of these issues before they marry or before they create children . #% There is no reason to assume that the same majority , or more , would not obtain , if the Commissioner had a study and allowed the Ecofin ministers to look at the issue again in a clear and factual way . #% At present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity . #% To even suggest that amends might be made through such summary justice indicates what few lessons , if any , have been learnt by the IRA over the past 30 years . #% In December , North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material . #% Regarding the issue of cloning , I would have been happier with the original Amendment No 38 , but there are sufficient safeguards included in this compromise . #% The improvement in Ireland 's position is welcome and is a tribute to the successful implementation of our stabilization policies over a number of governments and to the productive use which has been made of the EU structural funds , which have has enabled us to make our economy grow . #% Would this damage European Union science and , most importantly of all , would it damage the prospects of helping people who are suffering from terrible diseases ? #% With regard to the role of national governments , these and other reforms are badly needed . #% In many cases companies use the argument of negligence rather than saying it is deliberate but in fact negligence in its way is deliberate . #% The United States , as a free market capitalist society , is very keen on intervention to help its industries . #% What I said in reply to the question was that the expenditure commitment ceiling in Heading 3 , internal policies , will be raised by ECU 1 billion over the period 1997-1999 and will be mainly intended for priority transport infrastructure networks . #% After ten years and one previous rejection we still have not got it right . #% We must strengthen our diplomatic actions in relation to Burma by prohibiting investment or loans to all state-owned companies , not just those already banned . #% That is why I particularly welcome the decision to have two capitals of culture operating in the east and west , as it were , of the continent . #% Nevertheless , these amendments encourage research on other promising and non-controversial stem cell research such as adult and cord blood . #% The technical measures are all about trying to increase the selectivity of EU fishing practices . #% We want to have a deal that has everyone on board but not at any price . #% Even where they are , what will it take to get us out of our cars ? #% May I inform the House that this is an issue which has been very strongly raised by the Danish Foreign Minister and with me personally when we had occasion to meet recently in Sweden . #% In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology . #% It is not just about lack of social security protection . #% I also want to thank the Commissioner for having tidied the whole matter up and made what was certainly an unacceptable situation a bit more acceptable in these renegotiations . #% It was only last summer that the Israeli government and the Palestinian people were negotiating on what were bottom-line issues . #% It is a travesty for these people to describe the one great peace movement of Europe , which is the European integration process , as heading towards militarisation . #% Since the disaster in November 2002 , the issues of European maritime security and safety have been given a much higher priority on the European agenda . #% How do you win an election ? #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to add my thanks to Mrs Roth-Berendt and indeed Mr Böge for their commitment to this important issue . #% Mr President , the Council proposals liberalizing airport groundhandling services could actually have very serious consequences for jobs and safety at the airport in my own constituency , Dublin , and indeed at other major airports throughout Europe , as has been mentioned by other speakers . #% I also welcome the recently submitted draft plan for the police structure reform as it lays down a balanced allocation of responsibilities at all levels , while ensuring transparency in selection of police chiefs and officers and for monitoring their work . #% But let us look beyond the borders of the European Union . #% We are all members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and we will be led by our colleague , Mr Blokland , as our vice-chairman . #% We give tax incentives for machines and we put payroll taxes on employment . #% 
It is surely clear as we enter a new millennium that Europe is not and can not be a rigid unification but rather a rich diversification . #% There must be flexibility . #% I am quite amazed at the Commissioner 's answer . #% Mr President , let me , at the outset say that our group is entirely in favour of Mr Pirker 's report . #% Worse than that , if we got it wrong in July , we might want a second bite of the cherry next January and act more vigorously then than need be . #% For instance , how do the British people like the idea of trains carrying nuclear materials continuing to run through London and other cities in Britain ? #% SMEs in particular seem to be split on this issue . #% In a report designed to assess and support our young people in the best possible way , the deletion of reference to the family , the single most important influence in a young person ' s life , is incomprehensible . #% The number of people living in poverty has increased dramatically . #% I should have spoken earlier on , but we will deal with that later . #% A strongly funded common agricultural policy will protect Europe 's food security , contribute to our climate change targets and maintain employment in our rural communities . #% The numbers of patients will be far in excess of the doctors available , who are mostly male . #% If we really want to get people 's backs up and alienate young people from the European Union , that would be the way to go ! #% Fontainebleau was Margaret Thatcher 's Agincourt , when she walked away with the British rebate , and now , 20 years on , that rebate is worth a farthing in the pound of British GDP . #% It preserves the wording of the architects directive , which is part of the , and would ensure continuity of understanding in the way this provision is interpreted under the new system . #% The proposal was ill-conceived and can only destroy confidence in the whole farming industry . #% The Irish electorate are making it clear that they will not be patronised or taken for granted by the political leaders and governments of the Member States , or by Brussels . #% It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security . #% Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling ? #% I believe , as does my constituent , that a revamp of the website is needed , with , where possible , real-life cases that have been solved by SOLVIT . #% My second area of concern is the lack of real democratic control over what is negotiated on our behalf by the Commission . #% Kuwait encroached on Iraqi oilfields and the US Ambassador gave the Iraqi Government the impression that the US would not object to an invasion . #% In Ireland , such statements quite simply polarise the debate about whether we defend the nation or build Europe . #% We should not ignore the reality that a vibrant , commercial and sustainable farm sector is a vital component of rural life . #% With regard to the effects of radiation on human beings , here we have an important breakthrough due to the work of Dr Mothersill in Ireland and the UK Medical Research Council team of Dr Eric Wright on genomic instability . #% They voted in favour of all of these things because they wish to continue supporting them . #% The pace of reform is the main issue . #% We can not hope to closely examine every injury but we should and must create a system of data collection that more closely examines the injury determinants of all fatal and seriously disabling injuries , to prevent them more effectively in the future . #% Finally , I would say that in the new Europe it is going to be important for farmers to base their levels of production on the projected quantities that will be produced in the Union . #% I do not have to say any more . #% Furthermore this routine also required me coming regularly to Strasbourg on a Sunday for which I received no daily allowance . #% The reform of the common agricultural policy is very controversial . #% I realise that a number of amendments which are good amendments in their own right are going to be rejected here tomorrow , but the Commission and Council should bear in mind that they are being rejected in order to facilitate this agreement , not because we disagree with them . #% Scientific testing must be specific , in this case for children , and must be updated . #% This article should not be changed or watered down into a Trojan horse to halt or hold back the process of the completion of the internal market . #% Mr President , I wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister for his willingness to engage with Parliament every Question Time and for his part-answer to my question . #% The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time . #% I have therefore included in the report a call for legislation to ensure meat and bonemeal is never again used in ruminant feeds and that ruminant feeds can not be produced on any premises where meat and bonemeal is present . #% I should also like to stress that the information technologies should not create greater regional and social disparities : they should contribute to reducing such disparities . #% This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity . #% Since we know that the debate on such vast and sensitive issues will be difficult and the time is now running out , I want to inform the Council and the Commission that the Committee on Development is setting up a working group to discuss the policy content . #% This would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship . #% The long term EU budget should also follow the agreed so-called EU 2020 strategic objectives , especially our internationally binding climate objectives . #% The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years . #% Somehow the reviewers seem to get funded . #% As Mr Sakellariou said , there is no justification in international law for the invasion and occupation of a country to change the regime in that country . #% Those who believe that agriculture is oversubsidised should take note of the continuing decline in the number of farm families and ask themselves why this is happening . #% We should be limiting export on the hoof . #% This is a resolution driven by those consumed by a fanatical desire to usurp national authority and status . #% The IRA stands exposed by the Dublin Justice Minister as deeply implicated in organised crime centred on Dublin port . #% We need to redress the balance between economic policies and social policies by providing for a social audit of all European Union policies . #% I support the part of the report that states , in Amendment 17 , that we must insist on the same standards in third countries as in the European Union . #% Madam President , I want to draw to your attention and that of the House the fact that Jimmy Goldsmith 's Referendum Party in Britain has provided # 150 , 000 to the Ulster Unionist Party . #% From my own experience and my Green perspective , this is a very effective way to deal with these funds and can be more effective than national administration . #% The European Commission , as guardian of the Treaties , must do everything possible to ensure that the idea of a two-speed Europe does not gather momentum . #% But it is right that we should . #% I will highlight just three issues . #% My country , Ireland , has seen a very welcome reversal in its economic fortunes over the past five years but even our `` Celtic Tiger ' suffers from the cancer of unemployment . #% We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission , as has been called for by so many in civil society . #% Ionising radiation transfers energy at levels that can induce changes in any matter it penetrates and even cause irreversible damage to human cells . #% One of the keys to making progress in this area is to have affirmative programmes , action plans and targets . #% Mr President , could we be assured that the Minister will also take on board the question regarding an amendment to the Treaty protecting the rights of children ? #% I am constantly visiting little workshops where people who used to work for big IT firms like Alcatel have gone off on their own and have decided to use their ideas - a huge growth area . #% In fact many people , as we can see from the low turnouts , no longer define themselves in political terms and therefore disengage from the political process . #% Was it the condition or type of vehicle ; was the victim the driver , a passenger or someone walking along the road ; were drink , speed or bad weather conditions involved ; what was the road like ? #% On top of that , we must also put greater emphasis on a uniform inspection system across all European Union waters and give more powers to the Community inspectors to ensure that all regulations are being properly enforced . #% 
I was going up and down in the lift when the doors jammed and I could hardly get here in time for the debate . #% We must do all in our power to work with the many leaders and spokespersons in the Arab world who feel as strongly as we do in the West about these atrocities . #% The President-in-Office has said that they are only allegations but there is a lot of information and data to back them up . #% But from what you have said , that is not the case . #% Ireland 's failure so far to ratify these ground rules serves only to strengthen the anti-European Union sentiment in the candidate countries , to the detriment of all Europeans . #% I understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3 % in the European Union and 2.1 % in the euro area in 2006 , up from 1.6 % and 1.3 % respectively in 2005 . #% 37 Members of my Committee have signed a recommendation , on my own advice , to refer this proposal back for amendment . #% Other amendments seek to ensure that the granting of a patent does not allow monopoly or abuse of a dominant position . #% It is my experience that the Independent Newspaper Group , in which these comments appeared , does not accept clarifications or corrections from those of us who do not agree with its political line . #% We have had the Delors plan for the unemployed . #% They are all denied by the IRA , by word and by deed , on a regular basis . #% It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position . #% It is about their families and their families ' futures , their way of life -- the only one possible in many areas -- and the future of entire coastal communities . #% Contrast this with the developing world , where 26 % of avoidable deaths are caused by tuberculosis . #% We find it incredible that so many MEPs would reject measures to ensure that public health is protected . #% We know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers . #% This is not just an Irish or a British problem : the grey squirrel has established a firm foothold in Italy and is spreading rapidly northwards across our continent towards France , Germany and Austria , and it is bringing devastation in its wake . #% Mr President , it is now exactly 20 years since I was lucky enough to get speaking time on my first day in Parliament . #% I find that very frustrating . #% Madam President , we made arrangements that Irish would be interpreted . #% Clearly this technology is not new , nor is it unique , and patenting of software business methods such as this is not good for innovation and competition . #% I believe that the importance of bees within agriculture , in broad terms , is generally undervalued , even within the sector itself . #% That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were . #% I seriously hope that the committee 's final recommendations will be fully reflected in the forthcoming legislative proposal . #% I hope Mrs de Palacio that you will state here today that you wish to see compliance in full with the recommendations and swiftly , because that is what I want to hear . #% I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso González on her excellent report . #% If democracy and human rights were functioning in our Member States , then we would not have children going to school on bread and jam , and that is the reality of it . #% In introducing a general clause on fair trading , the detail of the directive will be vital if it is to work for the benefit of consumers and not to be perceived by businesses as more red tape and bureaucracy . #% The fact that there are so many diverse views and divisions amongst scientists must surely bring home to us legislators that this is not a clear-cut issue . #% It is a fact that the treatment you get for epilepsy depends on where you live , and there is a huge problem with the lack of neurologists in some Member States . #% The summit in Dublin this weekend must address the key issues confronting the Union at the present time and set down guidelines for the work of the institutions on these issues for 1997 . #% This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem . #% And while we are planning our own compensation package , remember third countries like Mauritius which are being devastated by our sugar reform . #% Iceland can export fisheries produce to the EU tariff-free . #% It must be one of the priorities of the European Union to tackle drugs . #% There was no heavy equipment when we were there yesterday . #% Mr President , it is important that the European Parliament makes its views known on the deteriorating human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea . #% - Mr President , Members will be aware that the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , as indeed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , was dominated by the concerns we had about the legal basis which was used , which only provides for consultation with Parliament . #% The LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages : killing the adults , taking the children . #% Migrants and people from more marginalised communities are also more likely to work in a domestic situation . #% These totally unacceptable conditions not only undermine the health of our junior doctors , they also undermine our health care system and endanger the patient . #% Most of our higher quality proteins , for example Brazilian soya , are shipped vast distances from countries where the sustainability debate is now raging . #% The other point I should like to make is that so many people , by connecting these outbreaks of disease with the common agricultural policy , tend to somehow blame the CAP for the problem . #% The test ban alone only serves to export the problem as cosmetics tested on animals in countries outside the EU will continue to be sold in the EU . #% This should be rethought in the interests of the overall talks , because I believe agriculture will always be a problem . #% Ireland is a nuclear-free country and must remain so . #% The reality , and I think the cause of the frustration that many dairy farmers feel , is that while they have seen to some extent what Mr Lyon referred to as the green shoots emerging , this money has not passed through into their bank accounts yet . #% In addition to CAP support and measures , an allocation of IEP 80m has been provided in the regional operational programme for investment in harvesting equipment , forest roads and general woodland improvements . #% I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service . #% This applies very strongly to the points on the black rhinoceros and the leopard . #% In Northern Ireland it has been discovered by the largest transport operation called Translink that 60 % of black smoke and 40 % of carbon monoxide has been wiped out by using this product . #% The proposed amendments are not justified in terms of environmental benefits and associated costs and other impacts and would disturb the balance achieved . #% The members of the international Quartet , namely the European Union , Russia , the United States and the United Nations , are all committed to this roadmap plan . #% These areas deal with mobility , transparency , publicity and support to researchers and potential researchers . #% Then they warned them not to cooperate with the authorities . #% Thirdly , it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise , we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers ' money . #% It is correctly suggested in one of the amendments that we legislate for acceptable feeding regimes for the cattle whose meat is imported . #% In Ireland smoking kills six times as many people per year as road accidents , work accidents , murder , drugs , suicide and Aids combined . #% - There is a framework decision on this issue still with the Council of Ministers . #% The enlargement of the Union is an economic and political opportunity for Europe . #% The politics of the Western Sahara issue is complex and I want to focus my remarks primarily on human rights , although , obviously , there is a crossover between the two . #% Mr President , as Mr De Rossa has pointed out it is expected that the Seville Summit will discuss the holding of a second Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice . #% Public information campaigns must be supported both within Ireland and the European Union , because prevention is the best cure in such matters . #% I would like to place on record that on this day we reverently honour the Jewish victims of Auschwitz and the other victims , but it should be put in very bold letters that the disabled were there from beginning to end and were killed for no other reason than that they were not perfect , which is what Hitler 's Reich was looking for . #% Only last weekend I read in the Irish media that the head of the Commission 's Environment DG , Mr Curry , complained to Ireland 's EU Ambassador , Mr Denis O'Leary , last autumn that the Irish authorities were not cooperating adequately with Brussels on environmental issues . #% Those of us who participated in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty had hoped that Europol would be the agency which would provide national authorities with the intelligence and information on money laundering , illegal drug production and smuggling , which they required to prosecute those responsible for the drugs being distributed to our communities . #% 
If we are to engender consumer confidence , then we must ensure that there are no loopholes for defective or dangerous products . #% Unfortunately , the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations . #% Despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry , including an attempt to say the process is illegal , the European Parliament will stand firm on public health . #% We have created that barrier not just between the people but between ourselves and the media , on whom we depend to sell our message to the people of Europe . #% Speaking for myself , I can say that the Committee on Budgets has its responsibilities . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos for the report they have presented to us today . #% ( Applause ) I would ask the Commissioner in fairness to withdraw his remarks on the European Parliament finding itself unanimous in only one respect , namely in opposing the Commission . #% The Court of Auditors , in this particular report , has drawn attention to the weaknesses in the basic regulations , weaknesses which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to effectively control spending . #% I would ask Commissioner Flynn , who is with us here today , where he stands on this issue . #% The European Union must aim for greater coordination of employment policies and a growthorientated macro-economic policy . #% The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement , while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement . #% However , no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum . #% Secondly , a mechanism must be put in place that better monitors adherence to the human rights clause , so that breaches of the clause have a range of real consequences for the overall agreement . #% I support further research into the effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields on public health and hope that the 1999 recommendation will be reviewed and updated . #% You say that the Treaty has to be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements of Member States . #% . I welcome this report , which formally gives the backing of the European Parliament to continued EU funding for the European Peace Fund until the year 2006 . #% Might I suggest to President Simitis that I could recommend no place better than Platy Yialos and he would know what I mean when I say that . #% As we stand on the threshold of launching this irreversible project , it is important to take stock of some of the unresolved issues . #% Mr President , the resolution by the Green Group was tabled first . #% In this most sensitive and critically important area of Member State budgetary policy and Stage 3 of monetary union it is important , we believe , that it be placed firmly and belong institutionally at the heart of the first pillar . #% Let us be clear : without this directive , patents will continue to be filed . #% There are social , political and economic factors that must be considered before we reach conclusions . #% The International Criminal Court affords us the opportunity to ensure that not only captured prisoners or the lowest of the service people involved in conflicts , but also generals and heads of state can be brought to justice for genocide and for crimes against humanity . #% The United Nations is organising an international appeal for humanitarian and other aid . #% The liberalization of electricity directive is one big reason why there will not be investment in nuclear power in Western Europe . #% Initiatives by the international community , focused on obtaining a political settlement , must ensure that human rights issues are addressed at every stage of the peace and democratisation process . #% Secondly , they do not have the same access to training which would allow them to keep up with the new technologies , with new economic forecasting to enable them to be competitive within the main markets . #% Today I voted against the amended proposal and legislative resolution on REACH because , as the votes progressed , amendments to ease the burden on SMEs were generally lost . #% Eventual Turkish membership would demonstrate the ability of western democracy and culture to co-exist and fully cooperate with the Islamic world . #% More and more flights and lower air fares have improved Ireland 's attractiveness as a holiday destination and Irish tourism is performing very well . #% The sense of consensus is to be welcomed . #% The citizens of Europe are always reaffirming their demands for a Europe that is much closer to them and this should not exclude the level of governance closest to the people . #% The most important aspects of improving the service relate , in my opinion , to the training of personnel , as well as clear and coherent guidelines for operators across the sector . #% Finally , and not for the first time , I want to express my concern about research on human embryos . #% Finally , the expiry of the ECSC Treaty after 50 years reminds us that the Euratom Treaty , which has also existed outside the democratic scrutiny and control of this Parliament , is an anomaly as more and more Member States are moving away from nuclear energy and towards new forms of energy and that this anomaly , which happily will end with the Coal and Steel Community , still continues with the Euratom Treaty . #% As far as helping Russia itself is concerned , there can be no more financial aid without a genuine commitment to economic and political reform . #% The political and economic reunification of our continent is a victory for the spirit of Europe , one of which we should all be proud . #% I can see the benefits of introducing tax incentives to motorists to purchase vehicles with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency . #% I wish you and the Irish Government well with the very onerous agenda which it falls to you to push forward . #% In Ireland over the last eight months something in the region of 24 million euros ' worth of illegal substances was seized by police and customs officers , in Britain 82 million euros ' worth and across the rest of the European Union 297 million euros ' worth . #% So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious . #% But this issue , concerning the physical , psychological and physiological safety of the Union 's children must be seen by our citizens to command a priority position on the Union 's agenda . #% The Member States must primarily have the role to respond to Member States ' needs , but collectively the European Union , as a region , is very weak in dealing with this problem . #% If Sellafield sinks we will all sink with it . #% I also agree that the legal basis is clearer under Art. 175 ( 1 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and support the rapporteur . #% Mr President , US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran . #% But failure to act at all would be downright catastrophic . #% Guantánamo is in this category . #% Sanctions hurt the citizens , as has been said already here . #% What I despise most is the false pretence , particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom , that this Constitution is merely a tidying-up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generations . #% The people of Europe recognise that they are protesting not against America , but against President Bush and against war . #% That is not going to be easy by any means , in particular when one considers the levels of violence that we have all witnessed in the Middle East in recent times . #% We must explore the possibility of additional farm production to manufacture products separately for the growing world market without export refund or other cost to the EU budget . #% I do not want to see any more people buried in my country on either side . #% If we in Europe do not take up market opportunities in the Middle East and elsewhere , our competitors from Australia and New Zealand will ship their animals half way around the world to meet that particular demand . #% In the light of the mayhem of communal strife , street violence , intimidation , murder and bombing which has returned to Northern Ireland , unfortunately , in the past 10 days , I want first of all to place on record my group 's utter condemnation of that descent towards the abyss . #% Could you please define these measures , provide an estimate of the total cost of them , specify how they could be applied and outline the criteria for the allocation of these yet undefined measures ? #% We have the moral , ethical and political duty to act . #% This point should not be forgotten , especially if Milosevic fails to honour the US-brokered agreement and comply with UN security resolutions in letter and in spirit . #% I fully support the prosecution of such crime while ensuring that the freedoms and legal rights of individuals are protected . #% Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age . #% While it is still on the first reading , there is a possibility of introducing amendments at the further stages . #% In conclusion , I believe that much can be learned from an exchange of views between Member States on energy policy , and I support Mr Chichester ' s call for the Commission to highlight examples of best practice in integrating environmental objectives in the energy policy . #% In the present programme Ireland is assessed as a single unit for funding . #% I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community . #% We have to look at these issues and decide that these countries should not be allowed to operate in this way . #% 
If you look at the stocking rate you will find that if you replace the four or five ewes with one cow - which is the equivalent stocking rate - it will be more expensive to stock this land with cows and you will be producing a product of which there is a one-and-ahalf million tonne surplus . #% The European Commission has proposed a budget of over EUR 200 million for the administration of the EU Erasmus World initiative for the years 2004 to 2008 . #% I believe the vast majority holds this view because of the influence of scare stories and theories which are completely without scientific foundation . #% In that time I have dealt with 12 cases and almost daily requests for information and for help . #% This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe , not militarisation . #% On the issue of radioactive substances , during the debate in the committee the Commission representative said that it was `` implicit '' but we want it to be explicit . #% It is about time the Commission clipped the wings of British Nuclear Fuels ' nuclear ambitions as it expands its empire to the United States . #% I , and my group , can not support doubling the EU budget in one area without a commitment to showing where that money can come from elsewhere . #% The current healthy state of the Irish economy , including a labour market which has increased by 10 % over the last 5 years , has meant that our dependency ratio is actually improving . #% Well done , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Duff 's report . #% I say to the Council that I expected more . #% Any new conservation measures which are introduced at European Union level must be brought about in consultation with all interested parties involved in all Member States in order to protect what is a very valuable natural resource for all of us . #% This is an important factor in her report . #% Alas , I think that for Ireland it will mean that we will have no industry at all . #% However , the aid sent from the European Union and other donor countries is a mere token , given the scale of the destruction and suffering , and particularly in view of a statistic mentioned by Mr Howitt : almost half a million people have lost their homes and their belongings . #% What will happen , who will compensate people if there is an accident , if there is a disaster involving fisheries , tourism or any other issue ? #% In the same letter I received from my constituent , your office said that there are a range of measures that the Commission has at its disposal to deal with any threat to employment . #% The economic and environment benefits are obvious . #% The final point I want to make relates to the most recent special report , which is a rarity -- special reports from the Ombudsman are a rarity -- relating to the need for the Council to meet in public when making law . #% European policy from now on concerning Israel , the Palestinian Authority and Hamas must be predicated on the movement by them without delay into serious final status negotiations based on the Quartets Roadmap and the Arab Peace Initiative . #% I do not wish to repeat all the comments made on the situation in Northern Ireland , but I believe it is important to realize that events there in recent days are an offence against the European ideal . #% We in the EU put a lot on the table in the interests of developing countries in the area of agriculture , market access and so on . #% The decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and the whole story of demand side management can not be ignored . #% I take this opportunity to say to my dear colleagues from all parties in the Netherlands : your policies have tended to become like a honeypot for the criminal element in many of the accession countries . #% I fully support this proposal and would like to commend Mr Rothley for his work in bringing these proposals to this stage . #% Ms Herczog 's report recognises the work done by the Commission and calls for further steps in this direction . #% If we had an equivalent to the Euratom Treaty - I would call it the Eurenew Treaty , a treaty on renewable energy - we could do something . #% Members speak of between 90 days and 42 days , but some extradition proceedings that would have gone on for years between Member States of the European Union in the past have now been reduced to 42 days . #% They are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources , even to regions where they have never been used or produced . #% ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand , but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands , and this is the problem . #% The markets are reasonably stable and the Berlin ceilings are not threatened . #% Mr President , first of all I should like as usual to congratulate Mr Telkämper . #% It makes no sense for Parliament to duplicate the work of the Council . #% It is unfair , disingenuous and indeed misleading to say that those who oppose funding for stem cell research are preventing the discovery of cures for serious illnesses . #% Why do we not bring that regulation forward immediately and not have our hands forced ? #% I intend to use the additional assistance allowance to provide opportunities to young students who are applying in large numbers to my office for work . #% If this is the way Council and the Fisheries Committee are going to continue they are basically proving correct the cynics and all those who said that the reform of the common fisheries policy was not going to see any achievable result in relation to sustainable fishing . #% Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community . #% Is that the kind of future we want for our own coastal communities ? #% In the resolution tabled today by my political group , we stress that there must be sound management in the administration of all EU programmes and initiatives . #% I think it was 16 May last year , the time of the first reading . #% This is a first step in ensuring that countries in Northern Europe , such as the UK and Ireland , are not discriminated against in the framework of a new classification system . #% Parliament will support the Commission and make sure it is not sidelined by one or two of the larger Member States wishing to do so for any particular reason . #% I would also like to pay tribute to Ireland 's public service which , though relatively small in number , has managed to rise to the challenge of preparing and coping with the presidency and , in many instances , chairing many of the 2 , 000 and more meetings that are part and parcel of the work of the presidency . #% If you can not see the role of the Commission as a body that can transcend national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum , then we are wasting our time here . #% Even though the rights of children are not enshrined in the Treaty yet -- and we hope this will come eventually -- we now have several pieces of excellent legislation that should ensure the safety and rights of these children to know both their parents in the event of a marital breakdown . #% This was a really dishonest question , because the funds go into the reserve and they are used for purposes such as HIV . #% They had to send for someone in the Commission . #% Neither Father Cullen nor his colleague were given adequate medical treatment in police custody and both had to be taken for medical treatment at a later stage . #% Do I gather then , that the reason we are doing it is because it is good for civil servants ? #% Irish People , along with all Europeans live with the constant concern that an accident in the UK or France or a collision in the Irish Sea , could have devastating and immediate effects on us all . #% SOLVIT is a means of righting these wrongs and assisting national administrations in ensuring the correct implementation and transposition of the legislation that we pass together in the European Union . #% From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process . #% In conclusion , these are astonishing statistics which I am confident this Parliament will continue to work to reduce . #% We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more . #% Will it bring it to the attention of the French presidency ? #% I did meet with his colleague , Mrs Kinnock , earlier today and she gave me an up-to-date report on her visit there and I am also making a note of the comments he has made from his visit there . #% There are great hopes riding on the Ariane Programme , particularly in countries where minority languages are increasingly being used by our young writers and among the small publishers who have the courage to publish these books , knowing that they will probably make no money on them and , even worse , might possibly lose money on them . #% We owe it to our European passengers to increase our knowledge and science in this area . #% I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world . #% The new law will save many lives and optimise the organs donated by allowing Member States to share organs . #% The World Bank has done excellent work on this . #% I particularly support the compromise agreement reached on the sensitive issue of stem cell research , both adult and embryonic . #% We have to think about this . #% Thank you , Mr President , and Happy Christmas ! #% 
I really think that people should be extremely cautious . #% With regard to derivatives , I support the timely call for the Commission to present a report on their role on the capital markets . #% Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one . #% Very often , delays also occur in relation as the report mentions - to the circumstances of the death . #% We should intervene with the Security Council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people . #% We must all recall that the European Parliament has the power of codecision on environmental matters as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% An opinion , Commissioner , rather than a recommendation . #% It is not a question of subsidiarity : trans-frontier pollution is a matter of concern to us all and has prompted numerous petitions . #% The US and the WTO will continue to insist that science , not sentiment , and scientific measurement , in particular , be the yardstick which determines food quality and food safety . #% - I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said . #% Mr President , there are economic frontiers within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time . #% In other words , they failed to answer the question . #% Switzerland is the only European country to take part in these programmes without being a member of the EEA , a candidate or a potential candidate country . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the work of the rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , and the Committee in ensuring that the European Parliament will have a role in supervising developments in this very technical and difficult field . #% However , I am pleased that , in this House at least , we are going in the right direction even if some countries , like my own , are dragging their heels . #% It is now proposed to complement this first initiative with a new directive that would address both mandatory and confidential reporting of incidents , defects or malfunctions which may constitute a hazard for civil aviation operations , called `` occurrences '' . #% Up to 60 such cases are currently being brought against writers by the State Prosecutor . #% Without designated , ring-fenced funding specifically earmarked for the environment , we will not achieve our environmental policy objectives . #% We need to avoid this for future programmes . #% The other questionable aspect of the report is the whole issue of wanting the Commission to promote aquaculture . #% Failure on the part of some Member State governments to cooperate fully in updating and reporting ` new data ' is unnecessary and only has the effect of undermining attempts to implement effective control programmes as envisaged in the Kyoto protocol . #% Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised . #% Ireland may therefore have to withdraw from Sfor because a UN mandate will not now exist if this veto persists . #% I congratulate Mr Moraes and I welcome the report 's assertion that equal treatment is a basic right and not a privilege , that human rights are indivisible and can not be bought or sold . #% I fully support the view that is necessary to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaties of the Union , so as to further enhance the rights of citizens of Europe . #% He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery . #% I hope there will be a follow-up to the Science White Paper . #% We have seen that in recent days . #% Those seeds are certainly not your family 's variation ; they are an identikit Monsanto seed of a particular batch number , exactly the same seed as millions of others around the globe . #% Our task and role today is to listen to our Estonian colleagues and to hear their cries and their pleas for assistance and solidarity . #% There is sufficient evidence that our competitors in the world market , particularly the United States and New Zealand , are not always as committed to adhering to the rules as are the EU Member States . #% Thus , the Commission , by means of Directives 92/73 and 92/74 , created a legal framework allowing patients access to the products of their choice while providing precautions to ensure the quality and safety of the products . #% As far as Kyoto is concerned , there are only three things you can do in order to diminish CO2 emissions : one is to rely on nuclear energy - but there are very big risks and problems involved in that ; secondly , you use energy more rationally and , thirdly , you turn to renewable energy sources . #% Finally , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether there will be another proposal from the Commission with regard to copyright and related rights in the information society in the near future ? #% The selective use of genetic research would assist in developing my country 's green image and lead to a reduction in the use of fertilizers and pesticides . #% Furthermore , the local development programme in Ireland is a partnership , first of all between the European Union and the state , and secondly between the state and the social partners : business , trade unions and the rural area 's farmers . #% We can not have the most powerful state on this earth , which regards itself as militarily invincible , deciding which target it chooses to attack , which to disarm and how and when it will launch such an attack . #% I should like to point out that the name indicated as signing for the Liberal Group , the Lord Bethell , is most welcome to join our Group . #% We should export on the hook and not the hoof . #% At the very least , we should name and shame those States that are failing to invest in health services that can save lives if they are properly applied . #% So any positive efforts we make on climate change will impact positively on food production . #% We would , of course , have had to leave aside a lot of the self-justification that we all tend to engage in on all sides . #% I appeal for honesty in the presentation of this Constitution , for recognition that it is a charter designed to facilitate and build a European superstate with ever-diminishing national powers and ever-increasing centralised powers and all the apparatus of statehood . #% I should like to draw your attention to paragraph 9 , which says that Parliament ` believes that the Members of the European Parliament who are part of the EC delegation have an essential contribution to make and expects , therefore , that they will have access to EU coordination meetings in Punta del Este on the basis at least of observer status ' . #% The men and women involved in the inshore fisheries sector are calling on you to consider a new Community approach . #% However , in the interim , there needs to be an international agreement outlining the safety standards for such shipments . #% Lets go for real debt relief , that is cancellation of their debts . #% Harassing and interrogating Members at the doorways coming into this House are against the rules . #% The options for decoupling direct payments will allow these payments to be made safe from WTO challenges and so protect their contribution to farm incomes and to the rural economy . #% I am therefore glad that the accession states are being spared this lunacy . #% A few amendments were accepted at committee and I would urge the Commission to indicate that it would take them on board . #% The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration . #% They prepared a boat for them and they would not even go out in the boat . #% The final package negotiated by Commissioner Pinheiro and endorsed by the full Commission is the basis of a solid partnership for trade , development and technical cooperation . #% I urge the Commissioner to ask the authorities to take up the offer of assistance by the UK to interview witnesses and examine pre - and post-trial evidence that was rejected in his appeal . #% In the Council of Ministers the unanimity rule must be removed in almost all areas . #% I very much hope that the Middle East will resume peace talks in the near future . #% We want to see the expansion of 24-hour hotlines and electronic watchtowers . #% I did so in the belief that this would have restricted research to stem cells extracted from the human embryo ( i.e. the embryo has already been destroyed ) prior to 31.12.2003 and that new human embryos could not be created and then destroyed for research purposes . #% Since the EU relishes and promotes cross-border infrastructural projects within its own territory , would it not be incongruous and wrong for it to object to such a project in Israel , since improved communication links can only bring cohesion and social and economic betterment to those disparate territories ? #% Finally , there is an absolute need for positive discrimination towards women in the political system by political parties at all levels , particularly at candidate selection level . #% The goal of admitting new members into the European Union by 2004 is still a very ambitious one , but it is not a pipe dream . #% We can not support the identification and traceability amendments because this is a matter for DG V , not because we do not support the principle but because it is for another DG , and for that reason solely . #% The first part was supposed to last 30 minutes , according to the Agenda ; but it lasted much longer . #% I agree with the Commission proposal as to the scope of the Directive . #% It does not require a constitutional amendment , but it would be useful to have it incorporated into the protocol relating to national parliaments which we are currently debating in the Convention . #% 
Many lessons can be learned from the way in which tuna fishing is managed . #% My group regrets that , 15 months after the signature of Amsterdam , the Council has not integrated Schengen into the acquis . #% On the contrary , it is driven by - and is only for the benefit of - multinational GM companies . #% Researchers have even likened the long-term use of Internet pornography to the devastating effects of heroin . #% We need to discuss with each other - and this is not an attempt to interfere with the right of initiative of the Commission - is the law necessary ? #% Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this decision . #% It is important to redress the imbalances of the past . #% This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement . #% As of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos . #% It is very good to welcome a former colleague into a new elevated office but let me remind you Mr Moscovici , of the frustration which we experienced as parliamentarians trying to question the Council . #% Rather than repeating what has been said already , I would like to deal with three particular points . #% This , surely , is the bottom line in terms of the exclusion of citizens from society . #% On the pyrotechnics proposal we are conducting an impact assessment on amendments proposed by our rapporteur . #% I believe that this report clearly stipulates that this regulation can in no way constitute a legal basis to watering down existing safety protection in Member States . #% Firstly , labelling food such as soya beans , which are used in thousands of food preparations , is not practical . #% For me , criminal justice matters are intrinsically national issues and must remain so . #% Above and beyond the need for the developing world to have similar access to flu vaccinations , we must strive to set up a system whereby the poorest people of the world , who are almost invariably more exposed to disease , have the opportunity which we in the West take for granted to protect themselves from preventable diseases . #% Ireland represents 1 % of the European Union , 1 % of the economy . #% I am however concerned that the Commission might be repeating the mistakes already clearly identified in the BSE report . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office what stage has been reached in meeting the Lisbon commitments . #% Those who make their livelihood from fishing and the fruit of fishing in Northern Ireland must have their work sustained by proper safeguards and structural process and policies . #% By voting for the amendments , then going to conciliation on issues such as the patenting of human embryos and provision for a proper ethics committee , as Mr White has just pointed out , we would see the advances we want in medicine and agriculture but with the various safeguards built in . #% However , we will not have a serious effect on the level of injury until people realise that every person matters and that the loss or disablement of even one person is a great loss to us all . #% Thirdly , the proposed sector-specific directive for working time in road transport , when finalised , will supersede this common position and will provide a more detailed regulatory framework for this area . #% Something needs to be put in there to guarantee the rights of suspects , because at the end of the day they are suspects : they have not been convicted and therefore their rights should be protected . #% The Foreign Ministers in Vienna last week were correct when they said it was wrong to call this document a Constitution , because it is not a true Constitution in its right form . #% This is what I ask the European Parliament to take on as a duty : monitor the working of this treaty . #% If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms , then the cost of these medicines will be substantially reduced . #% The United Nations wrings its hands , the EU has stood back , but South Africa -- the model of peaceful ethnic resolution -- surely should take the lead . #% Some say we can not afford such new financing . #% I hope that by measuring the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide in these vehicles we will be able to develop possible measures to improve vehicle performance in these areas . #% It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties . #% The truth is something different . #% A lie that was perpetrated by people simply for political means . #% It would be my hope that the European Union could play a leading role in giving those people hope of a better future . #% Now , following the unexpected reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas , which commits to establishing a technical , non-party interim government and early elections , Europe must grab this opportunity to play a positive role in the region . #% I welcome Mr Blair 's statement this morning , whatever it means . #% Perhaps they were not at the same level of threat as the UK on that occasion . #% Our police , the Royal Ulster Constabulary , has had 302 of its members savagely murdered and 8 700 of its members brutally maimed . #% Of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here . #% They do not own up to the fact that it is mainly unanimous agreements in the Council of Ministers that lead to the making of the regulations that the Commission tries to supervise and enforce . #% Beef producers , sheep producers , pig producers , poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss . #% Finally , if this law or proposal was brought into any Member State or non-member country , Parliament would be the first to object and complain . #% I find it very difficult to get the attention of the Chair . #% It is long overdue for a so-called civilised country to abolish such a barbaric act . #% DGXXIV 's new duties in this field were given further impetus yesterday when the Commission announced to the House their response to the BSE report . #% Blanket secrecy is not the way to legitimise an evolving Community policy . #% We must define exactly and precisely what we mean by terrorism . #% I support the Commission 's proposal that the amount of the minimum sum insured in the case of the personal injuries arising from an accident should be unlimited . #% , in writing . - Some things are black and white . #% Extra-territorial legislation to convict those who travel abroad to abuse children is absolutely vital . #% Lastly , the African Union force must be strengthened and its mandate expanded to deal more effectively with the security situation . #% In collusion with the Socialist Group , the Commission inexplicably last December drew this week 's crisis upon itself . #% However , in recent decades there has been increasing criticism of the way the UN does business , the way it spends its money and the type of results it is getting or not getting . #% Bringing the measure into line with the long-established vehicle type approval system will also maintain the competitiveness and ensure the compliance of European car manufacturers . #% Recycling rates for polyester bottles of up to 70 % have been achieved in Germany and the Netherlands to date . #% Mr President , violence has brought neither greater freedom to the Palestinian people , nor greater security for the Israeli people . #% On any of these issues we must be very careful that we do not come out in a rush of Christian frenzy , thinking that we are going to solve all of the problems of all of the crime in the European Union simply by setting up another institution or another office with more staff , and coordinating and harmonising more power into a central authority . #% That goes for the Socialist Group and I will let the Liberals answer for themselves , for I understand they did not stand up at the Conference of Presidents and allow us to have a resolution before us . #% Moreover , it expresses the intention , in cases of a flagrant violation of European Union waste legislation , of inviting the responsible ministers of the relevant Member States to attend a committee meeting of the European Parliament to explain their policies . #% I can understand Mr Lechner 's frustration as he and some of the members of his group worked closely with industry to try and frustrate this resolution , but we can not have the politics of the press release overturning decisions of this House . #% Development aid , agriculture , transport and tax all have energy implications . #% I personally met with the Foreign Affairs Minister of San Marino within the last ten days and we had a very worthwhile exchange . #% The city lies at a crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south , a fact that has led many to believe that the incidents are solely based on religious hatred . #% The response to such a dire situation should be prompt and effective . #% All accidents are tragic for individual people and , of course , we extend sympathy to the workers involved in the incident at Tokaimura , their families and the 300,000 local people who were subjected to intense fear and worry for several days . #% 
I am especially pleased with the inclusion of animal welfare . #% I am delighted to support this report which will benefit us all . #% Mr President , I was interested to hear Mr Tannock remind us that these agreements between the European Community and Israel have been in operation since 1975 . #% Mr Barroso , your recent statements on the Lisbon strategy and the economic way forward for Europe have been very positive , and I wish you well . #% In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes . #% That has dramatically changed the political landscape in the region and the power shift has left the outside world in an unsure position as to with whom it should or could negotiate and develop a relationship . #% In college , I took the opportunity to study several courses of their history and literature under a rabbi . #% We have only to look at the Argentinean case . #% At the outset I want to congratulate and thank Madam Hermange for her advocacy on behalf of people with disabilities and in particular for her willingness to take on board new ideas with regard to creating a barrier-free Europe . #% I should like to make a few technical remarks about the report . #% Therefore I welcome the proposed review of this regulation after four years . #% The Burmese military junta can not use its ongoing conflict with the rebels of the Karen National Union as an excuse for attacks on civilians . #% Whilst we should take encouragement from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body 's rejection of recent attacks by the United States and Australia , we can not afford any sense of complacency . #% It is important to realise that the Bathing Water Directive should be considered in that wider context . #% It would appear that we have had some influence on him . #% Back in the 1950s , at the time of the Euratom Treaty , there was an optimism about nuclear power which was , frankly , unrealistic . #% I also wish to join in the thanks to the Commissioner for his work in the area of disability and in particular to welcome his commitment to involve the NGOs in the area , especially the European Disability Forum . #% In my constituency , an anaerobic digestion plant was recently forced to close because of rigid and unnecessary planning restrictions . #% My last point is that some people on both sides of this argument will try and present it as a clash of civilisations or religions or cultures . #% Mr President , although Member State governments have strongly criticised human rights abuses , regrettably they adopt a different approach in relation to larger countries like China and Pakistan , where there are huge trading and geopolitical interests at stake . #% Yes to green jobs , digital jobs , but do not forget local jobs and , as I said , the promotion of a not-for-profit ethos , not as a replacement , but as a counterbalance to the profit-driven model , which right now threatens the euro and the stability of the Union . #% Mr President , when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high-level group 's report , it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals . #% In relation to China I would hope that the Council would take a position which reflects the position of Parliament : the only democratically-elected institution within the European Union . #% It is time to call a halt to the ideologically driven forced march towards liberalisation and privatisation . #% Many people with disabilities face discrimination , maltreatment and institutional confinement . #% That is why we back a debate on alternative ways to fund the EU , cutting the amount coming from VAT and the national budget through options such as coordinated measures addressing the under-taxed financial sector . #% I might point out that in the presentation of the European Union priorities of the Irish presidency , which was made by the Tánaiste in the House this morning , one of the priorities which we set out under our drugs and organized crime proposals is an exchange and training of law enforcement officers . #% Is it not time that we named and shamed those Member States who are not taking the actions necessary to improve entrepreneurship and competitiveness ? #% Unfortunately , he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29 December 2003 . #% The fact is that the Commission has not enforced the Directive , and many Member States ignore its provisions . #% It could lead to certain claims being banned by default because legislators were not aware of them at the time of drafting . #% Insufficient welfare provisions , inadequate social services and high levels of youth unemployment contribute to late marriage and childbirth , thus accelerating the ageing of our populations . #% That is why I am heartened by the fact that Thabo Mbeke has met with Morgan Tsvangirai , the head of the opposition in Zimbabwe . #% It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch . #% This would be a retrograde step which risks undermining the positive results now being achieved by the present programme of structural fund aid in some parts of the Union , such as Ireland , for example . #% That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today . #% Poverty is a result of the actions of human beings and it can be resolved by the actions of intelligent human beings . #% If your ruling is that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations . #% I share concerns about citizens being ripped off and the worries about gambling addiction , but note that gambling is controlled in the majority of Member States in order to protect citizens against gambling addiction and fraud and to prevent money laundering . #% We have lost a brave and distinguished friend and I would like to express my thanks to the Irish presidency for the acknowledgment of the life and work of Archbishop Courtney made by An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during his response to yesterday 's debate . #% Maybe ` charter ' is a better word than ` treaty ' , and certainly more achievable . #% I am really sorry that he has not been handed that card . #% In your response you relied heavily on the economic argument , but we have to say that both nuclear energy and coal are , in fact , heavily subsidised . #% This integrated two-pronged approach , which marries environmental and economic concerns , is a positive departure . #% I am particularly pleased that Parliament 's resolution recognises and appreciates the quiet and effective ways in which Archbishop Courtney had been helping the peace process and alleviating the suffering of the people of Burundi . #% The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us , as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries . #% In the Pacific , also , nets are 40-50 km in length and that is an entirely different situation from what we have in the Atlantic . #% All MEPs want a fair statute because it is an albatross around our neck and when they play this opportunist politics , it will be seized upon by the press , in my own country and other countries , to lambast Parliament . #% It is the refrain from Irish Government circles that : No , there is no plan to harmonise taxes , and if there were , the Irish Government would reject it . #% There is no problem about an exit strategy . #% An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80 % of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States , while the Commission has final responsibility . #% But the present numbers of Spanish vessels in the Irish Box hoover up more fish than the whole Irish fishing effort can do itself . #% in writing . - The European Qualifications Framework ( EQF ) for lifelong learning is a good example of the European Union doing what it should be doing in terms of promoting mobility across national borders . #% We must win over national public opinion . #% The fifth framework programme looks promising . #% However , we have seen the rate of recycling of packaging waste increase steadily from 93 000 tonnes in 1998 to just over 414 000 tonnes in 2003 . #% Mr President , 22 % of all cigarettes purchased in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are smuggled into the country . #% Tourism has the capacity to provide employment and generate economic activity in its own region and for its own region . #% Training and Skills of researchers ; #% I am anxious about the potential damage to the Irish ecosystem with potentially dangerous effects on Irish agriculture and our tourism sector . #% The EU must take a firm stance against governments that are exercising blatantly corrupt methods of governance . #% Again , I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents . #% in writing . - I was eager for European citizens to benefit from this powerful instrument as soon as possible , and I am delighted to see the end of the legislative procedure one year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% Mr President , I welcome the efforts being made by President Santer to focus the work programme of the Commission on a small number of priority areas . #% The emergency aid voted through will go some way to help alleviate the problems faced . #% We are going to have to address this problem a lot more quickly , in particular we finally have to address the extremely sensitive issue of incineration which in most countries , I believe , causes local problems when it is mooted . #% 
I will undertake to raise with the Commission the comments made by the honourable Member . #% Of course , that is important but it is also very important to have the will of the majority . #% It is not simply a matter of training for particular job skills , although people with a low educational base face a higher risk of unemployment and such inequalities of education need to be particularly targeted in the case of both women and men . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this regulation has been in gestation for almost two years . #% Not all Greens and EFA members in our group - the non-federalists - would support Mr Dupuis ' amendments , because we believe that they are moving in the same direction and we would have grave reservations about that . #% Kosovo , despite recent progress , remains dangerously poised on the edge of a humanitarian disaster . #% I would ask him to give this House this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week . #% So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference . #% I would be very interested in that reply . #% This is vital and must be retained . #% Despite statements to the contrary , they can most certainly get two billion dollars ' worth of weapons into the conflict in Ethiopia and Eritrea . #% The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish . #% Somehow over the autumn and over Christmas and the New Year , by the time of the Council conclusions on 10 March , the seven had dropped to up to three additional substances . #% I am particularly concerned that my own Member State , Ireland , is seeking derogations yet again . #% The Cairo Conference and the Beijing Women 's Conference both stated the same thing . #% We are particularly concerned about depleted uranium because depleted uranium is a small-scale nuclear weapon . #% In order to achieve these goals I feel that the budget must be at least maintained , and I want to thank the rapporteur for a very good report and his cooperation . #% I support both those ideas . #% The balance of advantage , or the balance of returns to Member States , is extremely difficult to calculate . #% The internal market will still be protected from unjustified trade barriers under the environment legal base , Article 175 , which is predicated on protection of the single market . #% We can not forget that this deal also has a political content , because to the north of South Korea there is a very aggressive enemy , and I think we send out a message as well as to whom we support . #% Friends of both Israel and the Palestinians return more and more depressed from that area , as I did myself after my visit there a couple of months ago . #% But the Data Protection Commissioner is concerned that any moves by the Irish authorities to bring in scanners goes through proper consideration and balances security needs with individual privacy rights . #% It is a pity , however , that we failed to discuss whether we needed more export promotion and , if so , what for , and to go into this whole question in more detail . #% Perhaps there is now a necessity for closer cooperation and coordination concerning these matters . #% Nations , cities , towns and most of all people are the victims of terrorism . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply . #% . -- Mr President , I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur and indeed everybody involved in reaching an agreement which has produced a joint text on this important regulation concerning the Aarhus Convention . #% Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions . #% The ageing nature of our population , globalisation and technological advances present real challenges for European economic and social development . #% This directive , part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent , should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU , and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their contributions so far . #% Mr President , what is happening now was predicted well before the vote . #% I took the floor to say that it is a shame that we can not now deal with the two items on duty-free that are on the agenda and that some of us have come here to deal with . #% We should not criminalize these people but look at ways of dealing with the root causes of the problem . #% Women will be in one , men in another . #% Iraqi and Kurdish authorities should provide the monitors with full access and cooperation to protect the Iraqi population , including the Kurdish population of northern Iraq , now potentially at risk of attack from Turkey . #% The deadly cycle of attack and reprisal has to be broken . #% Like ALTENER , SAVE II is one of those programmes . #% Finally , I would like to say that not only fishermen are going to suffer but also their wives and families will suffer and death is going to come to the fishing villages and to the hopes of the future for these people . #% This EP resolution follows a series of worrying events such as the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information , the attempted prohibition by local authorities on holding equality and gay pride marches , and the use by leading politicians and parliamentarians of inflammatory or threatening language and hate speech . #% The one thing they all share is the necessity for solidarity between all peoples within the individual countries and across the European Union . #% He also falsely accused hundreds of MEPs , including 11 Irish MEPs , of ` milking no show loopholes ' in our daily expenses . #% European Member State governments are also required to connect all public administrations to broadband usage by 2005 . #% This is a very tough challenge indeed , not only for European Union governments but also for the European Commission , and indeed for ourselves in the European Parliament . #% In essence , the MEDIA programme will help to develop the audiovisual sector in Europe during the coming six years . #% This should be specified . #% The EU has had to take emergency measures for three cod stocks and northern hake and it is clear that other stocks will soon be added to the list . #% Mr President , I believe it is fair to say that the meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers in Naples last weekend was a very productive one . #% All I know is that there are no easy solutions and we can not wave a magic wand . #% So , there was a problem . #% You did so despite the fact that Member States received full weekly reports of our observations . #% That is very much the right approach . #% If we had a European Prosecutor , we could satisfy our taxpayers that we were taking matters to the proper conclusion . #% Since it is clear that the long-term goal set out by the Fifth Environmental Action Programme would not be attained easily , the Commission has rightly decided on a step-by-step approach setting out its so-called interim environmental targets for the year 2010 . #% I do not see either that it is appropriate in this report to talk about 50 to 60 years ' extension of nuclear power plants . #% I have therefore tabled amendments for the plenary which address both of these issues . #% Tuberculosis is a good example of the contrast between us and our neighbours in the developing world . #% I would underscore again that extreme caution is needed in biotechnology . #% I think not , Commissioner ! #% Furthermore , national authorities should examine ways of improving their services , and attention needs to be paid to improving early detection so that victims can be informed early that they have Alzheimer 's and decide if they wish to be cared for at home or placed in residential care before acute dementia sets in . #% What we find out from our investigation will be key for the future . #% As we ponder these choices , the latest European buzzword has been thrown into the debate by the Commission and Member States - that of flexibility . #% No-one can deny the benefits funds have brought to poor communities in industrial , urban and rural areas . #% It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction . #% I will now use a tremendous cliché truism - ` our greatest resource in the European Union is our people ' . #% 
But we must seek to renew engagement between the Palestinians and the Israelis at all costs , and the European Union must play a central and pivotal role in this process . #% And because your statement is being used by Pakistan 's embassies worldwide to undermine our report , you betrayed the EU mission you sent into the field and I say on their behalf , shame on you . #% This is a matter I will be raising directly with the Committee on Agriculture . #% I would like to know exactly how many people you counted in the chamber today ? #% Per annum we are now paying as much as # 600 - # 700 million pounds into this fund . #% It is wonderful that the scientific committees on public health and animal health are meeting on a regular basis to update one other and exchange information on the outbreaks that have occurred close to the European Union 's borders . #% Trafficking in human beings is now the world 's fastest growing criminal business . #% Mr President , I want to reiterate the concern that colleagues , particularly Irish colleagues , have mentioned about this MOX shipment back from Japan . #% In other words , if you ca n't put a spoon of the stuff in your cup of cocoa at night then you should n't be feeding it to the pigs either . #% Some Member States , including Ireland , were additionally afflicted by the foot and mouth crisis . #% In this context I welcome the decision by the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the nullification of the provisions of the Palestinian National Charter , which called for the destruction of Israel . #% Secondly , I may have misinterpreted what he said in his original answer , but am I right to understand that the criteria for the definition of SMEs and micro-enterprises will be updated and evaluated every year ? #% I will give the rest of my time to silence , as indeed did my colleague beside me . #% We make tyres with them , but we also create them when we burn waste . #% The report which is coming before STOA this week makes for worrying reading . #% I commend Mr Menrad and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their work on employee rights . #% I ask the Commission to take this on board immediately , before it is too late . #% Where should we go to from here , is now the essential question . #% And each one of those barriers is invariably justified by invoking the specious but emotive defence of preventing a ` race to the bottom ' . #% In conclusion , in relation to risk management , the measured and proportionate use of the proportionary principle or the political management ... #% There has been considerable criticism of lobbies . #% The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations . #% In aviation , I fully support the SKY initiative . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her answer . #% He must be forced to observe the Dayton Peace Agreement and international law in practice as well as in theory . #% The fund will act as a hand-up rather than a handout , as the money will be forwarded to third level colleges in the Munster region to pay the tuition fees of former Dell employees . #% Take Ireland in 2001 , where we had a foot-and-mouth outbreak and the country came to a standstill . #% That is what makes them choose other careers . #% All the calls this House has made for universal services of general interest to the citizens of Europe to be guaranteed as a matter of urgency have been ignored , although this is a key part of European citizenship and of the social model we are so proud of in Europe . #% At the same time it ill-behoves those anti-Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House . #% I wish to commend the work of my own group in the European Parliament who have inserted those principles of eradication of poverty into this revision . #% Sinn Féin supports those communities in Ireland fighting against the imposition of dangerous incinerators onto their communities . #% You currently have two factories , but by having only one factory , you could increase productivity while reducing costs by # 150 million and protecting the environment . #% Cosmetics containing any of 26 fragrances above a certain threshold are to be labelled with a warning which says ` could cause an allergic reaction ' . #% But one of the greatest problems - and here I want to come back to support what Mrs Harkin said - is the delay in approving new strands of GMO grains for imports into the European Union . #% Considering the amount of Moldovans who live and work in Ireland and contribute to Ireland 's society , this is a welcome step for the future of Europe . #% The Dutch presidency must follow on with specific measures on improving education , more relevant training , Community-based employment initiatives and giving priority to youth unemployment and life-long learning . #% As far as I can see , the registration problem still stands because it is now in the fleet but it was irregular to begin with . #% Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial . #% Can the Council confirm that notification has been given to states en route ? #% So its representatives are in a better position to stand up for themselves and make their own deal . #% We need scientists in order to have research and development . #% Phasing out the use of fluorinated gases in favour of competitive alternatives is an important step towards making real environmental progress . #% Likewise , the Serb minority in Kosovo has concerns that must be addressed . #% I have only one small query and that concerns the ongoing difficulties in both countries with abandoned and orphaned children and children and young people with disabilities . #% The figures agreed will permit Ireland only to increase emissions by 13 % relative to 1990 figures . #% The issue of taxation must remain the preserve and remit of the individual Member States ' governments . #% The United States is , of course , one of the countries which owes the largest amount of money to the United Nations . #% In terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no real consequence , the environmental impact remains . #% That is quite extraordinary , considering that we are one of the most stable and peaceful regions in the world . #% It would be a good idea by the way if we did something in our new buildings to do with renewable energy . #% Mr President , whereas there is much to be said about the deficiencies in budgetary discharge here in the EU and within the institutions , I wish to focus on national misuse of EU funding . #% In 2000 , for example , 531 million coupons were redeemed in the UK ; between 1999 and 2000 there was a 122.5 % increase in consumer use of Internet coupons and promotions . #% With a little more effort by the political establishment in Ireland , a ` yes ' vote could easily have been obtained but now that the referendum has taken place , many people , including supporters of the Nice Treaty , will be reluctant to overturn it . #% The final text which we will vote on tomorrow is to be welcomed as the fruit of successful negotiation . #% But accidents in nuclear installations , especially criticality accidents , are the most feared of all accidents . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether there is anything that the Commission can do to encourage the removal of the older animals from the national herd ? #% Mr President , Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz , Mrs Ewing and Mr Pimenta have said it all today . #% The issue before us today is a battle between creation and man 's discoveries . #% If a farmer , his son or his daughter has an opportunity or an idea to develop their farm or to diversify , they should be encouraged to do so and to expand and not be forced into the nearest town or village . #% In contrast , I should mention Japan and Taiwan , who have recognised the extent to which their longline industries use flags of convenience and they have taken corrective measures by launching programmes to repatriate or to scrap a large number of tuna longliners . #% There are millions of Muslims living within the Union who are fully integrated within our societies and who contribute positively to the development of the European Union . #% They are not confined merely to Belgium but exist throughout the European Union and much of the developing world . #% In current circumstances this court is needed more than ever . #% Facts please , Taoiseach , specifics please , no more wish lists , because this is the eighth time I have sat here listening to this at the start of a presidency and I find it very hard at the end of every presidency to see what difference has actually been made in relation to the Lisbon Strategy . #% I regret to say that this situation pertains principally to my own country , Ireland . #% 
I do not expect it to run smoothly , but I think that , if we apply the lessons we have learnt , and if we insist on the proper statistics being established in the first place before the money is released , then we will achieve a successful enlargement and will be able to help the rural areas without the loss of too much taxpayers ' money . #% This communication builds on the Giovannini report of November 2001 , which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union . #% We held out the hope and the desire and the wish that those countries could become part of the European Union . #% I am opposed to nuclear reprocessing and I believe that all reprocessing plants in the UK and elsewhere should be closed . #% author . - Mr President , I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members . #% However , the suggestion that a small group of Member States could forge ahead , creating a two-speed Europe , is vastly different in scope . #% We were all horrified recently when BNFL had to bring back nuclear materials from Japan , because it had falsified documents . #% The financial crisis , driven by unscrupulous financial speculators , who continue to make vast fortunes , whose activities have brought the world economy to its knees , need to be circumscribed . #% We need the Finance Ministers of the European Union to look towards the seventh framework programme and the necessary funding . #% Is that in order ? #% But having said that , we must also provide for the unpredictable . #% I am pleased that the presidency has been a success and that these issues have been put on the agenda . #% I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget . #% I fully support the committee 's enhancement of the directive . #% Everybody has been very supportive of Ambassador Moratinos today , but I believe that we in the European Union have been totally sidelined in the process . #% The recent humanitarian disasters in Haiti and Pakistan demonstrated once again that the EU 's disaster-response capability needs to be greatly enhanced . #% These disasters , while significant in themselves , may be only a portent of a greater global catastrophe to come . #% I would invite the Commission , in conjunction with the Member State concerned , to find speedy and appropriate solutions to this problem . #% It did not want to answer questions . #% Firstly , in the State of the Union address that President George Bush gave in January of this year , he committed , and the Congress approved some time afterwards , USD 7.8 billion to be put aside over the next ten years for research into hydrogen cell-fuelled automobiles . #% This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets . #% As a zone dedicated to stability we can exert a major positive influence on the global stage especially at this time of crisis . #% I believe that this is an ineffective proposal because it does not take account of the different legal traditions in the various Member States . #% The provisions of the Treaty of Nice can not come into effect until the ratification process has been concluded within the 15 Member States of the Union . #% By investing more of our resources into giving real education and real training to our people then we can guarantee that they will benefit from the huge explosion in job creation opportunities which will be presented . #% I believe that securing agreement for such a new arrangement would help to improve relations between the European Union and the Syrian people . #% He is so isolated he probably will never hear of the debate here today . #% It sends out a clear signal to anyone else who wants to do this : basically break the law , ignore it , and the Commission will help you at the end of the day . #% I would like to mention , as some of my colleagues have , the issue of the ` pipeline children ' , the inter-country adoptions . #% The rest of the text would have to be deleted because the Australians have removed it from their proposal , although that will not preclude others retabling it at the Conference of the Parties , if necessary . #% The foolishness of this proposal suggests that the people of Europe are more in need of protection from Brussels than from the sun ! #% It is a complex process , and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation , hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy . #% We must give the inspectors more time . #% I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency , which went out of its way to be helpful . #% By 2025 , 2 billion more people will be on this planet , 90 % of them born into the Third World . #% There will be difficulties ahead ; there are peace breakers on both sides who will try to derail this process . #% It is such a major trading partner that anything that would help us move and work closer together is very welcome . #% We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads , but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that . #% As far as ethical principles are concerned , I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary , unpaid donations of cells and tissues . #% The concept of crisis management systems needs careful handling . #% In fact , the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for US and British pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military-industrial complexes in both the US and Britain . #% I am calling on the Commission , under the auspices of the European directive , to carry out a broader study of the possible public health consequences of PVC products consigned to landfill dumps in Europe . #% This is completely unnecessary . #% While the very mention of the term `` GMO '' is enough to grab media attention , it is important that we put things in perspective . #% Can we keep them there ? #% Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , the strategic importance of Afghanistan can not be overestimated . #% If you look at Holland and Germany , on whose behalf there was so much crying in this Parliament , you will find that the single market has given them immense benefits and they have had extremely positive balances in their trade with the rest of the Union over the years . #% We are now into a new period -- an unprecedented revolution in technology , in the age structure of our population , and in the globalisation of capital , where there is a growing need to create a transnational democracy that is capable of effective governance of those new phenomena . #% First , Mr President , warmest congratulations on your election . #% Nevertheless , I could not be more full of praise for them . #% With this they monitored chat channels for 16 hours . #% Co-operation and co-ordination is the key . #% The people whom I represent in this House were sadly disappointed and very angry at the attitude the government headed by the President-in-Office has shown to the fishing industry . #% I believe it was Voltaire who said , ' I do not agree with what you say , but I will defend to the death your right to say it . ' #% The scandalous exploitation of young African footballers is a problem which I would ask you to look at again , because it does not seem to me to be addressed by the ban on inter-club transfers . #% Neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area . #% I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward . #% The biology of a baby is quite different from the biology of a teenager . #% We must continue to work with the United Nations , whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times . #% Another concern for me are the amendments which were passed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development calling for the reintroduction of the marketing standards of fruit and vegetables , which some MEPs are desperately trying to get back on the table . #% Every organisation needs to step back and review its methods . #% Four priority areas were identified where progress is essential namely #% A balance between the protection of employment law and collective agreements within the EU Member States and opening up a more efficient market for services has been achieved through compromise . #% But behind the reluctance of police forces to implement court orders on the custody of children in one country when they are abducted into another Member State , very often lies the potential for great tragedy . #% One of the tasks between now and December , if we choose to postpone this matter - as was the view of the majority of the Conference of Presidents - would be to invite the President of the Court of Auditors to undertake an extensive investigation as to whether it was to the Court or another institution that the leak could be traced . #% The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political . #% 
The first is the method and measures to be used for measuring the reconstruction needs of Haiti . #% I support this report which proposes a new comprehensive policy approach against gender-based violence including : establishing a criminal-law instrument in the form of a directive against gender-based violence ; training for officials likely to come into contact with cases of violence against women ; requirements for Member States to demonstrate due diligence and to record and investigate all forms of gender-based crimes of violence ; asks for financial support to NGOs working to support victims of violence . #% I happen to believe that if you are going to have real control of the finances of the European Union , it can only be best carried out at Member State level , because the Member States also have the ability to follow such controls through . #% According to the UNHCR my own country , Ireland , came third in Europe after Slovenia and Belgium in the number of asylum seekers it received last year , compared to the size of the total population . #% We know how you cut apart pieces of metal and how you transport them ; but we do not have a publicly-acceptable solution to what happens to the radioactive part of nuclear power stations . #% In fact , it was one of the carrots dangled during the single market debate in Europe -- sign on here , vote yes , you will have cheaper cars . #% That report will provide the general assessment of human rights across the globe and of many of the broader questions and challenges , as well as the more local challenges . #% I very much commend the work that Mrs Berès has done on this report , but we are talking about transparency . #% This is not the case from my experience . #% Is that alright with Europe ? #% There are 16 individual directives dealing with the purchase , marketing and presentation of fertiliser for sale . #% I hope that at the end of this discussion we will have a resolution that will be overwhelmingly supported by this Parliament and , in its own way , will create an impetus for support for the overall resolution in the UN General Assembly . #% Cuirimse céad mile fáilte roimh Taoiseach na h ` Eireann agus Aire Gnothai na h ` Eorpa ata anseo chun deire oifiguil a chuir le Uachtaranacht Eireann don Comhphobail . #% No cost-benefit analysis is provided for the further reduction of emissions from plants with already low emission concentrations . #% As the Irish know , Ireland is now open for business , but closed for people . #% It is also in line with many of the environmental groups around Europe who feel that this is crucial , as well as the rapporteur 's recommendations . #% Our presence here , as well as yours , Mr President , in the chair of this august assembly , sends a huge signal to all small Member States that the systems and the processes in Europe allow the smallest of nations to come to the top in the right circumstances . #% The Doha Round must succeed in order to strengthen the multilateral trade system to ensure the progress and harmonious development of the world economy . #% I would like a response on that . #% I welcome its recent conversion and I hope that it is successful in blocking this measure . #% In fact , I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening . #% Any actors seeking to influence decision making and policy implementation at a European level are expected to join the common register , which will make both registration and access to information about lobbyists easier . #% Mr President , everybody in this House is concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia , and the visit of the President of Colombia , Mr Uribe , gives this House the opportunity to make plain our concerns about that situation . #% Mr President , I should like to thank both the Commissioner , for an excellent Green Paper , and Mr Bowis for his report , which has added even more to what was an excellent standing start . #% What is required from the EU is to recognise what has happened and to support the work to date of the Arab League , for example , which initiated a dialogue in Khartoum on 22 June between the Transitional Federal Government institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts , which controls the south . #% I would also be interested if Sir Leon could tell us why it is considered necessary to register some of the Palestinian produce as being Israeli in order to facilitate its export to European markets . #% In fact in 1967 when the last outbreak occurred , the type of farming we have now did not exist . #% It is not just a catastrophe , it is also a man-made tragedy . #% But what our citizens want to know is what is the Council planning to do to ensure the public dissemination of the results of the Cardiff process to all citizens and governments of Member States and accession countries ? #% What strikes me is that there is no reference to EU participation . #% We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists . #% We do not need to develop them : we already have these weapons of destruction . #% The fishing industry is in crisis and the Commission paper has not helped . #% Too many sectors are excluded , which creates gaps and inefficiencies in the market , which risk pushing up the cost of doing business . #% You see what those weapons are doing to the East Timorese people . #% I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market . #% In fact , it was so far down on the list that , naturally , it was not taken . #% I hope that you are successful -- Europe needs you to be successful . #% The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently , under existing EU Treaties , unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union . #% We are playing into his hands by ensuring that people are denied access to medicines , food and the other necessities of life . #% I also firmly believe that the information contained on the blacklist needs to be easily accessible and widely available to all stakeholders ( national civil aviation authorities , all EU airports and of course passengers ) . #% It is something I advocate . #% Again , this was unfair to the taxpayers and constituted bad administration . #% Mr President , the pregnant mother and her unborn child , mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period , which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society , remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in Europe today . #% The main focus of this report relates to supporting greater cooperation between the fifteen Member States of the European Union to combat social exclusion . #% I would now call on you , Mr President , to ask the British Government to release this woman from jail as a matter of urgency . #% I also welcome the commitment of the Spanish Government to promote the implementation of EU regulations and directives , which should expand the use of new information technologies into all parts of the Union . #% Many are far more interested in their identity as , for instance , fans of a football club or a particular pop star . #% My thanks to Mr Patijn for his answer . #% There will probably be no winners , but there will certainly be losers . #% However , it will , of course , always remain the responsibility of each individual judicial authority to assess any evidence , forensic or not , in accordance with its own national law . #% It was disappointing that Ireland did not receive an appropriate share out of the additional milk quota despite the commitments that were given to Ireland in 1983 . #% That , I am afraid , is exactly what is happening in Gaza . #% With the change in government in Germany , as you would know , Madam President , Germany 's nuclear policy will obviously be re-evaluated . #% Every time the Northern Ireland fisherman goes to sea , he has to factor in the risk of savage penalty if he seriously infringes the CFP , but , according to the Commission 's figures , the Republic of Ireland fisherman in the same waters has no worries at all . #% It is essential that in the IGC discussions there are movements towards giving us a Treaty competence for renewable energy alongside that which we have , somewhat anachronistically , for nuclear power through the Euratom Treaty . #% It is important in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 that measures under the various EU programmes be screened so as to guarantee that they comply with all national and EU legislation in the field of equal opportunities . #% I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive . #% The failures have been obvious in that we gave them too many tasks and we did not give them the resources to discharge these tasks . #% The final deal before us this week is far more reflective of the reality of the Council and Parliament being equal legislators in this area . #% PKK terrorism and the massive military response in the south-east are inflicting real hardship on the region and its population . #% Lastly , what about CAP reforms ? #% I would like to ask the Commissioner a question concerning the 2002 rapid alerts . #% And , is it any wonder that there is such a glaring gulf between the European citizen and the European Union , when the policies we pursue disenfranchise people . #% You have talked also about factoring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate . #% We have contributed to the chaos in Palestine and we have allowed the Israelis to go too far in the name of their legitimate right to protect their security . #% 
This was the first step in rebuilding the relationship between the US and the European Union . #% Thirdly , the government of Sudan must be specifically singled out to take responsibility for the protection of its citizens and the disarmament of the Janjaweed militia . #% There are two things I would like to ask the Council . #% We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products . #% The Union runs the risk of a prolonged period of uncertainty and crisis , and stands on the threshold of sending deeply negative and dispiriting signals to applicant states . #% So why should we say that it should be reallocated regardless of the reasons for its not being utilised ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the banks are sorted out , and you can not sort out the banks if regulators ' stress tests refuse to admit that the sovereign debt crisis exists . #% Mr President , I recently attended a conference of Arab women in Beirut . #% Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important . #% Equality of access means that there should be no physical impediment towards people accessing training or employment opportunities . #% Existing minimum wage and child labour provisions should be enforced and improved . #% Even in the US , where only 8 % of websites have trustmarks , there are still considerable problems gaining legal redress . #% Furthermore , can I have the Commission 's confirmation that it will stick to the memorandum 's criteria as to safety and that we will always ensure its safety is equal to that of the EU ? #% Of course , I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Green Paper on the review of the common fisheries policy , which is all important , particularly to my own country . #% The Commission 's first cohesion report outlines and highlights the problem of continuing regional disparities in unemployment . #% This is a regrettable situation ; not only is it a missed opportunity for the EU to use its considerable influence better in order to raise human rights standards , it also undermines the credibility of the EU in a key policy area . #% On-going hostilities and human rights abuses must halt . #% In the common position antibiotic-resistant genes would just `` be phased out '' in the future , and only if `` they may have any adverse effects on human health and the environment '' . #% I know that there is a ban in place and I would ask the Commission to give us the decisive view on this , because we have received conflicting information from both sides of this debate . #% We await a common position from Council and Commission . #% I am arguing today that human cloning is about the wealth of certain scientists and their companies . #% A selective interpretation of Lisbon gave our countries ' financial planners an excuse to push profit , even where it was at the expense of people . #% I would like to take the debate in a different direction . #% I call on them to take the long-term view - to accede to the Commission 's proposals which also reflect the wishes of this house and indeed of the Vienna European Council . #% Thus exposure to the sun is a known risk , for example to the agriculture and building industries , and is already sufficiently catered for . #% Let me hasten to add that I am not one of those people who say that all governments are wrong and all opposition groups or all non-governmental groups are right . #% Two-thirds of Europe 's workforce are currently employed in enterprises employing less than 250 people . #% I commend him for the extensive work he has put into the preparation and completion of this report and I share his view that we need to stress the important role of EURES network , as a means of implementing European employment strategy . #% All the countries seeking to accede to the EU regard the prospect of membership of the Union as an essential ingredient in achieving the transformation of their economic and political structures . #% Last week , business confidence in countries such as Germany was on the increase . #% There must be proportionality . #% Parallel to the endorsement of the Amsterdam Treaty , the European Council has also launched two individual programmes to combat organised crime aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and establishing more efficient judicial co-operation . #% As well , we will always remember you as a person with a good sense of humour . #% We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage . #% Many people in America now recognise that unilateralism is not the way to go , that we require cooperation , not just in geopolitical terms but also in trade terms , and to ensure that the United Nations and other international bodies can operate effectively . #% Hopefully , all existing Member States will have seen the light and be participants in the single currency before enlargement so that the applicants will have no choice on this issue . #% Mr President , I join with previous speakers in welcoming the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate . #% in writing . - Firstly I wish to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work . #% My delegation or the Labour MEPs voted in favour to maintain the committee 's positions on these important provisions . #% It is not yet clear what impact that will have on this nutritional health claims proposal . #% There are other actuarial methods and accounting methods for dealing with pension contributions , health questions and so on . #% I found that I could not continue to read . #% Terrorism has to be fought decisively , but the means employed can not be allowed to create an environment of insecurity for citizens ' rights which is the very objective of terror attacks in the first place . #% One has to ask who rules society . #% The Irish presidency has made good preparation for its period in office . #% We know that air travel is safe but there is nonetheless a small risk for some passengers that they may develop blood clots . #% I also believe that as a short-term measure and for the purpose of dealing with the build-up of animals due to the market collapse , beef heifers should be included with steers as being eligible for compensation . #% The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging . #% Some EU Member States ' services have colluded in those renditions , either passively or actively . #% Fears of discrimination are not myths in Northern Ireland , they are stubborn facts . #% However , bearing those points in mind , I would commend this report to the House and my group will be supporting the position of the rapporteur . #% I should just like to say to Commissioner Kinnock that I will certainly write to him specifically about the Australian information . #% It was once known as the bread basket of Africa , and was once able to feed itself and many neighbouring countries . #% Mr Marset Campos does that . #% Immediate implementation of the Roadmap is vital if one is to generate momentum for a peace settlement in the region . #% We have already seen this on a number of different legislative fronts , both in the cooperation with Parliament and in the work with the Commission . #% Charles Taylor is being protected and given asylum status in Nigeria at present , despite the fact that Nigeria has ratified the Geneva Convention which states that those that have committed war crimes may not be granted refugee status . #% How then can the Council continue to ignore the democratic decision of the Austrian people ? #% They are a group of people who want to start a co-op to produce Fair Trade coffee . #% Mr Watson 's reference back to 1787 tempts me to go back a little further . #% Even though it is late it is important that this Parliament should extend this support if the Union is to see itself as a genuine buttress of fundamental human rights and the freedoms which we espouse worldwide . #% It is important so that Cambodia can move forward into the future that those responsible for heinous crimes against the Cambodian population be brought to justice . #% I think the euro will succeed . #% The House will recall the positive opinion on the substance of the measures and resolution of 25 October 1996 , the Gallagher report , and its opinion of 26 April 1998 on the implementation of technical measures in the common fisheries policy . #% He rang me before I came into the Chamber asking me if it would be possible to do that ; it is in your hands . #% We started out with 65 paragraphs and ended up with 95 . #% 
Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative , awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile . #% But it should be secondary to removing the disease and that was not the case and I criticise that particular scheme in that respect . #% The IGC is now moving forward at a strong pace . #% The main one is the exclusion from certain EU-sponsored schemes of many of the least well-off in our society . #% I congratulate the Commission on behalf of the Liberal Group for claiming ownership on behalf of all the Union of the stability pact concept and I believe that their proposal exhibits a careful and appropriate balance . #% If this process is to be a success , we must achieve progress along the political , economic and security tracks at all costs . #% Already 13 out of the 15 countries in the European Union have ratified the provisions of the Treaty of Nice . #% At this moment , I do not insist on a particular outcome , although I reserve the right to continue questioning the technical and political dimensions . #% I can recall a time when this Committee on Budgetary Control was just a subcommittee of the Committee on Budgets . #% Given the steps taken by Russia recently and the vulnerability of some Member States to Russian petulance , would the President-in-Office not agree that the essential element of maintaining security of supply lies in the complete liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union , and will he take steps to bring that about ? #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Hieronymi , on her report . #% Such a body is not democratically accountable by any definition , but these amendments would allow them to challenge the Commission without providing evidence of how or by whom they are funded or for what purpose . #% There is now perhaps an opportunity for us to re-engage with the elected representatives of the Palestinian people -- Hamas , with the Lebanese Government , with Israel and with the Governments of Syria and Iran to try to come forward with a deal . #% We need deeper knowledge in science and technology . #% As the British Government addresses the final details on this issue , it should be remembered that there is no safe level of radiation . #% We are setting up a federal European police force that will carry out its police activities in Member States . #% It seems to me that one thing we can add is the notion that we are not going to destroy terrorism by simply killing or imprisoning those who carry out these acts . #% While protesting peacefully against the erection of a high-tension electricity pylon right beside the orphanage , he was most viciously attacked by the police , arrested , denied medical attention and subsequently had great difficulty in obtaining medical treatment , as no doctor in the city was prepared to help him . #% I for one am opposed to a criminal justice system established on the continental model , with its inherent assault upon the essential building blocks of our distinctive and historic British common law system , which include not least trial by jury , habeas corpus , and the separation of the judiciary from the investigative process . #% At its recent meeting in November 1998 , the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations . #% However , the EU governments are seeking the conclusion of the more difficult chapters of talks between the applicant countries and the European Union before such a date can be announced . #% This is particularly true of the peripheral countries such as Ireland , Greece , Spain and Portugal , where communities that would have disappeared have been supported and maintained , if not for ever , certainly until a change in economic environment , until the new technologies arrived . #% I welcome this report 's dedication to a policy to vaccinate to live . #% Looking at the countries that will join EMU from the beginning , it appears that the countries on the outside may suffer punitive actions . #% I am very pleased to see the Commissioner here . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for the thorough airing she gave to this subject and for the usefulness of her report . #% The multiannual programme is to cover the period 2004 - 2008 , and is valued , as we know , at EUR 129.62 million . #% Ongoing reforms are needed ; constant vigilance is necessary against the ability of mankind to interfere with , interrupt or corrode public life . #% We show no sign of implementing this in practice and it is clearly not possible to achieve success without clear objectives , targets , incentives and sanctions . #% Of course it was wrong of Blair and Bush to rely on and peddle false information to justify the invasion of Iraq , but the removal of Saddam was right and necessary . #% No , there is only disgrace in resisting reform where it is needed . #% Most importantly , however , they will ensure that the minorities within Kosovo are also protected and represented and that they do not become part of a singular state in which they have no influence or role to play . #% These require a full and proper debate in Parliament . #% the relationship between church and state #% I can well understand why consumer confidence should be shaken at this moment . #% Looking ahead to 1997 , I believe that the Commission will have to give more attention to educating young people on the potential advantages of the single currency . #% We must allow regions to choose whether they wish to be GM and we must protect those which do not . #% The said in an article that the leaders attempted to answer the question of what impact globalisation would have on the European economy and concluded that we needed more research and development and , of course , more money . #% The problem in Vietnam is also that domestic human rights monitoring is not allowed , and that independent human rights monitors continue to be prevented from visiting the country . #% I believe that if this directive is to be effective it must be implemented sooner rather than later . #% Thank you very much for your contribution here this evening . #% There is no need for the IRA to continue to exist . #% I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner , Mr Patten , who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office , perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming . #% Obviously , whilst nine years is not the perfect solution which Parliament originally sought , it is the best possible compromise . #% You will know that in the case of the UK , at a moderation seminar , the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites . #% We have all got to work together to overcome this problem and prevent the civil unrest and misery that could arise from it . #% I welcome the articulation of ten guiding principles which focus on the needs and requirements of SMEs and aim to help them realise their full market potential . #% It is not live beef , as some people have said , it is live animals which feel pain just as we do . #% Many of us do not understand why this could not have been done in seven minutes , because it is clear that we have principles . #% But , as I have just indicated to the House , the rules currently governing the structural funds will expire at the end of 1999 . #% Having consistently criticised the United States for its one-sided approach which meant that it was exacerbating the situation by becoming part of the problem instead of part of the solution , I regret that the PPE-DE Group is putting itself in a similar position . #% It is not enough to say that sometimes , as the President-in-Office said , the Council can not prevent occasional shortcomings . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement . #% In my own constituency of Munster , I have just learned that the port of Limerick is to lose substantial facilities through sale of important land . #% According to the World Health Organisation , they are responsible for large numbers of cases of illness and even death worldwide each year , and their use has steadily risen . #% The report on substitution calls for the introduction of substitution policies for certain product categories . #% I am hopeful that policies developed under the newer system , where you have all-stakeholder consultation , will be better than the top-down policies . #% Mr President , I fully support legislation to upgrade the quality and standard of telecommunication infrastructures within the European Union . #% Secondly , there is a vast wealth of experience and knowledge of different systems , of different methods of employment and employment policy within this Parliament . #% I do not know what kind of a message that will send to people in Ireland . #% These measures will be of significant help to SMEs . #% We need to be in a position to implement the full policy agenda as set out by the Lisbon process . #% For that reason the European Union , rather than having an army , should set up a Commission department of peace and reconciliation with a Commissioner of peace and reconciliation to spread this philosophy . #% European leaders must accept that it is perfectly reasonable for people to be concerned about the possible impact which the abolition of the currency in their pockets and its replacement by an unknown and so far non-existent euro will have on their personal circumstances . #% Sunday as a weekly day of rest is a tradition to which the vast majority of the people of Europe are attached , and it adds to the social and cultural aspects of our life for most of the people of the European Union . #% It amounts to a form of intergovernmental conspiracy against citizens ' right to know . #% 
Is the Council content with this situation and , if not , what action is proposed ? #% I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal . #% Mr President , I am delighted to see that at the European Council meeting in Brussels last week , the 25 Heads of State and Government joined together in congratulating His Holiness , Pope John-Paul II on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his Pontificate . #% I am disappointed that we have not been able to make further progress . #% It is important that we inject a new political dynamic into the enlargement process . #% It is perhaps understandable that the preparations for the single currency have received considerably more public attention than the IGC in view of the direct and obvious impact which the Euro will have on our daily lives . #% We need to look at our position as regards developing countries . #% Madam President , in relation to the enlargement reports - not just Mr Brok ' s report , but also those on the individual applicant states - it is interesting to see that Mr Brok has recognised the rejection of the Nice Treaty in Ireland . #% No link has been made in the inspectors ' report to international terrorism . #% Once appointed , H.G. Wessberg will serve until the end of Sweden 's mandate , that is until March 2012 , and could then be re-elected for another mandate of six years . #% Down the road this Parliament will find itself having to address the serious problem of the human resources of agriculture necessary for the continuity of the agricultural sector . #% What is so very different about EU textiles as to lead to what appears to be a very prudent approach by the Commission , rather than the swift and fair approach of the US ? #% I know that there are concerns in Greece in relation to the Olympics due to take place in 2004 , and that various discussions are taking place on this matter . #% The kind of model that has been successful for Europe has been one that we have created ourselves . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur who used her experience in the fifth framework programme and her professional experience as a scientist to the great benefit of all of us , particularly following her accident . #% Mr President , I too join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Vice-President . #% Let us not forget that this is against a backdrop where the Galileo satellite project started off with a budget of EUR 7.7 billion and is now projected to cost EUR 22.6 billion . #% It is not acceptable to this House and it should not be acceptable to the European Union . #% However , Mr Barroso rightly has not rolled over and died in front of the onslaught that has taken place , over the last week in particular . #% It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security . #% However , from the outset let me say that aquaculture must be fully integrated into the common fisheries policy . #% Food consumption patterns are what is important . #% We welcome initiatives by the Member States in the EU on safer Internet use for children but we need to step up our actions for a more coordinated campaign to fight against Internet paedophilia . #% I certainly welcome the active role the High Representative of the EU for the common foreign and security policy is playing in the Middle East . #% But then that is not an immediate priority under the plan . #% The most important objective is to ensure that there is momentum on this issue . #% To earn the same as a man would earn on average for a calendar year , a woman on average must work until the end of the following February , a total of 418 days . #% This Sellafield nuclear plant has achieved nothing , except to heap environmental misery on us all . #% At present , the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors , including rising production costs , competition from imports from third countries , and , of course , various issues which contribute to the rising cost of feed . #% Is he going to dismiss them and refuse to accept their advice or opinions any more ? #% My own feeling is that every possible sanction should be imposed on the Algerian Government to ensure that human rights are respected for everyone : men , women and children . #% I will be supportive of any such proposals which come before this Parliament . #% Not enough consideration has been given to criteria for granting aid . #% She has not made the usual mistake of condemning the whole system . #% Mrs Roth , speaking earlier for the Greens , spoke of her belief in the need for morality in politics . #% As a consequence of this I was being asked to vote on amendments which I had not had the opportunity to consult about or research and on which I would be precluded from debating on the floor of the House . #% This deal would result in major job losses at farm and industry level across rural areas in Ireland and the EU as a whole . #% It must be made absolutely clear that any of our delegation offices are there not simply to have a cosy relationship with the local administration but to represent EU policy in the wider sense . #% I want to make the point that in our anxiety to protect consumers we must be equally careful not to over-regulate a sector which has the capacity to produce a diverse range of quality food . #% The Commission has been found guilty of malpractice . #% When I spoke about other minority languages I meant those within the Union . #% Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators , especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs . #% We must therefore do more than simply put security measures in place . #% Women are being used as the raw material for such research because there is an invasive procedure to extract eggs , the raw material for cloning . #% In this case , in particular , the fact that although fresh evidence has come to light and a re-trial has been denied is despicable . #% The Committee on Development was unanimous in supporting the following key principles . #% So I would urge the Commission that we should have a much tighter timeframe . #% In the past the European Union has been criticized on the grounds that it is going to be a great melting pot in which small communities and minorities will all be lost . #% Commissioner Lamy , you know from the last time we discussed this in this Chamber that the PSE Group feels it is quite inappropriate to pursue , of the Singapore issues , investment in particular . #% Today , that report is being discredited by some , perhaps too sweepingly . #% Proposals and actions in this field should not simply be confined to the territory of the European Union . #% We need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up . #% If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence , then someone has to take the first leap . #% The directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles was the second arm of the package of the two proposals to emerge from the Council 's first reading on the recommendation of my predecessor as rapporteur , Mr Goodwill . #% Madam President , I wish to raise a matter which is not , but should be , on this week 's agenda - the foot-and-mouth disease crisis in Europe . #% As someone who also comes from Northern Ireland , during the earlier part of my 16 years in this House , I had to rise nearly every month to express condolences to the people of my area . #% We are all citizens of democratic countries and , as far as I am aware , the vast majority of the citizens of each of our countries accepts the democratic nature of our national governments . #% The key issues for my Group at the first reading were basically the direct marketing of food on the farm or at local retailers and flexibility for the processing of traditional products . #% Nobody can be allowed to pollute our groundwater or freshwater with nitrates or anything else . #% Outreach services need to be put in place so that these women and children can access the necessary services and be protected from violence . #% Over the years most of us will have made representations on behalf of nationals of our own Member States who find that when they take advantage of the freedom of movement available to them within the EU and actually move to another country they are discriminated against because their qualifications are not properly recognised in their new country of residence . #% We are a continent that is sending USD 2 billion worth of weapons to drought-stricken Ethiopia and we can not find a couple of helicopters to send urgently to save people drowning in Mozambique . #% I do this also at a time when a renegotiation process of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement gets under way this week in Britain , sponsored by the Irish and British Governments , which involves all of the parties there in an attempt to get this process back on its feet . #% We need to ensure as far as we can that freight is removed from our roads and is placed onto alternative means of transport . #% It is high time to put real money into supporting renewable energy sources . #% Mr President , I am grateful for the support I had in producing this report . #% 
The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle . #% As I pointed out when I spoke earlier in this debate , he has also promptly responded to those who have petitioned Parliament . #% The bringing together of the data in their intelligence banks and policy strategy is of imperative value to them in their fight against terrorism . #% Maritime safety is a priority and we must do all we can to ensure that human error is kept to a minimum . #% The protection of our coastal zones is essential and I feel that stronger legislation is needed to ensure this protection . #% One further aspect where the British presidency conclusions agreed that further work was needed was better consideration of the changing role and functions of urban areas . #% For all the above reasons the Fianna Fail MEPs approved the recommendations from the Budgets Committee ( Haug report ) . #% As Mrs Dybkjær has just said , what they have done is to tell the other EU governments to carry on as usual ; they will then go back to the Irish people and get them to vote again until they get it right . #% Ireland and Europe have to adopt immigration policies based on full respect for human rights as set out in international conventions , such as the Geneva Convention . #% What proposals for financial help were requested ? #% The fact that Europe outstripped the United States in growth terms for half a century up to the mid-1990s , by developing and putting into place a remarkable social infrastructure which ensured that prosperity could be shared , was a remarkable achievement . #% I have just come from a committee meeting where we voted on the principle of partnership and involving local partners . #% We can give them what they ask for : financial assistance in their struggle . #% Madam President , may I congratulate the Finnish presidency on this initiative in which I fully support him . #% Of the 200 parliamentarians participating in that Convention , only eight signed an alternative text , basically arguing for the disintegration of Europe . #% The issue is not as black and white as it is being presented . #% Nevertheless , this will remain an essential mechanism for assisting heavily export-dependent sectors to maintain a position in export markets in periods when prices are plunging and markets are uncertain . #% While this serves to make fishermen ' s lives easier and safer , it does come with certain social costs in terms of employment . #% This is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including Sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate . #% But according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits . #% I hope the scientists are right and that this improves . #% Under no circumstances can the cohesion process for existing less-developed regions be jeopardized , nor should there be any link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund . #% We came to know and admire him as a man dedicated to his calling , his work and to peace . #% I agree with her : there is nothing more important that we could devote time to discussing in this Parliament . #% The benefits of the change from an adversarial to a consensual approach are very clear to everybody . #% I hope the Minister would agree with that . #% In the light of recent reports , there is great fear for the safety of these people and the people with whom they work . #% We must compare like with like . #% We also need to look at concepts as yet unmentioned , such as hope and fear , creativity and expression , faith and spirituality . #% In addition , if we are to shut down or refuse investment from every company which may have an association with the arms industry , then we would have to close virtually every American and Japanese software company on the island of Ireland with catastrophic consequences . #% In an enlarged Europe of 25 -- soon to be 27 -- Member States , the Council may well resort to more frequent use of a dual legal base in order to try and satisfy various national interests . #% The Commissioner said that he hoped it would be good enough , but I have to say to the Commissioner that ` hope ' is not enough . #% Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely , as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling . #% As they did that , they eroded the divisions of centuries and as a result the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving . #% Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteurs for these reports on measures intended to promote observance of human rights . #% If they have unemployment - and it is , I have to say , then new to them - they look after their unemployed better than do other countries . #% Madam President , I fully support the rapporteur 's excellent proposal to split the financial framework programmes into two specific programmes . #% It is equally important that the reform of the CAP should be considered in parallel with the reform of the Structural Funds because an essential component of structural policy throughout the Union should be the preservation of present population levels in rural areas and in the relatively isolated areas on the periphery of the Union . #% This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently . #% No one campaigned against enlargement on the `` no '' side . #% It is vital to achieve the Lisbon targets , but as the shadow PSE rapporteur , I wish to complain about the procedure . #% Most synthetic drugs can be produced locally . #% We accept democracy nevertheless , because it is the only way . #% We must tackle our dependence on oil , diversify our energy sources , promote energy conservation measures , develop renewable energy sources . #% The government of Mauritania has full discretion regarding the use to which the financial compensation element is put . #% I appeal in particular to the Group of the Party of European Socialists to try to give us a way out on this , because we want to support the overall thrust of the García Arias recommendations . #% The Community average income of sheep and goat producers is generally amongst the lowest of all sectors , especially in northern Europe where lambs are reared in meat production systems . #% Like other speakers , I would like to support the call for the arms embargo to remain . #% She should have a better sense of humour on such matters . #% The dissolution of the Hong Kong Legislative Council is an ominous sign , as is the stated intention to restrict freedom of assembly and expression and to alter the composition of the island 's civil service . #% The promotion of entrepreneurship will allow citizens themselves to play a real part in our economic recovery . #% The Commission ' s determined effort to restore consumer confidence by putting effective control mechanisms in place is clearly welcome . #% This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into National Action Plans and to implement policies to promote equal opportunities . #% For many years the FAO has been warning of the problems , yet we keep looking for fish somewhere else until there is nowhere else . #% When it comes to taking legal action it is up to individual citizens themselves to take up these cases and that can be extremely difficult and expensive . #% The report , which is considered to be one of the best ever on air quality , raises very many serious concerns which I have proposed , as Quaestor , to bring to the attention of the services in the building . #% Regardless of the rights or wrongs of these two hardline positions , we do not need a report calling on the European Union to pursue a preventive policy against any form of violent religious fundamentalism . #% However , I have many reservations . #% It is very important that all the EU institutions operate effectively and efficiently and the 370 million citizens of the European Union must support and have confidence in the Union 's internal legislative processes . #% A lot of work needs to be done there . #% They are n't . #% My own country , the United Kingdom - the windiest country in Europe - has some lessons to learn from work in other countries . #% The Socialist Group played a key role in securing $ 108 million for Ireland 's Peace 11 programme for 2006 , and continues to pledge its full support for the programme . #% We must bear in mind that the European Union imports 52 % of its total fish consumption from third countries . #% However , this has to be a relationship based on equality and mutual respect . #% Through this same hard work and willingness to interact peacefully with the rest of the world , it is becoming a significant economic player globally . #% 
One of these problems is how we dispose of our waste . #% In many cases these are the local and regional authorities . #% I , and those people I represent , support a united democratic Europe and enlargement . #% On south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements . #% On Mrs Beres ' report on universal service for telecommunications : the Liberal Group abstained on this because the definition of universal service was too loose and too broad and references to uncosted funding requirements for such services were too vague . #% Both identities fully respect principle number one , respect for difference . #% I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative . #% However , I am disappointed that reductions are being made in the overall budgetary allocation but I hope that the European Council , when it comes to reviewing the second reading of the EU budget for the year 2000 , will take on board the recommendation of this Parliament that it should increase the funding for the programme to EUR 67 million or IEP 53 million in next year ' s allocation . #% There is no disgrace in reform . #% Could I ask that this House move from making declarations to establishing an ad hoc committee so that we can prepare a common position for the European Union and the World Bank and then drive the Council and the Commission to adopt Parliament 's position on this issue ? #% I must emphasize that we certainly support the tenor of this report and consider it to be extremely important in the opinion-forming necessary before the fifth framework programme . #% What is going to be left for Irish fishermen ? #% I think that there is a political will throughout the European Union to devote whatever resources are necessary at least to alleviate the present hunger and suffering . #% What I said in the newspaper was that , unless these investigations were carried out , the public were going to assume that there was corruption going on , and we have a duty in this House to get things investigated . #% There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive . #% If there is any thing we should do while we still have power and influence in the world , while we still have riches beyond the dreams of the vast majority of people who live on this earth ; if there is any objective we could set ourselves which would be a historic achievement for a united Europe , it is to help along the less fortunate peoples of the world . #% We welcome the fact that you have now brought forward the new Toy Safety Directive . #% This can not be allowed to happen . #% There is not . #% To succeed as the most progressive combination of States , we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended . #% I have one major concern and that concerns my own country . #% Helmut Kohl said he believed that at the end of the line to European Union lay a European army and European police force . #% I wish to ask Commissioner Dimas specifically why he continues to allow the Irish Government to add a pollutant , fluoride , to our public drinking water supply . #% In software , the great ideas of yesterday are the building blocks of the great ideas of tomorrow . #% This is a very serious business for the European Parliament . #% I can bring hundreds of examples of discrimination , of ignorance , thousands of examples of prejudice . #% In Sinn Fein 's view the Irish Government need to take a lead in strengthening the rights and protections of consumers . #% It is unacceptable to reject measures to conserve depleted species because they would hurt completely unregulated fisheries for other depleted species . #% I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% The earth 's temperature is rising at an alarming rate . #% Terrorist attacks are an attack on the most fundamental human right - the right to life . #% Mr President , I have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which I served with Sir Jack StewartClark . #% Most of our group will support it , as indeed most of Parliament will support it . #% Mr President , many of you this week will have noticed the exhibition about the work of Herman Hesse in the Spinelli building . #% It is not necessary to complicate EC legislation further by founding it on multiple legal bases . #% This directive is attempting to achieve a massive amount in one brave step . #% In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is always going to take time . #% Will there be zero excise in international waters ? #% The EU has a responsibility to raise the profile , by all available means , of the continuing scandal of what amounts to modern-day slavery . #% The Commission can also provide badly needed technical aid and expertise to help Russia restructure its economy . #% In the long run this is the right approach to take for the sake of public health , consumer protection and the environment . #% This is simply a matter of best practice in industrial policy and the correct management of public finances . #% It seems that it has basically decided to participate in the overfishing . #% The legal framework is clear : Article 52 of the European Patent Convention states that software as such can not be patented . #% However , I also see the need for promoting the development of alternative technologies which are more environmentally benign than the existing ones . #% Furthermore , any meagre fine they will be obliged to pay pales into insignificance when compared to the huge profits that they make . #% It crosses all parties ; it crosses all Member States . #% He rightly spoke about the importance of the Doha Round and the impact that will have , not just within Europe but around the globe , on increasing trade and also on delivering on aspects of social justice , though not a comprehensive package of social justice . #% If farmers have to farm 100 % of the area they farmed during the reference years 2000 to 2002 in order to draw down the decoupled or area-based payment , it will put huge pressure on the price of rented land or Conacre as we say in Ireland both in Ireland and in other countries . #% I would ask Members to support the resolution and our call for a full , independent , international judicial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case . #% We must all continue to cooperate more closely in the future to ensure that the twin evils of international terrorism and international criminal activities are defeated . #% As an Irish Member , I am all too aware that the overwhelming majority of environmental legislation , as well as attitude changes , are a direct result of our membership of the European Union . #% We can not go on haemorrhaging indigenous jobs in the pursuit of what really is an unacceptable dogma . #% This is one of the biggest areas of concern to the ordinary man or woman in the street who is the embodiment of the European Union . #% Can the Commissioner comment on what the Commission is thinking in relation to those services -- other than the post -- that are offered , and when a decision might be made by the Commission so that there will be more clarity ? #% I wish to ask the Commission : is it prepared to use Article 100a to set a consistent set of emissionsrelated targets , which are non-optional , to set within that a menu of tax options available to states to be chosen through subsidiarity , consistent with the integrity of the internal market and , in that way , to actually find a policy mechanism to promote what we all say we want based on a recognition that the current procedure of always falling back on Article 99 leaves us adrift ? #% The debate we are holding here today relates to the enlargement of the European Union . #% The net effect of this will be that Member States like Ireland can refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose permit was restricted , suspended or withdrawn in another Member State . #% The CAP produces measurable results and a clear return on investment with regard to the delivery of public goods . #% Mr President , I would like to thank most sincerely our rapporteur Mr Perry for his report on the Lloyd 's Petitions which date back to 1997 . #% The Commissioner quite rightly pointed out that it is an issue that has to be pursued through the UK courts . #% However , I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne , Faro and Helsinki Summits . #% I know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns . #% In my view , it should be brought forward in Seville . #% In addition , there has been quite an amount of legislation to cater for the introduction of the euro , covering areas such as finance and social welfare . #% In previous debates in Parliament I have put on record my own views in relation to biotechnology . #% 
It is true that agreement was reached on an increase in the financing of the trans-European networks but it is very disappointing for many of us that the money must be found from existing resources . #% Many of us believed that they were doomed from the start , specifically because the EU gave too much too soon , while the US gave very little at the beginning and remained dogged in its position . #% I find it very hard in this modern day and age to understand why we have not made greater progress . #% I speak for many of my constituents when I tell you that people purchasing houses are worried about whether the interest rate is going down , about house prices going up , when and where , and what the long-term outlook is . #% I am becoming attracted to trading as a way of meeting our needs . #% No data are available on the state of landfill waste containing large amounts of PVC . #% To take up the point made by Mr Nicholson : why should young people in the Celtic Tiger economy in Ireland remain on the land ? #% Sport can play a vital role in encouraging development and sports projects can contribute to reaching the Millennium Development Goals , especially under themes such as health , education , gender , environment , peace and human rights . #% It is a lesson to the Middle East that it is unwise to nationalise the oil industry . #% However , Rule 127 states that the President must make a decision on whether or not he will accept the point of order , and that he may wait for up to 24 hours before he makes that decision . #% Satellite and cable television have ensured that . #% We have already seen this when dealing with the Services Directive over the last six years , where even now we are only at second reading . #% The most important issue , as you , Taoiseach , and every other speaker emphasised , is the draft Constitution . #% The fact that the governments have so far failed to reach agreement on this is unacceptable to everyone . #% I do not think it would be fair or reasonable to hold out the hope that all languages in the Union will become working languages . #% This means maintaining at the very least the measure currently outlined in the chairman 's draft text . #% Mr President , poor Mr Vitorino has one of the most difficult jobs in the Commission and he does it extremely well . #% It reaffirms the European Community 's commitment to reducing climate change and will provide a considerable stimulus to the development of new environmental technologies , thus contributing to our Lisbon Agenda knowledge economy goals . #% As you know , this commission also deals with the question of reparations in the aftermath of the Gulf War . #% We appreciate that no major breakthrough on any of the important issues at the IGC is likely until after the British general election . #% There is no point in the Americans saying `` we support the Israelis in what they are doing '' or `` we are calling on them to be more moderate in their response . '' #% We need to be able to hold on to our best researchers and innovators . #% Indeed , if you look at the Treaties that give the legal basis and authority to the Member States and to the different institutions to take action , the Council can in fact take action under the Euratom Treaty . #% Also , would he not agree that it is extraordinary that the Court can claim that insufficient evidence was provided by the Commission to enable it to make a decision in relation to the imposition of fines ? #% We are working closely together in the Balkans and Afghanistan . #% Compared with the agreements with the ACP countries , this is a much more equitable agreement in that it is not an exploitation of the country involved ; Latvians will be employed . #% Some EU-based multinationals previously wreaked havoc in countries such as Bolivia with water privatisation and their baleful influence is already being felt in Canada . #% Sadly , the totalitarian despot , Mr Milosevic , is fuelling the flames of genocide and compounding the misery of the Kosovar Albanians . #% This is an excellent initiative and I fully endorse the goal of highlighting the educational value of sport . #% The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the Camp David peace treaty in 1979 . #% I would like a precise answer here today . #% Instead we should direct our energy and resources to bringing stability to the sector , restoring consumer confidence in food and investing in promotion and market development . #% This is a whole area which will become much more centre-stage in the context of enlargement because there will be , in the context of the Union , that much more pressure from Member States to accommodate minority languages . #% He will do everything in his power to ensure that something of interest to all Europeans gets through an appropriate Council . #% In this context , I should like to see more renewable energy used in public buildings in Brussels and other places in the European Union . #% We need the extension of the time limit for proposals from Member States in relation to their disease programmes . #% I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world : much to our shame , we have taught them some tricks . #% Let us think about the developing world and the energy needs there . #% Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998 . #% Following the costs incurred by taxpayers during the crisis , it is essential that we ensure the financial sector contributes fully and fairly to an improvement in public finances . #% Given that it is the objective of the Commission , and indeed of the European Union , that increases in traffic should be absorbed by the rail system , does the Commissioner not think that there is a conflict here between what we are seeking to achieve , in relation to the moving of goods in particular , and that he should at least talk to the Irish Government about establishing some coordination between the White Paper , the proposed national transport policy which the government claims it is working on , and the proposal to close the rail network in Ireland ? #% However , Member States should not be allowed to become complacent in the implementation of these 42 directives . #% He is not allowed to leave the country , people watch him wherever he goes , he is not allowed to make contact with foreigners and he is not allowed to contact journalists . #% The veil of secrecy on abuse is now lifting and no country can take pride in what all too often children have been subjected to . #% We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur , lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons . #% Property rights are a very major concern for citizens and one that I fear will become increasingly so , if I judge by the complaints coming into my own constituency office from citizens who have purchased properties across Member States of the European Union . #% There has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment . #% We , in Parliament , want to be involved in translating the Eurospeak into real action and we look forward to the final draft of the European spatial perspective which we hope will be agreed at a future Council meeting . #% Patents that are registered or bought will control the very tools the programmer must use to exist as a programmer . #% I call on Commissioner McCreevy as a matter of urgency to reintroduce Manning of Ferries Directive , unblock the Temporary/Agency Workers Directive and fundamentally amend the Bolkenstein Directive . #% Lets recognise that a debt moratorium for indebted countries will not do half enough to allow them rebuild their battered communities . #% This failure by the Council to assume political responsibility should caution a certain modesty among those in some of our capital cities who seem prone to see the failings revealed in recent days as almost uniquely the creation of the European Commission . #% Agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference is therefore not solely a matter for Member State governments . #% The Commission proposal is based on the principle of sustainable development and the poor state of fishery resources . #% I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to . #% I welcome the fact that the threshold is to be increased . #% We would look ridiculous now if we reverted to a weaker position . #% Mr President , let me say at the outset that , as a member of the European Parliament 's High Level Contact Group for relations with Northern Cyprus , I am clearly aware of the sense of isolation the Turkish Cypriots feel in light of the rejection of the Annan Plan . #% Also , although support for renewable energy is highlighted in points 3.1 and 3.3 of the guidelines , it is futile to provide support for renewable energy at a local level if national policy is prohibitive to the development of the sector . #% If the Commission is setting a precedent and , more to the point , if the Council sets a precedent this week , should we not be told , at the earliest date and when the House is as full as possible , of the precedent and the response of the House . #% I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union . #% Would you agree that many of the host countries need a policy of integrating workers from new Member States , to be fair to their needs , and that we need to allow migrant workers with qualifications to progress in the careers for which they are qualified in the host Member States ? #% It probably has a better chance of success in addressing wider policy issues , like transport environment or economic policy questions , than for example the CO2 tax , which has not really managed to take off and generate the appropriate consensus . #% Amendment No 6 to the Mombaur report should not be admissible . #% You were able to find a way for those countries to ensure that their vital national interests were not overturned or upset , in particular as regards the doctrine of conferral within that Treaty , clarifying the issues of subsidiarity and proportionality , as well as ensuring the continuation of equality between all Member States and in the application of the rules . #% From this shabby performance we have more than enough evidence that standards of environmental controls are far from good enough and I hope today 's adoption of the MAATEN report leads to further pressure for improvement . #% 
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives . #% When you declared the vote open on the first vote , we were voting on the second part , because that was what the interpreter told us before you corrected yourself . #% Our debate today is on the future of Europe and I might take that as a point of departure . #% It has already been mentioned that the Conference for Climate Change will be held in Bonn from 16-27 July 2001 . #% The day after its publication , it was reported that the UN Secretary-General would only launch an international investigation if the Sri Lankan Government agrees or an international forum such as the UN Foreign Security Council calls for an inquiry . #% On the contrary , we want to see the dismantling of nuclear institutions which , if they are involved in bad accidents , could certainly bring a lot of ruin and disaster to the Member States of the European Union . #% The restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances , on the one hand , and the prevention of waste electrical and electronic equipment on the other is what we are talking about here in the two directives before us . #% We are approaching - if we are not already there - the watershed of the history of the Union . #% All European countries should implement all the various directives as required . #% We are a multi-billion pound , multi-billion dollar talking-shop , as far as the citizens of Europe and the world are concerned . #% What we are paying for is an agriculture that is environmentally sound , guarantees the highest levels of food safety and traceability and upholds standards of animal welfare . #% We should not go along with the US missile defence system . #% But the enlargement of the European Union is a real success story . #% You are saying that you want a defence policy and defence system , not to protect yourself against potential aggressors , but to protect your fundamental selfish interests . #% Finally , I urge you to take up the issue of debt cancellation for developing countries . #% Mr President , thank you Mr Soulier for your introduction . #% It demonstrates that people are aware that there is a body there that can help them , and the fact that the Ombudsman 's office refers them to the appropriate area where they may receive a resolution of their problem is an important service . #% Because of time constraints I will briefly make just two points . #% We need concrete action , not just repetitions of wish lists and words . #% An on-call official veterinarian must be informed about the route prior to the departure of any horse transported in dedicated transport in an outbreak . #% The new DCI will , for the first time , enshrine in a legal text the internationally accepted definition of development policy set out by the OECD Development Assistance Committee . #% However , we have not overlooked the weaknesses in the system and our motion for a resolution proposes changes and improvements both in planning and administration . #% Second , while enhancing the effectiveness of the fight against cross-border crime , I am concerned at a proposal to extend qualified majority voting to issues relating to criminal law . #% in writing . - Tax fraud and tax evasion result in an estimated EUR 200 billion being lost each year - money stolen from taxpayers in the rich world and the neediest in the developing world . #% It is in the interest of both the EU and the United States that the present rift in our relationship be healed . #% By bringing Turkey into the Western way of thinking in relation to issues such as human rights , we can best influence them . #% I would just like to mention my concerns about my own country . #% That is what the whole principle of the European project is about . #% I should also like to welcome in particular paragraph 37 of the report in which there is a proposal to mobilize local and regional authorities , together with the close participation of Community and women 's groups who are active in promoting heritage and culture at grass-roots level . #% Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure ? #% It is basically only a political promise . #% I would appeal to all national governments , including Ireland , not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here . #% In Ireland , such fears have not been grounded on concrete economic analysis but on anecdotal evidence of the negative change that the Services Directive bring . #% I am not afraid to be dismissed as a merchant of doom when I hold a view borne out by hard scientific data , compiled in an independent study on behalf of the Irish Government . #% That is why I abstained in this vote . #% However , in order to secure the trust and commitment of Europe 's agricultural community , the new CAP needs to offer stability to farmers and a fair price , as is currently provided , for the goods which they produce . #% We must remember , we have a duty and a responsibility to the Community fishermen and we must ensure that their rights are protected . #% In relation to mass-medication , it is completely unacceptable in terms of freedom of choice that 9 million UK citizens and 2.7 million Irish citizens are being forcibly mass-medicated . #% I do not understand why the Commission is playing into the hands of the Member States . #% Any proposal to give the European Council the power of qualified majority voting on justice and home affairs would be , I believe , very unwise . #% I also fully support the proposal that the European Maritime Safety Agency should be involved in recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers and hope that the Agency will prioritise this particular area with a view to ensuring greater safety for workers and citizens . #% In the longer term , Eastern and Central European countries seeking to join the European Union will want to participate in the single European currency system . #% I am , however , somewhat concerned at the motivation underlying attempts by Israel to delay the investigation . #% We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are . #% I have no doubt that over the next ten days there will be further intensification of dialogue between all contracting parties in an effort to broker an agreement for a new European Union Treaty . #% The present situation , with 15 different Member States implementing 15 different customs regimes , is not conducive to success . #% I only have two points I want to make . #% This resolution does not fully reflect the negotiating priorities agreed by the PPE and the PSE in the McCarthy/Hatzidakis resolution and , as such , can only give a partial and partisan view of Parliament 's priorities . #% In 1997 the Council requested an in-depth analysis of the EU third country agreements . #% A constitution by its very nature requires and needs the endorsement of the people . #% They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment . #% It is very important to approach this with clarity so people can understand exactly what has been proposed by both the Commission and Parliament . #% However , we must accept as credible the explanation given by the Commission , which I certainly do . #% Securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the Union . #% I did not believe that Turkey would change overnight because we had a customs union . #% ` We pay , they spend ' simply will not do . #% Much of the debate , therefore , about opening up rail links and so forth to some extent goes over our heads . #% The Research and Training Networks should also be continued , particularly the flexible support they have given under FP5 and FP6 to a positive mix of both ` early-stage researchers ' and ` experienced researchers ' . #% I think of my own country in this context , with its poor road , rail and inland waterway infrastructure . #% I can not understand why , if we have a system of transparency and open competition , how we can not prevent that from being used as a protectionist smoke screen in the publication of tenders . #% Like its predecessor , the Constitution , it foundered on the rock of democracy . #% I , however , could do anything , no matter how dangerous , because I was a home carer . #% in writing . - The Fine Gael members of the EPP Group voted in favour of Draft amending budget No 8/2009 . #% I wish to assure him that the common Council position , adopted on 28 October , makes provision for further restrictive measures against Burma to be considered and in this context the presidency will continue to monitor developments , including the implementation of the common position , and report regularly to the Council on this matter . #% For example , let us not forget the recent conflict in the Balkans where we were criticised for our impotence . #% They are innovative and visionary and are an appropriate response to the changing circumstances in which we live . #% 
Thank you for your response , President-in-Office . #% I congratulate Ms McKenna on her report . #% I consider the International Fund for Ireland to be an essential part of the confidence-building process for the communities , alongside the peace and reconciliation programme . #% This is absolutely bizarre and I would like you to inquire into this , Mr President . #% The amount of money that has been privately donated has been extraordinary . #% We think that indeed there may be a burden but more empiricism and more reflection may have helped . #% I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint . #% Article 10 requires Member States to actively cooperate with the Commission in dealing with complaints , to clarify facts and to state official positions . #% President Milosevic has a ten-year record of terror and manipulation . #% Whatever savings can be made from agriculture will be necessary to prevent the environmental , and indeed the economic , deterioration of rural Europe as it is . #% Therefore I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to bring up this matter immediately at the next Council meeting , if possible so that there will be no more delays , so that opportunities will no longer be denied to many students who have not benefited up to now , or whose parents have had to pay for them to study abroad ; and so that these anomalies and inequalities will be removed in future . #% That is why it is unfortunate that some of the brilliant ideas from the Presidency on the future it envisages for the European Union have not been taken up properly . #% Mr President , earlier this year , I had the honour to be part of a delegation from the European Parliament to New Delhi and Nepal . #% Could I remind my colleague , Jonathan Evans , that the decision in Lisbon was for the most competitive European economy in the world based on social inclusion , social cohesion and territorial cohesion . #% This means the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories . #% The whole drugs issue in Europe and the way people deal with it is very disturbing . #% Finally , I wish to pay tribute to the Commissioner . #% Some children are fortunate enough to receive this care from secondary care-givers like fathers , grandparents , other relatives , close neighbours - people who are committed to them and part of their life on an ongoing basis . #% I appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to lay down a negotiated settlement based on existing agreements . #% While I can not say that it will never happen again , I can say that finally the veil of secrecy has been lifted . #% As was saying , it is important that we reflect on what has taken place . #% One abuse can not justify another . #% By coming down from the present position to 150 GWP , there is at least a ten-fold decrease -- 1000 % -- in emissions and there would be negligible extra benefit -- about 2.6 % -- in setting a GWP threshold at 50 . #% I believe , as does the Committee on Fisheries , that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires . #% Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective . #% The proposals are encouraging , but it is far from clear how they will be implemented and funded . #% It has been ignored for too long , it is an absolute outrage and the Government in Khartoum can not be allowed to get away with it any longer . #% The budget this year is 2 % more in real terms than we started with last year , and in real terms it is more than 5 % , when you consider the outturn . #% There still is , as Commissioner Kallas said earlier , a problem in certain areas of human rights . #% I would , however , like to take issue with the rapporteur 's insistence that a reform of the common agricultural policy is a necessary part of the process of integrating the developing countries into the world trading system . #% Climate change is happening very quickly , so that reorientation will be inevitable . #% This includes public participation and the drawing up of certain plans and programmes , greater participation in the procedure concerning the implementation of environmental impact assessment statements as well as in the putting in place of integrated pollution prevention and control measures . #% Self-regulation or co-regulation ? #% We need to encourage early intervention and ensure that , if possible , as was suggested by my colleague Mr Bowis , we look again at legislation on discrimination to see if we can include discrimination against those with mental health problems as part of that package . #% I appeal through the President to my colleague to look at this again . #% The opportunities provided by this protocol for EU fisheries companies , combined with the process of privatisation in Chilean fisheries , threaten the sustainability of the artisanal fisheries sector . #% The fact that half the new projects fail within five years surely indicates that we have neglected to provide their promoters with assistance in the research , market development and management skills which are so essential for their survival . #% The Sellafield lies , leaks and cover-ups saga has been consistently denounced by my Fianna Fáil delegation in this Parliament , right back to the early days of Windscale . #% It is vitally important that the parties proceed with the implementation of the Roadmap elaborated by the international community , and that each side fully meets their obligations under this plan . #% It is also important that consumers have sufficient information and legal redress , either through the law courts or through ADR systems . #% The Foreign Minister in Ireland has clarified with the British Ambassador to Ireland and the German Ambassador to London , that there is no objection by the German Government to her release from jail . #% Without equality there can be no equal opportunity and that has to be fundamental to our approach to this issue of women participating in decision-making . #% Mr President , I welcome the fact that you recognise the need for a coordinated EU response , but I put it to you that not only does it need to be coordinated , it needs to be comprehensive and backed up by sufficient resources . #% It is time for the EU to get tough on counterfeiting and piracy . #% A common minimum standard of security is needed not only because of the real threat of aviation crime , but also for the perceived threat that a lack of security shows the public . #% By mainstreaming health into all EU policies , by conducting extended health impact assessments and evaluations on all EU legislation and by promoting healthy lifestyles , the EU can provide the necessary platform for joined-up thinking across its Member States . #% It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation . #% Community and local authority recycling facilities need to be practically located and accessible for maximum impact . #% The European Union approach must be governed by three key principles : ensuring safe water supplies , arresting the decline of water quality and the restoration of polluted waters . #% While the current crisis is undoubtedly devastating , it also offers opportunity : opportunity to change our way of thinking ; opportunity to build a strengthening framework for sustainable growth that can withstand potential shocks ; and opportunity to build a sound economic and social base for the future . #% In recent days , the Commission has approved excise relief for a bio-ethanol pilot project in Ireland using rapeseed oil and I particularly welcome that . #% This can be a help , but on its own is no panacea for all the problems facing the rural dweller . #% We would have the resources for investment in research and development , fighting climate change and in building solidarity between the regions of the EU . #% It is quite clear that it should be explicit and if it is already implied then I do not see what the problem is about ensuring that it is explicit because as time goes by radioactive substances are going to pose an even greater danger and - as I have already said - we are very lucky that there has not already been a serious accident . #% I do not exaggerate . #% We must ensure that measures are both environment - and family-friendly . #% It is , frankly , the best fuel . #% The Common position offers the most appropriate means of ensuring that we can achieve the objective of guaranteeing that employees have real access to information and consultation , and also offers them an opportunity to have an input into the continuing operation of the enterprise . #% In Ireland VRT totals EUR 1.15 billion , which is a huge amount in a very small country . #% Unfortunately , even if all these extensive repairs and the construction of an effective and secure shelter for reactor 4 can be completed quickly , there will be no guarantees and , in my view , no question but the whole project will still be environmentally unsafe because the technology to render the dismantled reactor safe , on the one hand , and to eliminate the radioactive waste , on the other , does not yet exist . #% We have a model in Australia and New Zealand which could usefully be copied in the European Union Member States . #% We would like to keep Europol 's remit and scope small and specific and thereby make the agency as efficient and effective as possible . #% The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically . #% While incineration is getting a lot of adverse publicity , and recent planning decisions in Ireland have certainly raised the crucial question of the location of incinerators , it is difficult to envisage a complete programme of waste disposal without incineration , particularly in relation to toxic waste , and in this regard consideration must be given to finding locations where the facility will not impact badly on the natural environment . #% There is no surer way to bring about the downfall and disintegration of this Union than to make laws that Member States do not ensure are then observed . #% Such an act would be a clear infringement of subsidiarity . #% 
There are a number of key things we can do in the coming Council meeting to try and drive things forward . #% I think that the citizen 's right to make a complaint is a good thing . #% Another matter on which the Committee on Petitions has been lobbied intensely is the difficulties many teachers experience working in other Member States . #% We really need an extremely tight clampdown on how mining industries operate and a future directive on mining waste is extremely important . #% In that sense , I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that . #% Someone mentioned the EU imposing stringent measures in this sector in Europe . #% As you have quite rightly said , the areas and the budget lines affected are those which are closest to the citizens and which , coincidentally , have been put in by the Members themselves . #% Some courts have put a question mark about the operation of the European Arrest Warrant , whether as regards its transposition into international law by the mechanism used or as regards the way that certain courts have interpreted elements of the arrest warrant process . #% I would firstly like to make my key point and then we can discuss the wider issue . #% Here is a situation within the European Union that has been going on for a long time . #% Neither the `` no '' campaign nor the `` yes '' campaign made an issue of enlargement . #% Like many people , I too , Madam President , was disappointed that the recent Middle East peace talks in Camp David did not culminate in a peace settlement between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government . #% My fear with regard to this is that monies that are badly needed for the Irish naval service to upgrade its fleet and to cover 140 , 000 square miles of territorial waters , not only protecting the Irish coastline but also protecting a European frontier and European fishing ground , would be diverted into some other area . #% What is happening here is that we have looked at all sides of it and we have come down , on balance , in favour of employment . #% Indeed , we could even call it fraudulent accounting practice . #% We have paid lip service to it but have not been able to resolve the problem . #% The EU certainly now has a golden opportunity to put in place new policies in the fields of consumer rights , food safety and assistance to the elderly , as well as areas of environmental protection . #% This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually . #% I also ask you to appeal to the Irish and British Governments to use whatever intermediaries they have with the IRA to seek more precise information about the location of those five unfortunate victims of IRA terror . #% I would like to support very much what the last speaker has just said . #% We also must remember that waste does not disappear . #% Regrettably its blind allegiance is paradoxically damaging to Israel 's cause . #% First of all , there is nothing wrong with legitimate arms trade and legitimate EU arms exports consistent with a working code of conduct . #% We need millions of people to make decisions which do not seem obvious to them . #% I regret the intolerant anti-European rejection of subsidiarity by some colleagues this afternoon . #% The point I would like to raise with the Commissioner relates to the whole question of the transposition and implementation of directives . #% I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on the motion on Uzbekistan . #% It is extremely important . #% Consequently , the European company would not have reaped the benefits and , indeed , there could have been an infringement of a patent owned by a multinational . #% The European Council decided to participate in international efforts to restore stability and peace to Afghanistan . #% I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish . #% I will ensure that the honourable Member 's views are taken into account . #% I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification , quality and consumer satisfaction . #% We need accurate information across all 25 Member States , collected in a uniform way , so that we have good-quality , reliable and relevant information to underpin all policy decisions . #% There might be a perception that the IFI is an American programme while the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is a European one . #% In particular , renewable energies need to be promoted throughout Europe . #% These decisions and discussions are not taking place at an honest level within the Member States , and especially within the neutral countries : the public is being misled . #% In building close relations between the Union and Iran -- which has a population of over 70 million people -- it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption , political prejudice and political coercion . #% It is only the burden of proof -- on the Commission under Article 175 , on the Member State under Article 95 -- and the enforcement procedures which are different . #% We have done that this year but we can not continue to do it for ever . #% Here , the Commission conveniently forgets that before the economic boom the citizens of our country were required to make major sacrifices in order to achieve that boom . #% I look forward to working closely with the Commission in ensuring that more EU regulations and directives on this subject are implemented in the near future . #% The European Union can do some things . #% The Union must ensure that European companies remain competitive in the international marketplace and that our countries remain attractive destinations for mobile investment and job-creation projects by overseas companies . #% Market support measures will be essential in providing adequate safety nets against extreme market volatility which is likely to be a feature of the market in the future . #% If we do it now , we may well have to do it in the future in a one-stock fishery . #% According to a recent OECD survey , the substance has a similar structure and toxicity to PFOS and thus should be phased out accordingly . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , despite the short time available to me , there are three points that I want to raise . #% Other countries have had similar experiences . #% The campaign that must be waged against pirate fishing is a global and multifaceted one . #% It is time to stop the political games and get on with the real agenda of making the Lisbon Strategy work , of ensuring that the people of Europe have better access to better-quality jobs and better-quality opportunities and of promoting Europe 's role on the wider stage . #% This issue relates to the Irish referendum . #% Now is the time for the new Member States to ensure that they have real regional authorities -- not just paper tigers -- otherwise they may find that the Irish experience will be their experience tomorrow . #% - I wish to state the reasons why I felt obliged to abstain on the final vote , even though , in common with other Members , I am totally in favour of the protection of fundamental freedoms and rights , and with ensuring that future social developments can be taken account of . #% Mr President , I do not have the rule book in front of me but I simply want to add a clarification to the statement on Northern Ireland made by Mr Allister who criticised President McAleese of the Irish Republic for remarks she made concerning the Protestant community in Northern Ireland . #% We do not know what the exact result of a vaccine will be on the human body when trying to prevent the spread of avian flu , and will not know until such time as we allow our scientific experts to act and entrust this matter to people who know what they are talking about . #% It is the definitive view of our group , and has been consistently the case , that the amendment of this article would be a form of Trojan horse . #% I should say that the United Kingdom presidency brought with it great enthusiasm , energy and a high quality of organizational ability which we all very much appreciate . #% Mr President , I also wish to join in the congratulations to Sue Waddington on her report and to say that the Group Union for Europe will be more than happy to give full support to the report and all its contents , because it is a very balanced one . #% Nonetheless , we do consider that Member States should define adequacy as the condition required for older people to live a decent life . #% However , it is not acceptable that so many farmers are given no alternative but to withdraw from farming because of the impossibility of making a reasonable income . #% We have suffered enough for far too long and we want a better life for everyone . #% We are told they will increase by 40 % on current rates . #% The new proposal brings us a further step forward by hopefully ensuring that each Member State will take the necessary measures to guarantee that facilitating or in any way profiting from child prostitution or child pornography is penalised , including by terms of imprisonment of not less than four years . #% The latest statement , for example , by a British scientist that the disease is transmitted by cows to their unborn calves is creating further doubts in the minds of consumers . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank both Commissioners . #% 
The Commission should provide much more resources because the task that they are doing will certainly improve the lot of fishermen throughout the EU . #% But most of the instruments which can affect the growth of employment are still in the hands of the Member States . #% I say that particularly because of the commitment of the Irish presidency to job creation and , hopefully , also to rural development . #% I welcome the enactment of new codes of judicial procedure and criminal procedure and the establishment of a standing committee to investigate complaints of torture and a national programme to eliminate poverty . #% What is going to be the situation on the beef market ? #% Our current system is complex and reflects the fact that the issue was fudged 20 years ago with direct elections . #% The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds . #% I believe the proposed amendments will improve the efficiency of Cedefop 's administrative procedures , and am particularly glad to see that they will lead to a balanced representation of men and women by addressing this issue in the whole chain of the nomination and election procedure . #% Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2 % in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion , and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64 % of this figure . #% All too often in Member States , the abduction of a child is treated by the police and other authorities simply as a domestic rather than a criminal matter . #% Therefore , we should study how that was done and how the philosophy behind it was sent to every area of conflict . #% They were promised over and over again that the income aids were permanent and would be fully financed . #% Although these proposals are very necessary and overdue in the context of the hushkits regulation and the US complaint and , indeed , the recent opinion of the Advocate General , the UK Government 's position points out some flaws in the Commission 's approach . #% That can best be done through a new federalism based on a European constitution . #% One particular problem , Commissioner , is an arms embargo - not just in Burundi - but let us begin with Burundi and then let us look at how we can bring about control of armaments coming from the European Union , which contribute to the terribly sad situations we see occurring in Burundi , in Rwanda and in other regions . #% Perhaps we are too ambitious or too wide-ranging with regard to the areas that we want to see included . #% If it is in any way damaged , there will be serious implications for rural society in Europe in the future . #% The aim of this proposal is to provide for the participation of Switzerland in the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes . #% We export 90 % of our entire production , be it processed or live . #% In this situation and with this directive , we have struck a balance . #% We are calling for this in the context of the UN 's responsibility to protect , based on the failure of the Sudanese Government to protect its own population from war crimes and crimes against humanity , and a failure to provide humanitarian assistance to the population . #% in writing . - MEP Schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety through the introduction of increased safety measures requirements for car manufacturers . #% I think that what we really have to do is show courage now in laying down clear standards and guidelines of what we expect from our partners with regard to their relationships . #% This directive , as a piece of intellectual property legislation , must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries , which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports . #% The biggest threat to Ireland at the moment is wage inflation fuelled by 75,000 job vacancies . #% There are many fledgling industries , such as the rape-seed oil industry , that need to be financially promoted and supported . #% We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya . #% Finally , I would like to refer briefly to the ethical aspects of research . #% They help impoverished regions . #% I also welcome the proposal for the political pillar of ASEM to encourage political dialogue in several areas , including between China and Taiwan . #% Let us be clear : Amendment No 26 does not promote a free ride for public broadcasters on conditional access services nor indeed on imposing or mandating this . #% Ultimately , however , this Commission was the author of its own demise . #% Nothing I have heard in this debate would cause me to change my mind . #% That doctor said : ` SOLVIT has restored my confidence in the internal market ' . #% Therefore , we must ensure that governments are seen to be playing an active role in that regard . #% It is to be welcomed that the agricultural situation has improved , and that experience and the reorganized CAP have created a better and more transparent state of affairs . #% I hope the Commission can accept both those amendments . #% We must call Milosevic 's bluff . #% Will you take on board the point that eggs within the EU produced unlawfully after 1 January 2012 will either have the same stamp , will not be allowed to be exported outside the country in which they are produced or will not be allowed to go onto the market ? #% So I think we make too much of that issue . #% My group commends in particular the progress made by the Baltic States , in the economic field in Lithuania and in human rights in Latvia . #% That says it in a nutshell . #% However , with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU , export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them . #% Mr President , I welcome the great role that Parliament has in the process of Agenda 2000 . #% They need to be brought under the correct protection of the directive and I fully support Amendment No 5 calling for a maximum transition period of five years . #% This will provide them with remuneration for their work and valuable work experience , which I hope will assist them in their future careers . #% We should be under no illusion that in time co-financing of the CAP will inevitably lead to its renationalisation . #% It would appear as if they are lining up a deal and will be using agricultural standards as a currency to buy a deal with Mercosur countries . #% We will not be divided or have our role as a legislature ignored . #% I support the objective underlying the question put by the honourable Member . #% The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe . #% Do we have a view on the psychological impact , not just on farmers , but on the entire EU population , young and old , of the non-stop display on our television screens of truckloads of dead and decomposing animals ? #% They would mean thousands of job losses throughout Europe in aircraft refuelling , servicing , cleaning , passenger handling and baggage registration . #% As co-legislator , we must be able to control , on an equal footing with the Council , the adoption and the execution of strategic decisions on the spending of development aid : how much , where and how . #% A patent for these techniques has been granted in the UK since August of 1995 . #% Finally , the European Union is the natural home of the Irish , both geographically and politically . #% Having burned the people of the Darfur region of Sudan into graves and refugee camps , they have created a militarised zone -- a terror zone -- that separates Sudan , north and south . #% Mr President , we are certainly in the same boat so to speak . #% It is only right and proper where there is a system of wholesale freedom of movement of persons and cross-border traffic that a streamlined and structured procedure is in operation so that recourse is available to injured parties in the case of accidents . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report . #% I give the example of the LEADER programme . #% Both the fishing industry and the Committee on Fisheries claim that they agree with the need to conserve stocks and protect the marine environment . #% I should also like to inform you that in the Member States , particularly in the UK , questions are being raised concerning your support for reprocessing in some of your statements . #% I believe my colleagues are wrong when they say we should not use this as a debate on the role of China . #% We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO . #% Please single out health services , consider the benchmark of good regulation , and deal with this specific area in a more appropriate way . #% 
A ban such as that to which I am referring is being introduced in Britain after four years of extensive research and consultation . #% It is a tangible way of bringing Europe closer to the citizens and I would support the view that this card should , in fact , have a European logo and should be very clearly identified as a European benefit for citizens . #% The resolution urges the Commission to verify Member States ' correct transposition , implementation and national enforcement of the directive and to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible , notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories . #% Doing so will have no adverse affects on the commendable work that is being done for small business but will send out a strong message that we must take a stand against unproductive , unwieldy and ill-conceived proposals that will be of no benefit to the European economy . #% Women imprisoned in jails anywhere in the Community must be treated properly and with dignity . #% On this historic occasion I want to say that I hope all Member States will join the single currency before too long . #% I am very pleased that research is being carried out with regard to the concern about toys . #% In particular , the fact that we live in such a rapidly changing world brought about through innovation and technology requires a more rapid response from the European Union to ensure that we can defend as best as possible the interests of all EU citizens . #% This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation . #% The same goes for interpretation and translation for many defendants . #% I have also supported paragraph 10 , simply because if one wants to reduce the number of abortions , one should recognise the right of individuals to avail of counselling about sex education , including counselling about responsibilities in relationships and information about contraception . #% The challenge is now whether some elite have the honestly and integrity to admit that the Treaty is dead . #% Finally , the Council , the Commission , Parliament and the Court of Justice all have representatives from each Member State at present , a fact which contributes significantly to the legitimacy which these institutions enjoy in each of our countries . #% Today there are 6.5 billion people in the world and Europe makes up only 9 % of it . #% At the same time there is a need for an important balance between the Commission , Parliament and the rights of governments . #% I hope that interest rates will be harmonized as time goes on . #% This is the proper approach as taxation matters are best left to be decided by the individual Member States ' governments . #% However , in spite of these concerns , which I hope to alter by amendment later via the legislative process , I vote in favour . #% The WTO has set up a committee on regional trade agreements to monitor new and existing regional trade groupings . #% It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we can strengthen the fight against fraud and protect the interests of all taxpayers in Europe . #% Therefore , I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries , could navigate it quickly and efficiently , as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings , requiring people to read a third , half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested . #% Rural development is going to make a very important contribution to the future of rural society . #% It is a signal of the importance that the Commission attaches to this issue . #% Parliament continually needs to receive assurances to its satisfaction . #% I am glad that has been tackled . #% As a representative of the East coast of Ireland , I have always resented the Irish Sea being used as a rubbish tip for the activities of British Nuclear Fuels . #% Last November , the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter . #% Mr President , you would be perfectly right . #% Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements , and these are for export to Community markets . #% Ireland has a long sporting tradition , and in particular an amateur and voluntary tradition . #% So the accession countries have to be warned about the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they continue to violate human rights . #% Energy taxes need to be carefully thought about . #% The Commission must also make effective use of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to intensify contacts and cooperation with Iranian civil society and independent media and to support democracy and respect for human rights in Iran . #% The buck must stop somewhere . #% There will be risks , but we have to explain to our people why we can not do other than proceed . #% However , regions like mine , which have not and still do not qualify for cohesion funding , have greater difficulty in bringing their water treatment infrastructure up to acceptable standards . #% Although there have been differences within the European Union as to how best to deal with Iraq , we are all agreed now that the European Union must remain at the forefront of this reconstruction effort . #% Finally I have just come from a meeting of the Intergroup on Ageing . #% If it does , nobody will have an overall view of what is happening ; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future . #% Who are the United States to decide , for political reasons , that a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament is not allowed to enter ? #% You can not , on the one hand , pay lip-service to the fight against terrorism if , on the other hand , you overlook what is actually happening within a Member State of the European Union . #% Nevertheless , it is important that we maintain pressure on the Chinese Government to improve the political and human rights situation in China . #% Yet , in any country in Europe there are employers and businesses crying out for staff and they claim they can not get them . #% Mr President , we all agree on the need to allow companies across Europe to run the EU-wide sales promotions . #% First , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response . #% My own country has a particular problem with the Schengen Agreement , not with the principle of it , but because of a long traditional arrangement with our nearest neighbour and because of a border situation with Northern Ireland . #% I would go as far as to say that it is a derogation of our public duty to not ask questions about this serious issue . #% I do not think we should . #% In a debate yesterday on the situation in Iraq , a deeply respected French colleague said that it was hardly the time to lay blame when men , women and children were dying in this tragic war . #% People recognize it as a human issue and , while we are not going about it strictly speaking as lawyers , through Parliament we have considerable influence in putting pressure on local authorities who might be ignoring these cases assuming them just to be domestic tiffs . #% We are now producing something like 27 % of our needs from farmed fish and there is no reason why we can not continue . #% What steps can be taken to make sure that the Kyoto Protocol remains the firm basis for future negotiations and action to reduce emissions ? #% We have considerable experience with the original rather limited liberalisation directive in our Member States . #% in writing . - There are many issues in this resolution which I support . #% We demand fiscal neutrality of the states . #% The international community , in particular the United Nations , has to ask itself some searching and probing questions . #% In the context of the mid-term review proposals due to be adopted this week and the forthcoming world trade talks , I appeal to the Greek Presidency to work towards continued commitment at EU level for the European agricultural model and to guarantee a decent livelihood for our farmers . #% There is a huge amount of business to vote on . #% Why has the Commission gone down the route of a voluntary approach ? #% It is only by ensuring peace and security , democracy and political stability , that Nigeria can haul itself out of poverty and create a wealth and social justice which will in turn lead people away from violence as a method of conflict resolution . #% There will always be demand for live cattle exports . #% One thing this highlights is that great results can be achieved when the EU institutions pool their collective intelligence . #% Secondly , the Heads of State and of Government took the view in Amsterdam that there was no compelling case to involve Parliament in the administration of the common agricultural policy . #% The way to do that for the European Union should be as follows : instead of sending armies to areas of conflict , we should be sending the philosophy and principles of peace , plus a large team of officials to promote dialogue . #% I believe that the European Union and the United States working together will do their very best to get the talks under way . #% Indeed , I have proposed in Ireland that vat on labour for such work should be reduced from 13.5 % to 5 % to encourage retention of jobs and demand for these renovations . #% 
The long term consequences will be that we go back a hundred years to where people will be dying from diseases which presently can be cured by antibiotics . #% It is very much in the interests of smokers to know exactly what chemicals are contained in tobacco products and for them to be able to exercise informed choice . #% Indeed we have fish killed in our rivers and lakes and this is an annual occurrence . #% Therefore , we have no data on a decision to include self-employed drivers . #% Computer-implemented inventions are present , as the Commissioner has said , in everyday household appliances , from safety devices such as airbags in cars to mobile phones , washing machines and an endless list of other devices with relevance going well beyond the traditional computer industries to the heart of our manufacturing sectors . #% The explanation must be available , it must be clear and it must be transmitted by a willing media . #% The Irish government have , in contravention of the law , nominated a person who not only has no experience of economic or financial affairs , but is furthermore a disgraced supreme court judge who was forced to resign before he was impeached by the Irish parliament . #% But I am not for adopting cosmetic exercises . #% Let us make it known that the Regional Fund can contribute to the national programmes , supporting initiatives to fight and prevent crime . #% It all boils down to the fact that other than putting forward a draft resolution at the 55th human rights meeting in Geneva , where we stated our position , we have done nothing else since because we have no information whatsoever with regard to the 598 Kuwaiti men and seven women who were sent to Iraqi prisons . #% In the interests of mankind we have a responsibility to keep searching for the right answers . #% In the limited time at my disposal , I want to concentrate on his proposal in paragraph 6 for the carrying out of a feasibility study into the establishment of a military and police unit responsible for keeping and restoring the peace . #% So it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States - and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government , the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member . #% Thirdly , the techniques , costs , etc. and financing of decommissioning . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris . #% With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe , we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which , of course , is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade . #% The people of the Balkans are entitled to full and unequivocal answers with regard to the carcenogenic effects of the depleted uranium shells which were used during the war . #% For this reason , my group has tabled an amendment which proposes excluding lime and dolime production from the gas emissions trading scheme . #% I should like to put a few specific questions to the Commissioner . #% These are consultative-only as far as Parliament is concerned . #% Even in this Parliament , if we are honest , we do not coordinate our efforts : the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy and the Committee on Transport and Tourism are not making a cohesive policy move which would help us to meet the obligations we entered into at Kyoto . #% However we must find a system that will allow the countries concerned and the Commission to monitor fishing agreements effectively and ensure that there is no over-exploitation of the limited resources . #% I also wish to say that the PSE Group will not accept amendments to this report which seek to weaken it . #% President , it is appropriate to reflect for a moment on how this interinstitutional agreement comes to be before us today for debate . #% It is also important that the EU leads the way in establishing fundamental rights for the approximately 660 million people world-wide who have some form of disability - almost 10 % of the planet 's population . #% As far as Mr Schwaiger is concerned , he is absolutely right to say that we must have , before long , some sort of aquis communautaire in the sector of nuclear safety . #% A major error in the installation of dishwashers and washing machines over the years -- certainly in my country and , I suspect , elsewhere -- has contributed greatly to this problem of foam in water systems . #% However , it seems to me that , in its emphasis , the Commission gives primacy to removing obstacles to the provision of services and the orderly functioning of the internal market . #% It is a dismal record . #% We do not always get it right in our part of the world , but let us look at the women 's issue in Saudi Arabia and move ahead on that together . #% Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union . #% We can not disguise the fact that the decision of the Israel security cabinet to remove President Arafat from the Occupied Territories has led to a deteriorating situation in the Middle East . #% Secondly , would you not also agree that our aid to Palestine in fact contributes to eliminating the sort of conditions in which terrorism thrives ? #% However , it has to be acknowledged from the outset that there is little the EU can do to resolve the situation . #% Constitutional challenge is often quoted in Ireland as one of our reasons . #% But the idea itself is worth exploring . #% On behalf of my group I would like to propose that we do not agree with the rapporteur ' s request to send this back to Strasbourg for voting . #% Madam President , I was not aware of that . #% In light of this reality , I would ask the Commission to issue a particular reference to the patenting of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells . #% In my opinion the Commission and the Council have not yet addressed this issue to a sufficient extent . #% I would like to mention that the last toxic chemical , fluorosilic acid , which is used to fluoridate water supplies in my country , has the invidious effect of making other toxic substances , such as lead , mercury and aluminium , exponentially more dangerous . #% So let us meet the percentage contribution we said we would make . #% Who will finance the Adaptation Fund ? #% - I wish to place on record my serious concern at the decision of the EP to seek the deletion of the Irish ( including Northern Ireland and Greece ) derogation from the full effects of this directive . #% There will be broad-ranging representation at this Convention which will afford all participants a time for real reflection as to the direction that the European Union must take in the immediate years ahead . #% The Greens sympathise with their plight and trust that appropriate compensation will be made available for those fishery workers who are put out of work in the eventuality of a halt in fishing activities . #% In 2005 and 2006 , EUR 108 million are being allocated to this fund which is supporting projects in the border county region and Northern Ireland . #% At the end of the day we should avoid complications that bring no tangible benefit to our consumers and only give ammunition to those who argue that the EU creates burdensome over-regulation . #% Let us be sensible and adopt this sound and sensible proposal or we will risk a great divergence and indeed , discordance , in the Union . #% Mr President , the sheer scale of the unprecedented flooding in China has prompted me to put down this motion for resolution expressing sympathy with the people and Government of China . #% This report is viewed with extreme concern , regardless of what the rapporteur has said with regard to the United Kingdom . #% Mr President , the fact that over 10 000 petitions have been received by the Committee on Petitions since its inception clearly demonstrates the practical significance of the European Union for its citizens . #% In the light of a recent reform of the common agricultural policy , the current position of Parliament , which would suggest cofinancing , will not be viewed very well by our farmers and rural dwellers . #% I know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign , and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of Europe . #% We have been so busy reconstituting ourselves we have not yet had the capacity to do our homework and our research , so if the hearings bring to light issues of substance and public concern about which we as yet know nothing , we in this House would have a duty to Europe to act and we will act - certainly , my group will . #% On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement . #% Now is the time for each of us , on both sides of the pond , to take a step back and allow things to calm down . #% We had an excellent presentation from the officer from Europol , Mr Morgan , and I also had the pleasure of announcing the agreement that I think had just been published in the papers that day . #% Setting Latvian workers against Swedish workers will destroy the Union , Commissioner . #% The WHO radiation expert has gone on record about the opposition to this project encountered at all stages of its development . #% The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion . #% in writing . - I strongly support this report . #% This Parliament can help by raising the issue and also potentially by providing finance , as stated in the motion for a resolution . #% We can all recall that the Kyoto Accord sets down a timetable for the reduction in the level of the use of greenhouse gases . #% Finally , the European Union should look again at its policy of supporting NATO and the Western European Union . #% However , the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid . #% 
There are also other matters , like agriculture and fisheries , to deal with . #% The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is : Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime ? #% However , in terms of what we must do now , the most important issue that you must address is the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Peace , democracy and prosperity are as important today as they were fifty years ago . #% At the moment people are just learning what it is about , getting their programme off the ground , and now they are concerned that it might not continue after the end of 1999 . #% This is the first time the Commission has submitted an annual report based on a complete year of operation of the Cohesion Fund and it is the first time this Parliament has had the opportunity of examining how the Cohesion Fund has been implemented in the beneficiary Member States . #% We recognise the sovereignty of the Nigerian people and their federal government and we are increasingly aware that there is a global community and every citizen of the global community is entitled to our solidarity and respect . #% Nothing they have said nor any utterances from Harbinson 's mouth leave me with confidence that we are going to benefit from playing our cards up front . #% We also stress in this report that we are concerned about the lack of progress on Equitable Life , on which the Petitions Committee did some work in 2007 and on which I chaired the Committee of Inquiry . #% After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track . #% Four or five very hard criminals may be given soft sentences to convict one . #% The Council 's suggestions have been rejected by everybody directly involved in the industry - in particular by the airlines and the trade unions - and this must tell us something . #% I congratulate the rapporteur on this fine report . #% It is totally unacceptable to suggest reopening the Luxembourg Accord of last year . #% I am in some difficulty regarding a particular case because it is sub judice . #% As previous speakers have already said , it is being considered at an opportune time . #% Iraq was given technology and weapons to pursue that war . #% The cost of the new building is unjustifiable . #% Mr President , could I object to yesterday 's Minutes . #% Mrs Green made a very valid point about 35 , 000 Turkish troops in the northern part of Cyprus . #% How can anybody have any control over what they do or what they bring back ? #% The whole issue of unfair competition which people are criticising is caused by the fact that the industry itself is exploiting workers in certain parts of the world . #% Mr President , on a point of order and to clarify what I said earlier on , during the vote on the period of reflection , in the split vote relating to paragraph 2 of Amendment 2 , you requested a roll-call vote but then changed your mind and said the first part of that split vote would be checked . #% If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives . #% It can no longer simply be argued that this is an internal matter for the British . #% It is essential that the primacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted . #% We would agree with the Commission that fleets are too large and must be reduced . #% This House does not appear to read its own documents . #% I was in what was then Rhodesia in the 1960s and there was a great deal of injustice in that country at that time . #% The question of whether participation in the emissions trading scheme provided for under this directive should be mandatory in the pilot phase has been the subject of much debate in Member States , including Ireland . #% We must insist that the Israeli siege of Gaza and the appalling human suffering that it is causing for the 1.5 million inhabitants should be lifted immediately and without preconditions . #% We are supporting illegal weapons and we really have to look at this . #% It was taken out and this is just to reinsert it into the original text . #% The truth is that the negotiations have been long and protracted , and I certainly welcome the Commissioner 's statement that he is hoping to bring this very shortly to an end . #% I know what I am talking about in saying that , because the three principles at the heart of the European Union are exactly the same as the three principles at the heart of our special agreement in Northern Ireland . #% This would only help to erode public confidence in the institutions of the Union , which would be a very regressive step for all interested parties , particularly in the light of the key challenges that lie ahead for the Union as a political and economic entity . #% Thus , in terms of those deprived areas of Belfast that I have mentioned , I certainly will be looking for a meaningful programme of assistance . #% The proposed action plan , the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections . #% It is a great boon to the numerous voluntary organisations in all of our Member States of the EU . #% The CAP reform has changed the policy framework to ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry . #% We have to listen and allow them to make the decisions , we should not make decisions for them . #% In this report and in the Commission document , great importance is attached to the need for proper provision for social security and pensions for part-time workers . #% Would he not be convinced by the fact that Pakistan embassies are using this worldwide to rubbish our report and to say that there is something wrong with it ? #% We have them on the table ; we are going to have to give more . #% Farmers are being asked to make further reductions and sacrifices , despite being told that the 1999 reform constituted a final settlement on the CAP . #% Bearing in mind that 40 % of energy usage is for the purpose of warming or cooling our homes Member States should urgently introduce incentives for green energy solutions . #% I want better research and funding for Internet-tracing software . #% Mr President , I just wish to state that I was here yesterday but did not vote . #% The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid . #% He will have the support of many people in this Chamber . #% The body is no longer balanced and is now discriminating against the unionist community . #% Farmers in my country are already suffering a huge decline in income . #% That is the wrong road to go down . #% I agree with Allan Macartney when he suggests that the policy needs a fundamental reappraisal and that the disadvantaged areas should be given more control over both the exploitation and the marketing of the resource that is adjacent to them . #% Ensuring that the rural communities have access to basic services , such as childcare and education , is also very important . #% I also note with deep regret that just yesterday a Vietnamese court sentenced eight people to death for drug offences ; eleven people have already been sentenced to death this year . #% This would be inflationary , as would any commensurate increase in our already high annual circulation tax , resulting in car owners who had already paid VRT on existing vehicles being hit by a double whammy . #% It is amazing that so little progress has been made . #% Western governments should be asked why they do not demand that the oil-well be used to transform the lives of the people , instead of propping up this regime . #% There are three questions in one in Question 40 , which will take another 20 minutes or so . #% Those colleagues who are concerned about flags should bear in mind that if you could eat flags , there would not be a hungry child in the world . #% Mr President , first of all I must ask why we have two reports at all . #% Thirdly , within the context of cohesion funding , talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic , since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception , while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included . #% It is a day when parents like to be with their children , when grown up children visit their parents ; and in closely knit communities it is the day when people can find time to visit the sick , the aged and the lonely . #% The committee did , however , agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet . #% I hope that today 's debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation , sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals , to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market . #% 
If we are to seriously pursue our long-term aim of food security then clearly we need resources to match our aspirations . #% These investigations have to be carried out . #% To an ordinary person that is a lot of money . #% I totally agree with the comments of my colleague , Mr Poettering , when he criticised them for setting themselves up as the custodians of morality in this House . #% Ideally , I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges . #% It was a minimum requirement . #% Furthermore , it would be a betrayal of the philosophy of the founding members of this Union . #% Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe , rather than the major cities like London , Birmingham and Paris , because they will survive and receive support . #% For example , a million citizens ' signatures can prompt the Commission to draft a proposal . #% Among the blessed , he mentions Ryanair , now the most profitable airline in Europe , more profitable as a percentage of turnover than the giant BA . #% This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance , the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen , rather than dictate . #% Today in Parliament we voted against supporting the German peace proposal that has been put forward . #% Mr President , would the Council accept that the cost of maritime surveillance to Ireland is totally disproportionate to our size and population . #% The power that we have in Parliament , which we share as the Union 's budgetary authority , is perhaps the greatest responsibility that we have . #% That has not happened throughout the European Union , and we have to do something about it . #% However , we have decided to vote in favour as there are a lot of positive elements in the report , particularly its emphasis on renewable energy , which is clean , cost-effective and secure . #% The debacle over nitrates does little to endear the Commission to EU citizens . #% First , I think the Council is too big : 47 members are too many . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Herzog on an excellent report . #% We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy . #% The Commission needs reform and Union needs a strong , independent , politically reformed Commission . #% We must look not simply at the quality of water but at its location , its availability , and how it is managed . #% It is unacceptable that the industry could be allowed on exemption unless the environmental risk provisions apply . #% We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order . #% My criticism of it would be same criticism I have applied to the IRA in Ireland for very many years : that it was engaged in a useless , pointless , undemocratic way of seeking to pursue its objectives . #% Madam President , I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement . #% Finally , can I say to Mrs Fraga Estévez and to you , Mr President , there is great joy in Belfast tonight : we beat the Spanish football team 3-2 . #% A region is not about its boundaries , it is about its cultures and its languages , and , even more so , it is about its people . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate President Santer on his continuing efforts to get national governments as well as the European institutions to give this serious problem the priority it deserves . #% I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned . #% Ease of access means that dissemination should be fairly easy , but Parliament considers dissemination to be an important stage in this process . #% Is the Minister aware that the Indonesian Foreign Minister has recently taken up this case in a big way and is planning to make a presentation during the UN General Summit which takes place later on this year ? #% Most importantly , it must be remembered that the dignity of the Members of this House and their rights as elected representatives of the people of Europe must be foremost in any formulation of our rules . #% If we are serious about creating a European Union which has the support of the citizens , we must give a balanced commitment to the development of a social Europe . #% I urge sensible handling of transport and the individual identification of animals . #% It also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.7 % in the number of farms within the European Union . #% Just look at the United States ' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan . #% Madagascar makes a profit out of this that it would not otherwise receive , so its economy does benefit to some extent . #% This objective will only be achieved if it can be clearly demonstrated to the majority of people that the European Union is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that the Union can contribute to finding solutions to the problems in our society . #% I was personally aware of the explanation , which you have now given publicly . #% I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from ? #% These private , profit-orientated organisations have far too much power over sovereign governments and I fully support plans to address this anomaly at European level . #% When we talk about the whole question of issuing currency without debt , the argument that has been given is basically that it causes inflation . #% That was meant to happen in the Fourth Framework Programme and it did not . #% All political leaders in both governments , but especially those in Northern Ireland itself , bear a heavy responsibility . #% It remains perhaps one of the most intractable problems facing all of us . #% Indeed , in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission which looked at this whole area of junior doctors in training highlighted seven points which need immediate action : the excessive hours of work in some countries ; the question of on-call duties ; unrealistic rostering periods ; protracted periods of continuous duty ; the distribution of duties between junior doctors and senior doctors ; informal pressures on doctors in training ; the vulnerability of breaks and time off in the face of the pressure of service needed . #% The debate and discussions generated by the Green Paper will be incorporated into the Commission 's White Paper for consideration by the Council this year . #% Less money from an EU of 25 than from an EU of 15 is not acceptable and is , frankly , irresponsible . #% Could you let us know exactly how Question Time is going to be organised now ? #% I would appeal to the Irish presidency to put this matter on the agenda of the EU-US summit in June this year . #% I want to join with those who have condemned the allegations of rigging in the recent electoral process . #% Fundamental to the dream of the founding fathers of our Union , 50 years ago , was the imperative to cede national sovereignty in exchange for the greater sovereignty of a united continent . #% So , I would suggest to the Commission and Council that Parliament is offering them an opportunity to improve the balance of the package before them , and I would urge them to accept the proposals being put forward by Parliament . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate Mr Cunha . #% It needs to be made much more effective : we need systematic compilation on the illegal wildlife trade to determine the numbers of seizures and confiscations . #% I do not think that this is a good idea . #% First of all , unlike many other speakers , I am not happy with the decision taken on Monday and , Mr Solana , as a former pacifist turned militarist , I would actually feel that your role within the WEU is a further compromising of neutral states . #% It has been proposed by the umbrella organisation -- an alliance of 115 NGOs and civil organisations in Colombia -- which is seeking to engage the civilian population in finding solutions to the 40 years of conflict . #% - The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People 's Party , which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement . #% We have to do it by , in the first place , seeking to construct a unity in the European Union . #% The case of the young British au pair who was found guilty in the United States of fatally injuring a child in her care has raised other concerns . #% Are we talking about climate change levies , emission taxes , energy taxes generally , carbon tax , carbon dioxide tax ? #% On Amendment 169 relating to alcohol , I support calls for a ban on alcohol advertising until after 9 p.m. , notwithstanding that in Ireland we do have a strong voluntary code in place . #% They announced these measures to increase the availability of products . #% Energy conservation , rational planning and renewable energies are agreed to be the most important way forward other than the CO2 tax , about which , as I have said , no agreement has yet been reached . #% 
We have failed to do that so far . #% Such nominations would risk provoking even deeper crises . #% I welcome the focus on better research in Europe , especially as we know that 85 % of research today is without EU coordination . #% The entire Yangtze valley and its tributaries have been flooded - a region in which 380 million people live , as many people as live in the European Union . #% We must become the heralds of a new world , a world that recognises those fundamental and basic rights of freedom , the right to life , the right to liberty , the right to security . #% In 1999 , 41,000 images were seized and one recent conviction revealed a man with over 50,000 images of child abuse . #% This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union . #% But the amendments relating to the draft Statute and the points of principle of the draft Statute are put onto the annex side and the questions relating to the annex side are put on the draft Statute side . #% Despite what other people may think , some brilliant ideas come from this Parliament . #% I favour a framework directive . #% Originally the plan was for the vessels to pass through Irish waters but at the moment it seems that is not the case . #% Moreover it is not just companies . #% Clearly the current EU and indeed US markets could do with an output boost , but it is the developing countries which would really have benefited from a successful Cancún . #% What we have agreed in Parliament , in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , does not go far enough . #% I am not aware of any pressure from any of the states mentioned in the question for improved dialogue with the Union and I believe that the dialogues which exist are working reasonably satisfactorily . #% They ignore the damage and destruction caused to the beef industry in neighbouring Member States . #% EU bilateral trade relations with third parties are all the more crucial for human rights and social and environmental standards when there is scant prospect of progress within the WTO framework . #% Will it deliver a better form of justice ? #% I am glad that the parties who wanted this in have agreed to take it out , because it would be a really dangerous and very bad signal to send at this time to the military regime in Burma . #% We must desist from getting into the ` nanny state ' frame of mind . #% Football is the only sport where agents are active in all EU Member States . #% It merely serves the interests of the more powerful , and that is not a Europe that we want to see emerge in the future . #% In particular , I would urge that close attention be paid to those areas where resource gaps have been identified . #% The Irish people have spoken . #% We in the ELDR Group believe that the Union 's job at this stage is to develop this new paradigm so that there is a sense of an enabling Europe : enabling our citizens to achieve their full potential . #% Mr President , there are many examples of this Parliament and the institutions responding with urgency to matters of public concern and none more so than in the area of food safety and consumer protection . #% At the very least , all full-time mothers ' work must be credited for contributory pension purposes . #% The report from the Committee of Inquiry incorporates a number of amendments which I tabled because I believe that BSE spread outside Britain mainly through exports of contaminated meat and bonemeal . #% Congratulations again to Mr Linkohr and to Mr Busquin . #% I would therefore make a plea that the maximum effort should be made to simplify the process so that regional products may be protected and promoted more swiftly , and I welcome what the Commissioner had to say in that regard . #% As the managers of the fund themselves acknowledge , the European Union 's contribution represents a major international recognition of the efforts by both the Irish and British Governments to seek a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland conflict . #% Loud and sustained applause #% You may say that this point is not relevant to this debate , but I put it to the House that unless we can ensure the conformity , viability and profitability of the production base of Europe 's food sector , we are unlikely to reach the standards to which we aspire . #% I need an adequate response from the Commission , and so far we have not had it . #% The age of consent varies between countries : 13 years in Spain and the Netherlands , 17 years in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland . #% The proposal from the Commission is not only fundamentally flawed but it is also extremely disappointing . #% We would not need a regulation of this kind if it were not for the fact that every year in Europe over 500 000 passengers are affected by cancellations and the denial of boarding . #% There are so many problems that they feel it is out of their hands . #% Generally , terrorism is found in areas of conflict resolution where unfortunately many of those involved believe in what they are doing . #% While the proposal aims to maximise the economic yield of a fishery , and also maintain the capacity of the stock to produce maximum sustainable returns in the long-term , I fear that , far from reducing the levels of discarded catch , critical flaws in the model may cause over-exploitation , as the underlying assumptions used for calculating levels of catch are based on single-species , shallow-water fisheries and do not take account of geographic and biological diversity . #% However , I want to deal with another issue . #% I hope that you will continue to monitor developments in a pragmatic way . #% However , just as I am guided by my own conscience , I do not presume to pass judgement on how other people will act in relation to their own consciences and in very difficult circumstances . #% So I believe the best way is to make it easier for young farmers to inherit the family farm at an earlier stage , be it through an early retirement scheme or through a bond scheme . #% My own Group , the ELDR , strongly believes in a wider and deeper political Union . #% On the positive side , compared with the old extradition process , the time delay has reduced dramatically . #% If one fish is found dead in a stream , lake or inland waterway anywhere in the European Union , there is war ; someone is taken to court , and people are brought to justice . #% I know the Irish Government is committed to that issue as a government adopting the Irish approach , but I would ask you to put that onto the agenda for the other Member States in Europe and seek to ensure progress is made on it during your six months in office . #% Commissioner Monti 's paper for Verona establishes clearly that tax on the low paid has gone up . #% One point that Mrs Zrihen wanted to make was that the surface area definitions must be re-examined over the next four years . #% The IAEA has confirmed that 75 % of the notifications of incidents involving nuclear material in the last year were illegal activities . #% In the Lisbon review , I urge you to correct any faulty -- or indeed accurate -- interpretations of the strategy that have the unfortunate effect of increasing the gap between rich and poor , able and disabled , strong and weak . #% We abolish national embassies . #% The inclusion of the five-step waste hierarchy plan and the insistence on obliging Member States to provide waste prevention plans are also welcome . #% I am disturbed that the Commissioner shows more concern for trade liberalisation than good farming practice . #% I have a number of questions : What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets ? #% This is the polite euphemism for corruption , and that is what we must control here . #% This debate about decommissioning comes at an opportune time , and in our discussions with the applicant countries in the enlargement process we must press for the decommissioning of plants that are unsafe . #% Mr President , let me start by acknowledging the contribution that my colleague , Mr Moreira Da Silva , has made to the emissions trading directive and all matters relating to Kyoto for so long . #% Finally , I want to draw Members ' attention to one other point . #% It has a knock-on effect in other areas , especially where there are shared coastlines . #% I look forward to working with the Austrian Presidency and finalising this very pragmatic law that will assist businesses and citizens in recovering debts , and to a full plenary debate with the Council and Commission and a vote in the New Year . #% If the existing Member States can not comply with the existing legislation and can not meet their targets then it is going to be very difficult to argue and to push for the new countries coming in to do the same , since they come from an economically less well-off background . #% This treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts , and without it , the prospects for progress in nuclear disarmament are considerably reduced . #% I am grateful to the chairman and the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development for addressing the proposal as a priority once it was received from the Commission . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning . #% 
The hormone issue was decided by the European Union some years ago not on the basis of science but rather on emotion . #% The Commission measures proposed to allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU , and a selection of other animals that are classified as pets as well . #% Mr President , a debate on human rights in the European Union should be an occasion to highlight issues of major importance . #% Another issue raised once again is the easy option : blame the CAP - as if the CAP were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world . #% . Common fisheries policy rules must be implemented effectively and in a uniform way . #% I accept , of course , that rises in prices and labour prices and labour costs can impact on inflation , but clearly in our Member State economies , where increasingly wage rates are negotiated through national agreements and are linked to productivity , and have all kinds of other factors built into any increases that employees get , the likelihood of labour costs being the driving force behind inflation to my mind is untrue . #% We should not , however , accept an increase in parliamentary powers at one level at the expense of our existing powers at another level . #% The unknown quantity in regard to the external value of the euro is clear : it is the speed and extent to which the euro has the market-base capacity to become a reserve currency and what the implications of that would be in feed-back terms for internal policy , which at the moment is conjectural . #% It is now up to the Luxembourg presidency , as leader of the Council , to find a compromise and to find a way forward at the European Council meeting . #% This reference , which was accepted by the Culture and Youth Committee as well as Parliament , referred to the need to examine the role of the family among those factors which have promoted and hampered the social integration of young people . #% There should be no undue influence using European taxpayers ' money to promote propaganda forcing people to vote in favour of the Treaty . #% When the ten new Member States joined in 2004 , we welcomed their membership for various reasons , not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy . #% However , it is my strong belief that it is more important to assess the impact of enlargement on existing European policies and , if necessary , to reform the actual policies rather than concentrate on administrative and institutional reform . #% I think the two more important points , as mentioned by the Commissioner herself in her address , are , firstly , the question of finance : it is vital for any programme that it be properly budgeted for and given the resources to ensure that all can benefit from it . #% When you are illiterate that is impossible . #% I would like to reassure Members that we are doing our very best to take action in this regard . #% The Irish people only recently displayed their commitment to the EU by voting strongly for the Lisbon Treaty . #% These stocks are a major target of the large important artisanal fisheries sector and the fishermen are very worried about the impact this will have on their livelihood and the food supplies of the coastal villages . #% I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue . #% Motor insurance is a multi-billion euro business and further competition must be encouraged so that consumers can reap the benefits . #% We have a moral obligation to ensure not only that the quality of life of present communities is protected , but that the quality of life of future communities is protected also . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for the outline of the situation . #% As rapporteur on the DCECI , I am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year . #% Let us hope that the publication of next month 's annual report will show significant improvement . #% We are dealing with an ideal that we would all love to see : a shorter working week , more money , less taxation , more leisure time . #% It is about the Petten reactor in Holland , which we are always assured is for medical research . #% Mr President , first of all there is a debate over whether the European Union should be discussing things in relation to common standards on procedural law . #% The euro will , hopefully , become a symbol of our interdependence and an incentive to the states of the European Union towards further cooperation . #% Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks . #% My colleague has spoken about the end ; the end is nigh . #% I hope that , at the Council meeting tomorrow , the leaders , the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission will deal with that issue most urgently . #% I also reject any lowering of quality standards for inland waters compared to coastal waters . #% In general I feel this resolution points in the wrong direction . #% Mr President , torture is always wrong and counterproductive . #% In other words new light goods vehicles will now have to respect requirements that are broadly similar to the ones that are already applied to passenger cars . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating not only our own representatives at the Convention but also the Convention as a whole for the tremendous work which it has carried out . #% We should not jump to any rash conclusions about the need for the harmonization of tax in order to create equality of competition . #% The problem with the Gallagher report is that it does not address these points and simply argues the case for regionalisation . #% We are talking equality and not dominance here . #% Madam President , Commissioner Prodi , Commissioner Byrne , the BSE and dioxin crises coupled with the ongoing controversy regarding genetically modified foods have combined to seriously undermine consumer confidence in the safety of food . #% We are also very well aware that good progress in this whole area is being made under the Irish presidency where there is a passionate attachment and a very positive experience of progressing film production . #% I hope the outdated mind-set of the past will not stand in the way of the relief of so many in the future . #% They face a squeeze from banks when it comes to existing credit and the future credit that is necessary to their existence . #% I wish to concentrate on research and development . #% They collapse and people lose jobs and our social security bill increases . #% Now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option . #% The previous speaker is right , jobs may be jeopardized , including jobs in other shipyards if we do not give due reflection to the knock-on implications . #% If you can achieve that then you will go a long way to allaying the consumers ' fears . #% Energy efficiency is one of the few obvious contributions towards the attainment of the targets set for the EU in Kyoto . #% Until that criminal activity is stopped definitively and the iron grip that the Republican movement exercises on various parts of Northern Ireland is ended , there is little possibility that ordinary citizens can hope to have their human rights vindicated . #% This is one area where the European Union can have a practical effect on citizens ' lives by improving living standards and increasing environment opportunities . #% I think that with enlargement we have an opportunity to look again at the whole question of minority languages . #% I note what the Commissioner told us earlier . #% Make no mistake , it is Sinn Fein IRA alone that has once again let the people of Northern Ireland down . #% We have not done enough in that sector . #% Mr President , it is quite clear from the previous speeches that the situation in Zimbabwe is one of clear and total demoralisation amongst the people living there . #% Mr President , I should like to discuss the report from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on behalf of which I drew up an opinion . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report and was very happy that it was passed by the parliament . #% It is my understanding that the EU and the Court of Justice have stated that laws relating to abortion are dealt with at national level only and that the EU has no competence in this area . #% The American decision is deplorable and it sends out a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world as regards nuclear disarmament . #% This morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area . #% It is inevitable that new initiatives will be required to move the action plan forward . #% We had a very difficult debate about this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , and I congratulate the rapporteur on seeking to establish a consensus , which I believe will carry the report with a great majority here . #% But I do not believe they are so concerned . #% However , in phasing out substances , we must also ensure that existing F-gases are not simply released into the environment . #% Is the Council discussing this issue ? #% 
We must give judges and courts in the enlarged EU the option of a range of enforcement tools . #% In the second reading in Parliament , there was no definitive resolution on the crucial vexed issue of the dual legal base of the regulation , which was retained . #% I say on behalf of my group - and this is not the responsibility of a hard-working Portuguese presidency , but a failure of a collective will - that we regret the failure to date to make more progress on some of the basic issues . #% In addition to the fine balance attained , I am very satisfied to see the increased assistance for SMEs , the promotion of alternatives to animal testing , community-wide labelling , and creation of an EU agency to manage the technical , scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system at Community level . #% The mistake that was made in my country , when the associate organisation of ETA declared its ceasefire back in 1994 , was that everyone rushed forward with political rewards for that which had been done . #% Ireland , at the best , was getting 2 % , Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1 % and 2 % of GNP . #% The CFP has become a bureaucratic nightmare with over regulation and micro-management plaguing the industry while achieving little in the way of positive outcomes . #% Is it not possible , out of courtesy to Members , to take questions together when they relate to the same subject ? #% We want to see that promoted . #% Mr President , one wonders what one can say in two minutes on the appointment of a Commission . #% The incumbent president of the European Energy Council , Michael Lowry , must explain the likely effects of the impending liberalization of gas markets in Europe . #% You have also referred at length to energy . #% We can not , however , turn the clock back but through carefully constructed training and educational programmes involving organizations such as CEJA , the European umbrella body for farm organizations and , in my own country , Macra Na Feirme , our young farmers ' organization , we can create the economic and social infrastructure necessary to encourage and help more young people to pursue farming as a credible career . #% My thanks and congratulations to Mr Bourlanges for his painstaking work on behalf of the Members of Parliament . #% Where was the Tony Blair of the Good Friday Agreement , a man of understanding and goodwill , who could bring both sides of an intractable conflict to the table ; a man who showed singular courage on the Iraq question , regardless of our views of the right or wrong . #% Within a generation there will be two billion more people on this earth , 90 % of whom will be born into what is now the developing world . #% The Commissioner and others have said that it is too early yet to draw conclusions . #% There is a world of a difference . #% Politicians can be broadly divided into pragmatists and idealists . #% Introducing genetically modified fish into aquaculture is something that is extremely dangerous and should be avoided . #% I make no case for leniency of treatment at all . #% I also want to wish David Trimble , First Minister , and his Deputy First Minister , Seamus Mallon , their government , the Assembly members and the people of Northern Ireland , peace and prosperity into the next millennium . #% And again I would congratulate the Commission in the past 12 months on the deepening and extension of the information and communications policy . #% The second key question is the issue of interoperability , and the McCarthy amendments in this area are worth supporting . #% I do not think that the EU has taken Alzheimer 's disease seriously . #% We also need to focus on the development of substitute fuels and alternative technologies . #% In today 's Irish Times Wicklow County Council admits to the existence of up to 88 illegal dumps , 19 of which have not even been examined yet . #% In the last programming period 9 % of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives . #% Equally , and for the same reasons of ensuring impartiality , public media operators should be independent and not subject to interference by governmental authorities . #% My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance . #% Parliament is perfectly correct to emphasise the need to make maritime transport safer , better protect the marine environment and enhance shipping security . #% The tobacco industry and tobacco growers have to realize that they will have to turn to alternative crops . #% This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components . #% Europe must stand up to the Bush administration which seems to see us as ` client states ' who will rubber-stamp their every excess . #% I would like to speak on behalf of the non-federalists in our group who actually feel that Europe is centralising far too much and more and more powers are being taken away from people at local and national levels , basically without any proper democratic control . #% Madam President , it is very regrettable that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has voted to allow even higher levels of dioxins than the Commission had proposed , when you consider that dioxins are one of the most toxic substances known to man . #% Commission : take him on . #% We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it , but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out . #% I particularly welcome the addition of mobility allowance in Annex IIa under Heading G ` Ireland ' , that is , new point ( da ) . #% All concerned -- manufacturers , national authorities , consumers -- hold a stake in the process and stand to benefit from the regulation . #% However , be that as it may , the matter of transport in particular impacts very much on the general public . #% To create and sustain jobs , the European Union must become the most competitive economic area in the world and I am delighted to welcome the Council 's decision to establish the Competitiveness Council . #% Regarding enlargement : my group is deeply committed to that process but I would say to the Commission - and I say it also to this House and to Mr Solana - that we really need to focus quality time and attention on Cyprus . #% We have a great duty to help and protect our constituents at this time of great financial turbulence . #% The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are not the only matter up for discussion within the Middle East . #% That is not a satisfactory way of achieving the objectives of the Lisbon process . #% Some would say that the vast majority do , and if that were the case , then we would not need to legislate . #% I thank the Commissioner for her very comprehensive and most informative reply . #% As somebody who comes from an island Member State which exports 90 % of its production , I am deeply concerned at the lack of mandatory authorisation included in this directive . #% The continuing decline in the number engaged in farming and the deteriorating age profile of farmers are social indicators which we ignore at our peril . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single currency , combined with better competition in the marketplace , has resulted in a substantial reduction in interest for those on variable rate mortgages . #% There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight , for instance , between a Nigerian worker on an Irish building site and an Irish worker on a Greek building site . #% Its continued health is an essential prerequisite , not just for the economic health of the Union and the Member States but to their economic viability . #% In order to secure an EU type approval for light commercial vehicles , the Directive will include a requirement that in the future vehicles be tested for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption . #% We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it . #% I have asked our Minister for Justice for an explanation , as I understand the person in question has walked free . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , the DCI , the European Union 's Development Cooperation Instrument , is a powerful tool . #% These new instruments are exciting , but we have to be sure that many people are not prevented from taking part in the programmes because of their lack of familiarity . #% You can not say to the French , the Belgians and the Irish ` no , you must restrict your effort ' , while at the same time effectively say to the Spaniards ` you can increase your effort four-fold . #% The general public throughout the EU are very much opposed to the use of animals for something that is completely unnecessary . #% The Irish Government must act more swiftly to ensure that this aid is granted directly to those who need it , that it is not used to replace government funding , and that the training and re-skilling programmes offered are suited to the workers ' needs . #% This is defined in the legislation as the main place of business of the undertaking , together with its various subsidiary places of business . #% You have a job to do : go out and sell it and give Member States every assistance you can to sell it . #% Normally I do not take much notice of the lobbying information I get in this Parliament , in particular from industry , but I was amazed at ` Cosmetics - your choice , our responsibility ' from the European Cosmetics , Toiletry and Perfume Association . #% There are lots of opportunities here . #% I wish you well and I will be with you right along the way . #% 
Effective coordination requires a reliable and comprehensive store of knowledge on diagnosis and treatment of infectious equine diseases . #% I hope everybody has heard that . #% The financial services action plan must be implemented so that there will be an integrated financial services market in the Union by 2005 . #% We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested . #% If we are serious about the European model based on family farming , then we must ensure that those who operate within that framework are all guaranteed a decent living . #% Too often in the past EU Member States have allowed themselves to be blackmailed by China . #% There has also been a recent departure of a Commission official , Mr Curry , to the board of BNFL . #% Unfortunately I was unable to vote on this occasion due to the hospitalisation of my son . #% And while we have a proposal here that the Commission will report back to us in five years ' time as to whether we are achieving what we set out to achieve , I hope that the Commission will come back here each year and tell us in what direction things are moving - whether the proposals are working , whether things are getting better or indeed in some cases getting worse - so that we can introduce corrective actions , rather than waiting for five years before beginning to take alternative steps . #% In time the United Nations and the European Union should be given positive roles as new political structures develop in Afghanistan . #% I have been sitting here for almost half an hour waiting for my name to be called because I was informed by the services that I had to be present in order for my explanation of vote to be taken as written . #% By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government . #% Finally , under Recital 14 certain conditions with regard to the average working week are not being implemented . #% The final point that I would make is that we must move to a system where there is a flat rate for access to information technology and not allow internal competition to arise which will block the further expansion of this new global system . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for her reply and ask a question arising from it . #% In this case , the EU and Egypt have an association agreement that has been in force since June 2004 . #% I wish to record my absolute abhorrence of the war against Iraq , which is in breach of international law and natural justice . #% We want to see independence for the people of East Timor , which is their democratic right . #% We need to Lisbon-proof REACH , the Services Directive and the Nutritional and Health Claims Regulation . #% We are speaking today about the 70th anniversary of Franco 's coup . #% Compare this to the only super-state in the world today -- the United States -- the federal government of which spends 20 % of GDP , and you can see what a nonsense this accusation is . #% But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it , unlike this request , so it is an inadequate precedent , even if it is a modest step in that direction . #% The issue of taxation is an issue for Member States alone . #% It must also apply for the multiannual financial framework . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports and for the great deal of work they put into preparing them . #% To pick up on something Mr Haarder has already mentioned , our duty and responsibility is to the countries of eastern Europe , not because of the gift that we give them but because of the new enthusiasm and spirit that they can bring into what is becoming a stagnating European Union . #% It is clear that commitments entered into by various parties , instead of being built upon , are in fact being reversed . #% He is still there . #% The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union . #% Stop digging ! #% The Commission itself has said that this could bring about savings of greater impact , of approximately EUR 6 billion per annum . #% in writing . - The global financial and economic crisis has hit the developed world so deeply that we are now struggling with a social and unemployment crisis . #% How can the Presidency commend the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the mission when it was fully aware that we never received a formal invitation from the authorities and that they also refused to sign a memorandum of understanding , including an agreement to provide security cover . #% I am supporting this Conciliation Agreement , which guarantees that the elimination of hazardous substances will now feature in this Directive and addresses this imbalance . #% The Liberal and Green amendment was deliberately sabotaged by people who do not want to see the system changed . #% We know that despite the ideology purveyed by the Tories in the United Kingdom who have lost two elections in a row based on their approach to the economy and the people of the United Kingdom . #% If ever there was an example of bureaucracy at European level , this surely is it . #% We know the problems that the Member States have in their own waters , so it must be very difficult indeed for these other countries to be able to tackle these problems . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this comprehensive report . #% They spent 53 hours at sea in a Force 10 gale in a container surrounded by furniture . #% Mr President , as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I object to Mr Lechner 's attempt to mislead this House on an interim court ruling that has come out of the European Court of Justice on the ban on tobacco advertising , not on health warnings , which is what we voted on yesterday . #% We should draw some lessons from that . #% It can sometimes be quite ludicrous : as a home carer myself , for a short period of time I had someone sent in by the state to give me a few hours ' help a week . #% There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority . #% How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not , as yet , know exactly what they are to be ? #% Mr President , the problem of global warming is one that the European Union can not ignore . #% I have met with and been lobbied by many disability interest groups who asked for consideration of their position . #% He says it will only apply to temporary cross-border provision of services . #% Alzheimer 's disease represents 50 % of these cases . #% I look forward to the Helsinki Council endorsing this vital principle and other elements which will strengthen the EU ' s security and defence role . #% We are talking about the protection of our children , and that must be our overriding interest at all times . #% That Committee must also be mandated to investigate the whole issue of protection of human rights and democratic transparency in the context of the fight against terrorism . #% In reality we know that regulating the e-commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach . #% Absolutely nothing has been done . #% We have to demonstrate that the politics of this Union can solve their problems . #% Amendments from the Legal Affairs Committee before Parliament would take that right and make it subject to unreasonable conditions and I can not support those amendments . #% -- Mr President , recital A of our resolution says that the people of Burma are subject to human rights abuses including forced labour , persecution of dissidents , conscription of child soldiers , rape and pillage by government troops and forced relocation . #% Mr President , Mr Posselt , we have to accept our responsibilities to ensure that the credibility of Parliament is defended in relation to human rights and humanitarian norms . #% The Commission staff should cease empire-building and behave collectively for the good of the Community . #% I would like to see a uniform inspection regime throughout the Community and the harmonisation of penalties for infringements . #% We must have quality control and the size of fish caught must be closely monitored . #% However , I can not emphasize enough , without reiterating all that has been said by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and other speakers , that the consequences of the worldwide increase in temperatures include the raising of sea level , climatic changes and an increased incidence of skin cancer . #% I agree with those who say we should use the electronic system , as it is much quicker . #% You have supported communities and shown faith with ordinary people in the border regions of Ireland . #% In this context I would urge the governments of France , Italy , Spain and Portugal to consider carefully the implications of delaying an agreement . #% Mr President , it is really important that we produce a recommendation for minimum distances from people 's homes for mobile phone masts . #% 
I join my fellow parliamentarians here collectively in sending our condolences to the friends and families of the victims of that crash . #% My colleagues , in my group from Ireland , will not be voting in support of the censure on the Commission . #% What goes for Azerbaijan should certainly go for a Member State of the European Union as well . #% We need to give them the skills and training that they require to work in the so-called digital economy . #% I am bound to say on behalf of my own group that the Liberal Democrats here in this House are unhappy at the pace with which the thought of having a systematic ban on the free movement of labour became the politique acquise . #% I believe it has a statement that it wishes to put on the record , to which I would like to be in a position to reply . #% I know it is difficult and there are differences between the Member States on this , but there is a much wider concern for the future which has to be borne in mind . #% It is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the International Fund for Ireland : this is not a European Union programme . #% I fully condemn the wholesale arrest of political opponents of the General , which include 3 000 peaceful protestors and civilian and human right activists . #% As I address you , it is a great pleasure for all of us to move from the era of Paddy the Irishman to Paddy the President . #% That is an obvious solution : either financial compensation or compensation in some other form . #% Mr President , ` one size fits all ' is one of the curses of EU legislation and , if the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety gets its way , we will have under this directive another classic illustration of it in action . #% Spain is proposing a law to list certain flags-of-convenience countries and we welcome that . #% It is imperative that this level of funding be viewed as an absolute minimum . #% Unless we can control organized crime - international organized crime , particularly - we will find that these policies will become more and more restrictive . #% Today 40-50 % of plasma products used each year by European patients come from plasma donors who are compensated for their time and inconvenience for this lengthy process . #% Fortunately we , as a society , have developed in our attitude towards giving future protection to the elderly , those in need of pensions and the most vulnerable within our society . #% The way in which the Community responds to Alzheimer 's disease will be a further test of this new commitment . #% To some extent , they are still on automatic . #% Therefore the fusion budget is a financial black hole in pursuit of an ever-receding holy grail of fusion energy . #% In more recent times we experienced the problems caused by the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines , the Erika tanker break-up off the French Atlantic coastline and , from an Irish point of view , the continuing problems caused by Sellafield . #% It is estimated that something like 400 000 people in Europe have this condition . #% On that basis , I support a medical and scientific evaluation of the impact of such a law two years after this legislation comes into force . #% This will have particular benefits in my own country for Irish companies that deliver services electronically over the internet to consumers in other Member States . #% As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice , we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades . #% Failure to meet provisional targets -- and my own country , Ireland , is currently 16 % behind the target set -- is very unfortunate . #% Madam President , I should like to begin - as other colleagues have done today - with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland . #% Their case has been before this Parliament 's Committee on Petitions for a year and a half . #% Throughout the summer months we in Ireland have witnessed the direct impact of the importation of cheap Brazilian beef into the market . #% The sixth framework programme will be another tool . #% The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining stationary applications . #% We will have to show the same determination as in the past in order to find constructive answers . #% I suppose , then , what we really should be focusing on is that fascism , communism , imperialism and the totalitarian regimes we have experienced on our continent have a common thread : a lack of respect for human difference and different ideas and an intolerance towards those who want to chart a different path . #% Amazingly enough , for all the issues that they brought up , they saw that the best way of getting a solution was at a European level -- not at a national level -- because they saw there was a bigger picture involved . #% We have a right to answers and the US Government should cooperate with all of us to ensure that clarification on the issues raised is secured and that human rights and human dignity are not swept under the carpet in this fight . #% It is very simplistic . #% ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States . #% One can only imagine the trauma that these captives and their families have gone through and are still experiencing . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work and for the many additions to the Commission 's proposals , particularly on health and disease and sustainable transport . #% Ultimately , however , our fleets must remain competitive in the long term . #% Since its inception , this particular fund has supported more than 3 , 400 individual projects and has helped in the creation of roughly 28 , 000 jobs . #% I certainly want it within my region because that is important . #% I could not agree that there is any need for that . #% The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity . #% Mr President , you will find that it is a very real point of order . #% A lot of people , certainly in my own country , are shocked that some of the money they have paid for buying a house has been used to corrupt the planning laws . #% We hope very much that this conference will raise the issue again and bring to it the urgent attention that is needed . #% We need to see that a fair and democratic procedure takes place in Western Sahara , that people have the right to vote freely . #% I am a little upset and worried about his talk of rapid reaction and the refusal of a political infusion into ECHO . #% The beef regime unwittingly also supports this exodus from sheep production as ewes are counted for extensification payment under this regime but are not paid for , thereby encouraging farmers who have the option to decrease their sheep and increase their cattle on a holding to draw down more extensification payments . '' #% He is a European of the first rank . #% It would be interesting to know what the expenditure of financial services institutions will be on analytics in the EU after the introduction of Basel II . #% Or check whether they have been toasted on both sides at Torremolinos during the previous fortnight when they were on holiday and say ` Sorry , you ca n't go in the sun this week at all ' ? #% The reason is that I am very angry at the statement issued by the Presidency concerning the election and I regret that the same sentiments were expressed today . #% In its review both the social and environment legs of the Lisbon Strategy have been demoted in favour of an EU brand of competitiveness . #% I do not think we can , because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers . #% I welcome the two declarations agreed in Seville , one signed by the Irish Government and the other approved by the European Council . #% Madam President , I would like to confine my remarks to Alzheimer 's disease . #% My group will be supporting its general tenor . #% This has not been the approach nor the view of my group . #% the interlinking of internal policies with terrorism results in the elimination of the inter-pillar structure , bringing forward the logic of the draft EU Constitution . #% Once again , I call on the European Commissioner for the environment , Mrs Wallström , to invoke powers under the Euratom Treaty to force an independent evaluation of the environmental risks to be carried out for the shipment of nuclear materials in the Irish Sea . #% Under this draft recommendation , each plan should define the geographical area which it covers , cover a defined period of time , include specific provisions for its revision , identify the specific sites or types of installations covered , prescribe the programmes for routine environmental inspections , provide for and outline the procedures for non-routine environmental inspections , provide for coordination between the different inspecting authorities . #% Madam President , I originally drafted the opinion on fuels for the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy but now speak for the Socialist Group . #% We bear equal responsibility for maintaining and strengthening our efforts to prevent biodiversity loss and environmental degradation . #% Who is going to take care of us when the time comes - not just financially but also with the love and attention that the elderly need at that stage in their lives . #% 
Secondly , transport workers : when we already have tachograph legislation in place , why do we need to bring in a separate and new directive on transport workers , in particular lorry drivers and so on ? #% It is a criminal offence to own this pornography , and very often the people using it are only pretending they are collecting it for the police . #% Much of the discussion in committee centred around transport of mature animals for slaughter on mainland Europe . #% Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU , although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated , which is done only in the United States . #% In conclusion , I would like the Commission to ban mass medication of the public water supply . #% It is such a fundamental and important issue that I hope we do not abandon the attempt because of this difficulty . #% Many of our assistants are potentially vulnerable to exploitation . #% Immediate concerted action at a European level is needed to reclaim our natural woodlands for the red squirrel before it is too late . #% Ireland has had 30 years of terror , which effectively ended in stalemate . #% We must learn from this experience and ensure that we do not repeat the same mistake . #% Madam President , first of all I want to thank you for chairing this session and also to thank the Commissioner for coming along . #% The Thorp plant has long been a nuclear white elephant for the British people , but the people of Ireland have been totally opposed to it for many years , and will continue to be opposed to it . #% Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives , with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities . #% It is absolutely essential that we enshrine in European law the right to join trade unions and the right to bargain collectively . #% Yet within four days of our preliminary report being published in Islamabad you effectively distanced yourself from our conclusions that it was a seriously flawed process . #% Mr President , I would like to extend a to you , Mr Blair , and to wish to well in your presidency of the European Union . #% However , I am alarmed by the unholy haste in pushing through such a sweeping , power-shifting and undemocratic initiative as the proposed European Constitution . #% The EU was concerned that a food would , for example , be advertised as ` low fat ' which might have lots of sugar or salt in it or conversely as ` low salt ' which was high in something else . #% It would be a victory for the lamentable fearmongering that we constantly hear in this House from Mr Bonde , with his simplistic , opportunistic clichés . #% I am sorry , Mr President , I can not carry on with this disruption . #% I have to say that the Commission 's attitude to the matter has been appalling . #% The responsibility for securing a successful outcome to the second referendum rests with Ireland 's pro-European parties and social partners . #% Regardless of the many other concerns we may have , BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved . #% Enlargement challenges all of us to rediscover Europe 's essential task . #% We need a high-quality European social model which uses social infrastructure as a building block for a prosperous and fair society . #% Mr President , Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare . #% The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult , if not impossible , proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum . #% I therefore support the declaration of ingredients on all food items . #% We could draw up a whole list of the casualties and suffering caused by nuclear discharges , and immediate action should therefore be taken . #% The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards , and I quote directly from what he said , ' I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly , nevertheless they have not been embargoed . ' #% It should look at setting up an EU trust mark or an EU quality assurance scheme to give the consumer the trust and the confidence to use these services which respect consumers ' rights and working rights . #% I do not think that individuals should have the right , just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region , to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances . #% I would also like to say that personally I am very glad that the resolution includes a proscription of the death penalty . #% I also thank the Commissioner for his response to the report and his commitment to renew this programme . #% I commend President Santer on his principled stand on this issue , defending the citizens of Europe . #% Given its importance for improving quality of life and well-being , there is a role for both public and private initiative in innovation . #% If properly financed , LIFE + will give us the means to promote our special areas of conservation and thereby promote biodiversity in Europe , which is being lost at an alarming rate . #% I heard Mr van Hulten 's reference to the fact that OLAF should have the right to investigate Members of Parliament . #% Resistance is still being dealt with by brutal military response . #% In conclusion , from an Irish perspective , I believe that any attempt to reduce the size of the beef herd would be contrary to our national interest . #% These regions have permanent handicaps and we need to recognise this . #% These are demands that can not be met if we want to maintain a viable , sustainable agricultural sector within the European Union for the future . #% They all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets . #% Some progress has been made and we are still a long way from achieving the agreed targets . #% I would caution all interested parties against discussing broader developments within the Union before the ratification process has been comprehensively concluded within the European Union . #% I deeply regret that 430 Members of the House voted against this fundamental policy of the CAP , as I outlined earlier . #% As the drugs market in his area is legal , there is no need for him to go chasing a share of the market illegally . #% Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there . #% A further concern indeed is the liberalization of the electricity and gas networks . #% Nevertheless , the IGC and the new Treaty which will emerge from these negotiations could have an even more significant impact on the lives of our citizens , provided that the Member State governments keep those negotiations firmly focused on tackling issues which are of most concern to the general public . #% That was my wish , but I accept that a charter is a little more realistic . #% The Council , in my view , must now accept Parliament 's amendments to the Ombudsman 's statute on access to documents , as the Ombudsman pointed out . #% Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees . #% I believe there is now too much emphasis placed and too much pressure put on such projects . #% This takes time . #% I regret to say that I believe that is the only language that will be understood and that will lead to a resolution of this particular crisis . #% Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means . #% It is precisely because I agree that I believe this Parliament should use this occasion to signal to the Court of Auditors its intense disquiet at the fact that a document of substance of the sort prepared by the Court should , whether correct or incorrect in terms of its content , have found its way into Der Spiegel of 8 November . #% The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate , embarrassingly inadequate . #% Therefore it must be an issue of great personal satisfaction that , having given so much of your particular attention to institutional matters , you should preside over this last session under the new Treaty of Amsterdam . #% Are you in favour of transparency , or are you in favour of avoiding working in the full glare of publicity , as this answer suggests ? #% This historic event will herald an end to the artificial divide that existed in Europe since the end of World War II . #% We have not taken that issue to hand satisfactorily . #% That is an overstatement of the situation . #% I am deeply concerned at Iran 's lack of cooperation with regard to the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue and that there are no signs of the enforcement of Iran 's commitment within this dialogue to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law . #% It is clear that such individuals visit countries like the Philippines to carry out their vile practice . #% 
In fact , the prospect of a free market in cars was one of the most talked-about issues dangled tantalisingly in front of our citizens as we embarked on the single market in Ireland , in any case . #% Let us make them legal with these rules . #% It is a mistake to move this far , this quickly , without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union . #% It is only right and proper that changes be introduced in a structured and coherent manner . #% I find it very ironic that Ireland has supported this common position . #% Commissioner , you have to recognise that vintage McCreevy does not work at European level . #% Of course , we want a strong Europol in the longer term , and even a better , more cooperating Europol where that is necessary . #% I also welcome the strong support given by EU leaders to Yasser Arafat ' s role as `` Israel ' s negotiating partner both to eradicate terrorism and to work towards peace . '' #% The EU governments must look to the issue of reforming the EU budget , the common agricultural policy and the EU structural funds in a balanced , even-handed manner . #% The other Commissioners would do well to review their own policies and see how they are supporting cohesion . #% The system is due for a shake-up and this regulation will significantly help that process . #% We in the European Union , along with the United Nations , all encouraged the East Timorese to exercise their right to vote in the referendum . #% That is how the plan seems to be evolving . #% I would never dream of going to France , Holland or Germany and telling the voters there what they should be doing . #% Four times more women than men across Europe work part-time . #% I do not understand the political interference and the real message from France , and we should get to the bottom of it . #% I have listed about 20 issues which the Commission should address . #% The possibility of strengthening the justice and home affairs provisions of the Treaty in order to assist in the fight against international crime is also being considered . #% No international observers were permitted at the trial . #% He found common cause with other terrorist organisations throughout the world , including , in my country , the Provisional IRA , which has for years maintained fraternal relationships with its fellow murderers in the PLO . #% We have to recognise that there is a sort of mutual misunderstanding in fishing ports throughout the European Union . #% On the other hand , the United States Government has accepted a request from its textile industry to investigate the sharp increase in the import of textiles from China . #% It provides an example and a message to other countries in the region which have very inferior human rights records and no respect for democratic methods . #% We will , however , need to find a balance between providing sufficient food for the world 's population , while producing this food in a way that does not lead to increased negative impacts on the world 's climate . #% We have , as you say , a single market . #% In part , it has been a victim of the chaotic , undermanaged and sometimes unmanaged growth of responsibilities during the Delors years . #% I am disappointed that there appears to be a dispute between two Commission DGs as to who should fund this programme in the future . #% Madam President , the Belgian Presidency assumed the Presidency of the European Union at an extremely crucial time . #% Let me say very clearly , as I have said many times in the past and will say again at every available opportunity , that the common fisheries policy is not only about fish but also , and most importantly , about fishermen . #% They have put the economy of Georgia under tremendous strain , not just in economic terms but also in human terms , deporting hundreds of thousands of Georgians from Russia back to their home country , denying them access to education and to businesses which they legitimately own and control within Russia . #% What I do ask , Mr President , is whether you , on behalf of the presidency , are in a position consistent with Rule 138 , to make a clear declaration at this time as to what is the position and what is the result of the vote cast . #% If they are not , what action is it taking to penalise them ? #% On the issue of uptake Mr Gallagher is perfectly correct : the uptake is not a reason for trying to slow things down . #% Since then there have been no more exchange rate risks and , in theory , the cost to consumers of transferring money across borders and of changing cash from one euro-zone currency to another should have reduced sharply . #% This initiative will ensure that the Institutions continue to work on the issues closest to their citizens ' hearts , while encouraging cross-border debate on European issues . #% Cameroon is very high in the Corruption Index kept by Transparency International , and in the Republic of Congo , there has been horrific exploitation of some sections of the population , notably the pygmy people , although a new law has just been passed and people will wait to see what this does to protect indigenous people . #% Fishermen must also be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence . #% Despite the respect I have for the rapporteur Mr Méndez de Vigo , today I voted no to his report on the Treaty of Nice ; however , this does not mean a no to Europe . #% However , to get a 48-hour week , junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years . #% I wonder if you have also detected that unwillingness , and which Member States would you say are concerned about the future and which Member States fear that they may be asked to pay for enlargement ? #% Now he wants the European taxpayer to contribute to the arms industry . #% In pursuit of this policy , we have worked constructively with the Hong Kong administration , reflected by the attendance of the former Chief Secretary Anson Chan and her successor , Donald Tsang , at meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% I would like , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , to place a somewhat greater emphasis on the urgency of achieving as early as possible an enlargement towards the east . #% There is a huge gap in consumer knowledge . #% However , I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity -- as we should -- but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union , which also needs protection . #% Mr President , the Commission has claimed that it is entering a new phase with respect to fisheries agreements and that from now on they are to be called ` partnership agreements ' . #% The European Union can not operate effectively unless there is cooperation and understanding between the Commission , Parliament and the Council . #% The Union has come through quite a long period of introspection in economic terms as we have sought to create the required convergence for monetary union . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I also would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Hieronymi , on her work and Commissioner Reding on her work in support of this programme . #% Mr President , today we are debating the difference between reform and destruction , between helping the developing world and enriching the powerful forces in the global sugar market . #% We have shared our Taoiseach with the world . #% These proposals reflect the reporting requirements of the Marrakesh Accords to the Kyoto Protocol , including the use of flexible mechanisms and registries . #% But have we reached a point where we have sidelined men ? #% We must all have respect and tolerance for different opinions , different laws and the right of any state in the EU to legislate and enforce that legislation within its borders . #% We have two pieces of international legislation to deal with this issue : the Luxembourg Convention and the Hague Convention . #% The new President-in-Office , Tony Blair , in his speech to the European Parliament -- and what a marvellous production that was ; obviously the diplomats had got at him , or it , since the summit -- rightly focused on this as a priority and on the illiberal so-called European social model , which protects the privileged and does nothing to create jobs and investment or increase economic growth . #% The people we meet on the streets every day are not afraid of Europe or of the European Union . #% in writing . - I voted no to this report and in doing so , was mindful of a good news story in respect of our marine environment . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Pérez Royo for his report and the efficient conduct of business in committee . #% . The Verts/ALE Group welcomes the fact that the report by Mr Titley on an EU code of conduct on arms exports is a major improvement on his previous reports on this issue . #% The proposals will cost an extra six billion euros and make farmers a lot poorer . #% The ELDR Group is strongly committed to achieving EMU in line with the Treaty criteria and timetable , but there remains space for real policy debate . #% The Argentinian Navy is presently on alert to intercept a British ship carrying enough nuclear waste to give off twice the amount of radiation as the Chernobyl disaster . #% We must do all we can to attract young men and women to the sector in order to ensure its continuity . #% Mr President , I commend the rapporteurs on their reports . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and address myself to the Danesin report also on public-private partnership financing . #% 
However , we have to realise that dialogue must involve both sides of the Atlantic . #% BSE is a disease of older cows , primarily older dairy cows . #% In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today . #% If we can get one job in every SME in Europe , we will end the unemployment crisis . #% I raised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starving . #% I predict that in ten years ' time - say , at the end of the next programme - instead of the seven million farmers we have today , we will probably have four million farmers , and yet we will be spending more money . #% We now have 18 months in which to spend it , and I am calling tonight on our local Minister in Ireland , the Minister for Enterprise Coughlan , to personally intervene and see that there is a plan in place to spend the money . #% We are extremely happy to totally support Mr Whitehead 's excellent report . #% Is that an acceptable way to continue ? #% The fact of matter is this : we live in an internal market where there is free movement of goods , services , persons and capital . #% The Commission is not a clearing house for policies and the Commission must take forward our structural fund programmes ; it must also take forward the territorial and local employment pacts and give direction in this area through concrete actions and coordination activities . #% I am satisfied that everything possible is being done , but nothing can be left to chance . #% I propose a significant boost in aid for trade , which would be aimed at helping developing countries help themselves by enabling them to turn market opportunities into reality . #% I hope that colleagues will support this resolution and vote with us on it . #% While the eradication of poverty is the primary development policy objective of the EU , many policy initiatives undercut this purpose . #% Those regions must be taken into consideration . #% At a more central level , there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors , international NGOs , indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted . #% Additional restrictions on existing LCP are not justified in the context of Member State commitments under the NEC directive to reduce overall emissions and the impending application of the IPPC directive . #% Mr President , I believe that overall the German Presidency was a very positive period . #% Furthermore , I think it is an excellent idea that Member States be encouraged to apply fiscal incentives for passenger cars , in order to encourage the placing on the market of cars and vehicles that meet energy-saving and energy efficiency requirements . #% For certain people in certain sections of society , there is a danger in any country . #% Here I welcome the amendment on orphan waste products . #% The European Parliament has no power or authority to vote itself codecision powers . #% This harmonisation of taxes is directly opposed to the wishes of the Irish people . #% I would ask the Commission to provide an outline of proposals it intends to submit on halting Internet abuse . #% We are never there when it counts . #% Just let me remind the House that no religion - or political movement for that matter - is without its fundamentalists . #% At the very least a ban on cadmium in household batteries would help to reduce cadmium levels and promote the use of alternatives in batteries over time . #% Mr President , on behalf of my political group , I very much welcome the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Burundi and in particular acknowledge the cross-party support for the condemnation of the brutal murder of Archbishop Courtney on 29 December 2003 . #% It is a fundamental right for people to be able to protest throughout the European Union . #% But I would like to ask how you think extradition requests will work when , for instance , material originates in third countries , where perhaps the same kind of basic legislation does not exist ? #% This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it . #% I was very impressed at the beginning of the year to hear from the German Presidency that they would forward the ACP papers to Parliament in the same way as they had forwarded the papers for the Asian and Latin American countries . #% Mr President , for the food sector , food safety and quality must surpass all other considerations . #% Finally , I would appeal to those people who buy black-market cigarettes to remember that they are putting money into the hands of ruthless criminals who are possibly also engaged in laundering money from drugs . #% I hope that you will agree with me , Commissioner , that in the current context that will be a small price to pay . #% I voted against the Brejc report for the very reasons that some of my colleagues have outlined . #% Something has to be done . #% This is a reform which is both necessary and overdue . #% We witnessed it again at last week 's conference of the National People 's Congress in Beijing . #% They did not receive funding from the European Union and they could not receive it unless they were part of EWL , which claimed to be the only voice for women throughout Europe . #% I welcome the commitment and enthusiasm that the Irish presidency has brought to this debate and the personal commitment of the Irish Finance Minister , Mr Quinn . #% In its Agenda 2000 Communication , the Commission retained the priority policy goal of promoting economic and social cohesion . #% Also , in the area of private financing for the health service , there must be a risk equalisation element whereby , if you bring in a private health insurer for the health care system , they must take the same risk as existing insurers or the state , which means covering everyone and all sections of society . #% That is why we argue in favour of a specific instrument for the needs of the developing countries , namely poverty alleviation with true economic cooperation and sustainable development , and not just a default instrument for all countries not covered by any other instrument . #% Following the mid-term review , farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he would be willing to bring forward an initiative at Council level calling on the Commission to put in place a new poverty programme that will utilise the best of the past but to make it a real programme , not just experts exchanging ideas , or meetings taking place in exotic parts of the Union . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for the positive reply to my question . #% These are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable . #% . I abstained in the vote on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport because of the lack of integrity in the overall report . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , the spiralling level of violence in the Middle East blinds us to the fact that it was not so very long ago that , instead of the current feelings of despair , there was optimism and hope that a permanent peace could be achieved . #% Firstly with regard to education and training , whether it is lifelong learning , the upskilling of existing skills or providing new skills to people . #% That perhaps demonstrates that the extent of the crimes was unbelievable to us at the time and that the law was not adequate to deal with them . #% We should not be discussing a sensitive question , such as this beef issue , on the hoof . #% What we are seeking is decreased administrative burdens , a more balanced proposal and fairness for all . #% Is that not the basic economic reality underlying your sums today , Commissioner ? #% There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it . #% I welcome the strong endorsement by the UN this evening of that draft resolution . #% It also means that the US , the UK and the others who supported them are pursuing a shoot-to-kill policy - i.e. we believe or suspect the Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction , therefore we go in , we shoot and kill the people and then afterwards we find out there was no justification for this action . #% I would also like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Mussa , for his work on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy in tackling issues which were not fully addressed in the Commission proposal , in particular training for health professionals , nurses and those involved in specific expert care for the elderly . #% Let us not underestimate the amount of work which must be completed before enlargement becomes a working success . #% Never mind the cynics ! #% But whenever the Commission tries to put these obligations into effect , they are shot down by Parliament and the Council . #% We also regret that there has not yet been a communication on children 's rights from the Commission . #% We are still only paying lip service to the whole area of energy efficiency , which has an enormous contribution to make . #% In particular the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Commission must be hardworking and harmonious , so as to ensure that key elements of our EU legislative requirements are enacted in as an effective a manner as possible . #% 
I suppose the technicalities of this debate will go right over the heads of many farmers . #% Firstly , I would like to say that even though I was here for the Theato report I did not participate for exactly the same reasons as Mr Heaton-Harris . #% In conclusion , I appeal to the Minister , in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council to take his courage in his hands and to actively seek the support of all the other Member States in including children specifically , clearly and as a top priority in the Treaty . #% Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month . #% The Commission 's proposals have been sensible , following the lines of the European Parliament 's temporary committee . #% The gap in employment rates between women and men is narrowing but women are still more likely to be in part-time jobs and/or on fixed-term contracts and , for the most part , to remain stuck in poorly paid posts . #% Mr President , I thank the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , and Commissioner Busquin , who have both helped us to work efficiently , as have the shadow rapporteurs . #% It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed , and has been refused , permission to visit her . #% There is a new and different way forward that can succeed and operate for the betterment of the governments and the European Union as a whole , but most importantly for the betterment of the people . #% In the meantime , around the world , the smaller , inefficient sectors will gradually be snuffed out . #% I noticed that at conciliation the views concerned were unanimous - and that includes views from Ireland , Portugal , Greece and other countries whose waste network and recycling systems are much less developed than in some countries in the EU . #% The realities of agriculture and the low farm incomes in both Europe and the developing world are central to this debate and , lest we also forget , one of the crucial problems - and the Commission identified it in its position paper - is that rising commodity prices and rising food prices do not translate into higher farm incomes . #% We would suggest that this would allow this important subject to be examined in more detail , as , again , the timetable imposed was very short and did not afford Parliament the time it would have wanted on such an important subject . #% Most reputable shopping sites ensure that money is not taken from an account . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mme Gradin . #% The Commission sought to take into consideration all well-founded scientific and experimental evidence in preparing its proposed recommendation . #% Madam President , I hope that the new President will treat all Members equally . #% This is what causes violence and conflict . #% As regards an analysis of the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people , I believe it is essential to include an analysis of the role of the family or lack of family in the young person ' s development . #% I will ensure that it is brought to the attention of the president of Ecofin as a matter of course . #% I am pleased to acknowledge the introduction of an Innovation Alliance between UCD and TCD in Ireland , which is a fine example of investing in researchers at the beginning of their careers . #% First of all we thought we would have a proper resolution and then an oral question ; in fact a great many Members signed an oral question . #% They recognise that the quality of that food has improved over the years and , in spite of the fact that , from time to time we have scares and always will , the consumers of the European Union are relatively happy that we have given them a safe product . #% Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently . #% Having said that , I think it is important to bring a bit of balance into the debate . #% Is it the Court of Justice ? #% This , of course , encompasses the equality of all people , irrespective of gender , race , ethnicity , national origin , age , marital or family status , sexual orientation , disability , socio-economic status or indeed political or religious affiliations . #% Judicial cooperation is important because it complements the workings of the internal market and the single currency , as already stated . #% Indeed , as a Member of the European Parliament who represents the east coast of Ireland , this is an issue which is close to my heart . #% As the Commissioner stated , the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation . #% in writing . - The Youth on The Move ( YoM ) programme represents an opportunity to unleash the potential of young people and enable them to contribute to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU . #% Mr President , organic food production is becoming increasingly important in my constituency in Ireland . #% At a time when the average EU citizen is getting heavier and up to 27 % of European men , 32 % of European women and a staggering one-quarter of Europe 's children are now obese , I warmly welcome the European Union 's initiative in tackling obesity through a very important first step : the addressing of nutrition and health claims on food . #% However , it would be counterproductive to ban these gases in such a way that we simply destroy European companies , while simply moving manufactured products that use F-gases to countries that do not ban them , countries that may even see an EU ban on fluorinated gases as an opportunity to capture the refrigeration and other related markets . #% The European Parliament 's position is based on the mistaken view that it is possible to have a ` one size fits all ' approach to Europe 's railways . #% In the case of other countries it means bigger sugar industries . #% But there also needs to be support for NGOs and Member State governments to raise awareness about the impact and effects of sexual violence , be it domestic , rape or human trafficking for sexual exploitation . #% The report assesses the current developments in the areas of institutional development , the rule of law , human rights , the economy , environment and EU-Hong Kong cooperation . #% We all felt it was a challenge to the legitimacy of the Angolan Government that we were treated in this manner . #% In addition , the legal basis for Community action to combat social exclusion is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference . #% In this area the market has failed , as it so often does , and there has been , until now , a certain lack of public leadership , with a particular bottleneck in the clinical trials aspect of finding new products . #% We should return to that at a later stage . #% It also bioaccumulates , which means that it stays in the body and builds up over time . #% Coercion and coordination are two diametrically opposed political and human theories . #% I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled , and you face the real risk of being brought before the European Court of Justice if you do not provide it . #% I visited the Thai-Burmese border two weeks ago for six days . #% But it is a level playing field , fair is fair , and the nuclear sectors can not be subsidised . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Brinkhorst , Mr Fabra Vallés and Mr Tillich on behalf of my group , and say that I support their reports . #% Terrorism is a huge threat to all of us and to all of our citizens and it is something that has to be fought in the years ahead . #% However , it is now out in the open . #% The cost of disposal of this waste would drain the resources of our local authorities in terms of landfill sites , transport and manpower , and there is also the loss to the economy of the valuable materials which were dumped . #% Is this not what employers want ? #% Further cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is needed to achieve an effective implementation of the control of EU fisheries policy , even if the responsibility for the control is on Member States . #% Furthermore , these points are extremely important because one relates to actions to prevent pollution-related diseases , one to combating pollution-related diseases and , finally , one to the whole issue of allergies . #% We need to review the UN Conventions . #% Madam President , I welcome the opportunity to make a few , but important , points on the Stability and Growth Pact . #% The citizens ' initiative is a valuable tool by which citizens can achieve ambitious results through teamwork - this is the essence of the European project . #% Mr President , I would like to say briefly to Mr Cohn-Bendit that passion is a wonderful thing but if passion is not based on pragmatism and common sense , it is wasted . #% My delegation will vote for this directive . #% Unlike the political minefield that surrounds the reform of the UN Security Council , the UN has shown the capacity to agree on a new structure for dealing with human rights questions . #% As Jim Nicholson stated , the situation is exaggerated in Northern Ireland and the UK because of the strength of sterling and there is a new and very obvious reluctance by young people to embark on agriculture as a career . #% I want to refer specifically to the need for such integrated policy for women in rural society , for until now suitable employment opportunities have been limited , with women having to migrate to urban growth centres to find employment . #% Over 40 % of all the people employed in this sector are graduates with third-level education . #% The supply must be safe but , by definition , a voluntary patient who might have HIV is no safer than a person with no health problems and who is paid . #% Only when real engagement and dialogue takes place with Russia can we guarantee a relationship of equality between the EU and Russia , despite our dependence on Russia for energy , despite Russia 's dependence on us for markets , and despite the interaction that there is in geopolitical terms between eastern Europe and Russia . #% It is about promoting sustainable fishing . #% 
Member States must commit 0.7 % of GNI to aid by 2015 , as promised , rather than decrease that share , which is doubly alarming in times of crisis , as GNI itself diminishes . #% I would like that template to be used throughout the EU as part of the package of nuclear safety and security measures , so that there is a proper procedure and a proper forum to discuss real and perceived fears . #% But if I choose to spend my leisure time taking excess exposure to the sun , then go into the workplace on a Monday , say , and I am working on a construction site , or in the fields , in a vineyard , at a sports venue , beside a swimming pool or wherever , and I am already overexposed through lack of personal responsibility at the weekend , is it my employer 's duty to ensure that I should not have any extra exposure to the sun on the Monday ? #% Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission ' s proposal , in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish , but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy . #% In particular , the trafficking of young women for use in the sex trade is a relic of Europe 's fragmented past and must become an aspect of European history . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome our Taoiseach , Mr Bruton , here and congratulate the Irish presidency , including our civil servants , on the hard work they have put in . #% Serious questions have to be asked about the operation procedures and indeed the training provided by low cost airlines such as Ryanair , Translift and others . #% The objectives of reconciliation and peace , establishing contacts between the two communities and forging links between them have an impeccable record in the fund . #% There is a huge lack of medical supplies and there are , I will agree , structural problems over and above the recent disasters of the tidal wave , etc. . #% The use of mobile phones in cars must be legislated for at a European level in the interests of better road safety . #% This has been very short-sighted , as I am sure the Commissioner will agree . #% Obviously the whole area of new technologies is one that has presented us with many problems as well as boundless opportunities . #% We can not continue to maltreat - indeed , crucify - people who have held to the political process , who have tried to maintain peace at all costs , political activity at all costs and to hold violence at bay . #% He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House , as well as to the concern of consumers . #% The European Union should now become party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , a legal step made possible by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty . #% While countering terrorism and fundamentalism is essential , we must at the same time safeguard basic human and civil freedoms . #% It is an affront to and an assault upon both . #% Likewise , under the consumer credit directive , the provider of the service is required to inform the consumer of certain rights , certain entitlements , certain get-out clauses as well . #% At the request of the European Parliament , collector 's vehicles will now be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive . #% Firstly , the plan is : dump the common agricultural policy . #% That is my understanding : there will be a resolution , but not immediately . #% For the purpose of agreement and the speedy implementation of this regulation and hopefully to avoid a lengthy conciliation process , the use of common OIE criteria would be appropriate . #% We can not seriously undertake a programme on energy efficiency with the budget which they scornfully suggest as being appropriate . #% To do otherwise in my view would be to politicise unnecessarily what is now a priority EU agenda and indeed would do nothing to restore consumer and farmer confidence . #% An indication of the potential of genetic research to make a positive contribution to food production is demonstrated by the very recent announcement by Monsanto of a significant breakthrough on the genetic structure of rice , which is the staple food on which millions in the developing world depend and about which there is considerable concern with regard to the continuity of supply . #% Madam President , I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy , which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some . #% I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief . #% Cooperatives and credit unions were also mentioned . #% If dialogue is to succeed , both sides must be open . #% We are also breaking new ground . #% There has to be a better way of controlling it . #% Recently the German Government has been doing U-turns and going through all sorts of contortions in relation to the whole nuclear issue . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Tillich for his report and congratulate him on trying so hard to represent almost everybody 's point of view . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her diligent work on the budget for 2011 . #% It is clear that a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is essential to the peace and stability of the entire region . #% I would challenge him to back up his statement in this House tonight that there is already adequate protection for Irish workers in this area . #% Surveys carried out within the EU have shown that banks are confident that all ATM machines will have all the necessary stock of the new euro currency notes . #% This legislation rolls out the proposal made by Airbus at an Airbus-hosted meeting in Toulouse on 29 and 30 September and 1 October 1997 , effectively commercially sponsored legislation . #% Mr President , I welcome the rapporteur 's emphasis on sustainable forest industries which are indeed of primary importance to the European Union . #% The future is bright , and the single European currency will bring with it an increased number of tourists , which will mean an increased number of jobs in Irish tourism and a healthy industry into the next century . #% You congratulated me on my own initiative , Commissioner , but I would like to say that it was very much at the initiative of the Committee on Petitions that this report was drawn up . #% According to Kurlansky , the Encyclopaedia of Commerce and Navigation printed in New York in 1858 said that the codfish was a species so well-known that there was no need to explain anything about it , that it was extraordinarily prolific and that someone had counted the eggs of a middling-sized codfish and found that there were 9 835 000 eggs . #% That is not serving the interests of the British nation in my view and therefore I will oppose that report . #% Therefore Chernobyl 's problems are our problems , too . #% The operation of this sector can be carefully monitored through appropriate national legislation . #% Mr President , I invite you to ask the presidency to contact the Member who made the allegations and who has been quoted - Mrs Patricia McKenna , of the Green Group - and to ask her to substantiate these allegations or have the decency to withdraw them . #% In relation to price inflation , which is one of the issues addressed in the Council ' s recommendation to Ireland , it is important that we are clear on the following key statistics : the latest figures show that inflation as measured by the harmonised European index has fallen from 6 % last November to 3.9 % this year . #% That is not in any way to undermine or to ignore the suffering people have gone through . #% Reform must take place in such a way that it ensures that the interests of all Member States are taken into account in a balanced manner and above all else , that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully respected . #% Indeed , I do not know about elsewhere , but in Ireland , the only financial institution left standing that did not require taxpayers ' money to sustain it was the credit union movement , which is a not-for-profit institution run by its members . #% If you are sincere in what you are saying in advocating for the rest of Europe a knowledge-based economy , perhaps you could start by ensuring that our Irish universities and third-level institutions are adequately funded to allow access to the greatest possible number of young people . #% I am glad that we are having this debate today if only to raise this issue again . #% We would like to especially thank the EU for its quiet and unintrusive role in Northern Ireland , the framework of the European Union which helped Irish and British Ministers to work together the common agricultural policy , the common policies that created the single market where the people North and South cooperate together now without any border to prevent them from growing together and cooperating and trading together . #% Together with the SAVE Programme , we have in ALTENER II a way of showing the public of Europe that there are rational ways to meet the challenge of climate change : energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy . #% Another very important matter is that Mr Bush , the President of the United States , will be in Göteborg later this week to meet EU leaders . #% We need to be realistic in order to meet the objective of advancing these projects , particularly when the number of priority projects has increased from 14 to 30 . #% in writing . - I support this proposal on cross-border healthcare . #% Apart from the political will not being there , the police will is not there either . #% Madam President , I want to say some words about Martin O'Hagan , the journalist murdered in Northern Ireland a couple of days ago . #% As legislators , we have overregulated their lives and reduced their natural inclination to become entrepreneurs . #% It is pro-citizen and it is pro-consumer and I would strongly urge the Commissioner to consider this proposal favourably , particularly in view of the fact that it is so pro-consumer and pro-citizen . #% I know from the excellent work done by the South Midlands Renewable Energy Centre , the only one in the United Kingdom , that if we go out with the message that renewable energy helps the environment and helps jobs , we get public support . #% There are four main reasons for this and most of them have already been mentioned . #% With the combined efforts of the Community and the Member States which have primary responsibility for energy policy , I believe that these targets can be attained . #% Given the fact that there have been over twenty deaths and almost one thousand recorded cases of the disease in Hong Kong , it is appropriate that the report should refer to this problem . #% Nevertheless , an ambitious timetable has been set for reaching major agreements on the reform of the common agricultural policy , the regional and social funds and the budget . #% 
I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% I would also urge more tolerance in relation to religious freedom . #% I would have hoped that there would be global recognition at this stage that the CCCTB proposal is badly thought out and ill-advised . #% It is also important to recognise that Gama is currently in the process of seeking to dismiss the workers who blew the whistle on this scam . #% Why should we over-fish and , at the same time , import a product which creates a price that is unacceptable ? #% The islands off the coast of Ireland have played and continue to play an important role in preserving the Irish culture and economy . #% Some of the factors involved in competitiveness include - as Mrs Plooij has identified - the single market and coordination and compatibility between Member States . #% I see this particular proposal as upholding the principles of the single market , and I am convinced that it will lead to cheaper cars for EU citizens . #% We all recognise that this is an ambitious timeframe , but it is one that can be met . #% I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress . #% Let us all remember , as was said by previous speakers , that the alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy . #% This is on a local pilgrimage path . #% Those are my points . #% The European Union , in line with the commitment entered into in the Amsterdam Treaty , must become an area of freedom , security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety . #% I am somewhat disappointed by one of the comments in the report stating that common rules of evidence must be established . #% That is demonstrably false . #% The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the burka and have no rights whatsoever , for instance to education or primary healthcare . #% I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process . #% As you know , Commissioner , the concept of fairness differs between Member States , depending on their different legal systems . #% In essence , what the report proposes is improved quality of life for all , at all stages of life , and a recognition that policy decisions and legislation enacted should contribute to that core objective . #% Finally , although it is not in the report , if we are ultimately to have a European driver 's licence , we should look at a different model from the one-test-for-a-lifetime model that we have in Europe . #% I refer in particular to the Erasmus programme which dealt mainly with third-level student exchanges . #% It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this . #% While we were eventually able to implement a mixture of market management and income support measures , such as intervention in the milk fund and export refunds , which eased the pain to a degree , many dairy farmers ended up going out of business and many are suffering serious financial loss . #% Social Europe means nothing if it means putting people in traditional crafts out of work . #% In my own country , for example , the lower tax rate has meant a multiplication of the tax take . #% However , European Union measures adopted in this sphere shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures on this subject . #% There can be no peace without justice . #% They have sent a signal to Berlin that these areas and communities are not a political priority for them . #% Two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments I heard earlier on . #% Many years ago somebody asked me what I thought were the five most important environmental issues of our time . #% One major problem is the possibility that landfill sites which have closed at the time of transposition of this directive will be excluded from the remit of the legislation . #% Madam President , today we commemorate the 25th anniversary of a horrific event in which 13 people were killed at a civil rights march in Derry in Northern Ireland . #% As regards the antibiotic issue where nisin is going to be allowed into egg products , this is completely unacceptable . #% I had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in Thailand that are overflowing with people who have fled from Burma 's Karen province and Karenni province . #% Cohesion is the overriding objective in our Treaty , it stands over and above EMU and that is why we believe that EMU and its processes and stages need to be scrutinized to see how they contribute to cohesion policy . #% The Committee on Industry covers 120 budget lines - so you can see our task is fairly complex ! #% As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity . #% Now , Mr President , I hope you will allow an English-speaker to talk to you in French to suggest that the language of Molière might be enriched by a new and typically European concept , that of ` berthelisme ' , which means having a fictitious job paid for out of European taxpayers ' money . #% It is essential that the remaining legislative and practical steps be completed rapidly . #% Let us not forget that the Growth Pact itself can not be seen in isolation : it must also be seen in coordination with the broad economic policy guidelines that are laid down . #% It is completely unacceptable . #% It is very hard to understand why we do not have better cooperation from all the Member States . #% The outgoing Commission resigned last March and since I can hardly explain to myself why the rump part of that Commission is still there , how can we expect the citizens of Europe to understand that fact ? #% Mr President , I very much welcome the establishment of courts to try the suspects of the former Communist Khmer Rouge regime . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteurs for their work , in spite of the criticism . #% Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries . #% Has the Court of Auditors any recommendations to make to the European Parliament concerning the procedures to be followed in awarding any future contracts , taking into account the experience over the last few years on this particular building ? #% Again , it shows the willingness of the Community to honour its commitments to the poorer regions . #% I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today , in the clearest terms , to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union . #% The system should be changed . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality , which identifies key steps required for the European Union to meet strategic objectives on equality between women and men . #% So for all of the reasons , it is very obvious that this EURES programme has enormous potential . #% Will excise duties vary for on-board sales as ferries and planes cross between territorial waters ? #% We would like to see it extended to all categories , not just to some . #% This Parliament and the institutions have to send a very strong message to the Burmese authorities that international bodies must immediately have access to her . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner what level of discussions he has had with Member States of the eurozone in relation to their performance and their potential performance . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a piece of very good work . #% Mr President , on this point I do not mind what we do . #% In this House we have prioritised consumer protection , established the family farm as the agricultural model and the basic unit of production , and made rural development and the preservation of rural communities the second pillar of CAP reform . #% The EU is falling sharply behind in meeting its legally binding undertakings on reducing greenhouse gases . #% In relation to the proposal mentioned by several speakers , this UK - , US - and Spanish-backed proposal for a UN resolution would put the administration of Iraq , including decisions on its oil reserves , into the hands of the invaders and occupying forces . #% Environmental Projects in Ireland which could benefit under the seven - year programme include waste prevention , waste reduction and recycling initiatives , development of innovative technologies with positive environmental benefits , local and regional environmental awareness campaigns and the development of special conservation areas . #% However , the brutal violence of the last fortnight , and indeed over the last 33 months of the intifada , has deepened animosities and intensified emotional hatreds . #% You certainly played your part , following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr Hänsch in ensuring that we could , at this particular time , be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could withstand the criticisms and cynicisms that were going to be directed at us . #% I understand that blood transfusion stocks are now almost non-existent . #% 
The great prize which it offers is political and security stability across the wider continent . #% Mr President , ever since the Tampere Summit of European Union leaders in 1999 , the issue of formulating common policies in Europe to tackle illegal immigration has been high on the agenda of our institutions . #% I do not agree with all of it , of course , but nevertheless it was agreed by a majority . #% Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy . #% It is expected that this will reduce the FOC tuna longline fleet by about half . #% Worse still , it allowed contaminated meat and bonemeal to be exported without restriction , thus contaminating herds in neighbouring EU countries . #% It is important that proper and sufficient funding for compensation is made available for fishermen to convert to more selective and appropriate fishing gear . #% An internal coordinated approach has to begin in 1997 . #% Time does not permit me to elaborate on the many aspects of SMEs which require our urgent attention , other than to say that SMEs should now receive greater priority in national and EU programmes for job creation . #% First of all , I assume the solidarity fund is a general fund . #% On the outstanding areas of disagreement on the stability pact , what constitutes temporary and exceptional circumstances and the automaticity of fines for errant States , the ELDR supports the room for manoeuvre and judgment indicated by the Commission 's proposal . #% I should also like to add my thanks to the Commission , to the Commissioners present , and all the others who have worked so hard during the period I have been in this Parliament . #% Mr President , clean and safe bathing water is an obvious necessity , and an essential aid to a prosperous tourist industry . #% The factual situation is that China is proposing that peaceful nuclear explosions should be reconsidered at a review conference ten years after the Test Ban Treaty enters into force and that review should be automatic unless a majority of parties vote against it . #% It is in families that children learn the values of ` peace , dignity , tolerance , freedom , equality and solidarity ' ( preamble ) , as well as the skills necessary to implement these values in society throughout their lives . #% For many years these people have moved freely in Bosnia , despite the presence of SFOR troops and have remained free , despite the serious allegations made against them . #% We need emergency fostering in Romania and we need the European Union to push for that . #% We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation , by causing significant imbalance in the parties ' rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer . #% Wealth , growth , enterprise and development need not , and do not , consume the environments of mature societies . #% Low-cost air travel is supported by the citizens of Europe . #% Mr President , last Friday Northern Ireland suffered the double blow of the loss of two factories , both the result of an inability to compete with cheap imports . #% There is one point I would ask the Commission President-designate to respond to . #% The commissioning of the MOX plant when the eyes of the international media were firmly focused elsewhere in the wake of the tragedy of September 11 , 2001 is but the latest example , and is particularly serious , given the heightened concerns now of terrorist attacks . #% One is the detail of what is proposed and the other is the timing . #% We can not stop technology , but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy , parasites and mass illegal copying . #% I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere , in the United States for example . #% I have one child , as do many people in this Chamber . #% That means , as policymakers and institutions , we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain . #% So there is a great need for urgency . #% My analogy with particular types of political movements was an attempt to reinforce my argument that this Parliament and this House in particular must abide by the balance of powers and the different competencies attributed to the different institutions in the European Union . #% It is high time that the EU took a moral stand on the situation in Burma . #% We have to do everything we can to try and stop the forced labour and the human rights abuses . #% The euro notes and coins will not physically be in consumers ' pockets until the year 2002 . #% The Commission 's lack of activity since 1989 in respect of BSE must rank as one of the greatest failures of public administration in recent history . #% Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to colleague Hatzidakis for a very fine report to Parliament here this afternoon . #% A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts . #% I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling . #% Madam President , I would also like to thank the Conciliation Committee for its constructive work . #% I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism . #% Similarly , with other species of white fish , the overall figure was 58.8 % of the total allowable catch of Irish fishermen destroyed by seals one way or another . #% We can now look forward to future reviews of legislation and the work of the contact committee to ensure that there is no violation or abuse of copyright on the Internet or any limitation on genuine private use or fair use . #% It is against this background that the two directives must be reviewed . #% In doing that , let us build a world for the new century and the new millennium in which there will no longer be any war or any conflict but total respect for diversity . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% The conclusion of that survey clearly demonstrated that costs for consumers of transferring money from one country to another in Europe are still too high . #% We should not forget that over the last 50 years we have worked together to fashion an international legal order covering not just trade and security issues , but also issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% Mr President , the election of Mr Adami as the new Prime Minister of Malta is going to have the effect of reactivating the application of Malta to join the European Union . #% It is not good enough for us to wring our hands and declare we are sorry . #% I am amazed that so many people are arguing that by being lax with monetary policy we can help to create jobs or improve the economic environment . #% These waters must be protected . #% He mentioned the need for the statute . #% Never again will the future of Europe be decided behind closed doors , provided we do our work constructively in the Convention . #% It matters to me . #% Finally , the motion demands open access to all territories in Western Sahara for independent observers , NGOs and the free media . #% If there is a precious and scarce resource , why do we exploit it and give it away at prices that are far below its real value ? #% I thank you for your reply , Commissioner , but can you tell me how one is meant to have confidence in the single market if Equitable Life can get away with treating ordinary people in this way ? #% One of the lessons from SAVE I was that far and away the best thing to do is to bring in binding legislation which Member States have to enforce . #% The finance ministers have merely been asked to draw up another report on ways of adjusting the tax system . #% That is a terrible side to it which we do not refer to here . #% These people are taken into prison without proper documentation or proper charges being made . #% Enlargement on 1 May 2004 will strengthen our voice and position on the international stage in favour of Kyoto . #% It was cowardly also . #% Yesterday 's announcement of over EUR 420 million in European Union humanitarian aid for Haiti shows leadership and commitment , but its delivery must be coordinated and effective . #% That is why the debate has been so robust and why all groups have had Members working on this directive almost full time in recent months . #% This is an area that is going to have to be given the closest attention . #% I listened with care to the Commissioner when she gave her reasons as to why she has not brought forward a draft directive under Article 13 of the EC Treaty . #% 
And finally , President , I would say that with regard to the role of the Council of Ministers , we know that they meet in private . #% It will not be retirement for him , but a new phase in his life . #% As Members of this Parliament , it can give us some satisfaction that we can make a contribution to alleviating some of the more immediate effects of redundancy for these workers , indeed giving them some hope for the future . #% I look forward to hearing the Commissioner 's declaration , which is a declaration that I made clear was essential if we were to find agreement . #% We have the technology , the know-how and the resources to ensure that these things do not happen . #% The Irish people have not been allowed an adequate debate on the impact of the changes proposed in the Treaty of Nice upon Ireland ' s sovereignty and Independence . #% Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element . #% I finally accept that , for example , in relation to oil-soluble vitamins there is a case to be made in terms of safety . #% Likewise , planning policies must help , not impede , progress . #% The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people . #% However , this problem must be examined at European level in line with the directive on dangerous substances in water and under the EU water framework directive launched in October 2000 . #% Mr President , I would like to read a section from the April 2001 report of the Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries . #% Amendment 14 also mentions women living in poverty in rural or remote communities . #% Such movements in border areas between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland must be stamped out and licenses withdrawn from those found to be involved in such practices . #% I believe it is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey . #% On the Irish Box , it makes no sense whatsoever in an important nursery and spawning area to try and increase the number of vessels that are going in there , to open up the Irish Box . #% Indeed , Commissioner Prodi was actually a steering committee member in the eighties at the same time as Wim Duisenberg was the treasurer of Bilderberg . #% He made the very concrete statement that the child can not be dealt with in isolation but in the context of the family and community . #% Human rights lawyers have been assassinated as well by loyalist paramilitaries . #% The Spanish Government is also going to set up the Convention in March this year to look at the development of the future of EU policies within the Union in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 . #% This is the real threat to us all . #% I would like to thank the British Government for rejoining Europe because we badly need them in Europe . #% This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice . #% The tribunals in which those guilty of atrocities in the Balkans are currently on trial send one clear message . #% We now have the ludicrous requirement that a DIY retailer , for example , who buys in packaged goods and sells them on , is required to make returns detailing the net weight of the packaging of all such goods passing through his business , even though he never opens or discards any of the packaging . #% I do not support the cloning of human beings . #% These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe . #% But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel . #% If not , it will come up tomorrow before the vote . #% Proposals and recommendations in response to the Green Paper on fisheries policy were produced by the Irish national strategy review group on the common fisheries policy , which was set up by the marine minister and included stakeholders . #% I think the poor rural masses and the urban working class in Thailand urgently need their own independent organisation to fight for their rights , and I hope that the next mobilisation in Thailand might be a united struggle of workers , poor farmers , students and youth , dedicated to overthrowing all corrupt elites and bringing the major wealth of Thailand into public ownership and democratic control and , in a socialist Thailand , transforming the lives of its people and also fighting for the rights of all minorities . #% Women , despite the fact that they make up over 50 % of the population , are still discriminated against . #% If we allow human cloning to proceed under the guise of therapeutic cloning , we risk abuses which I fear would result in the production of a handicapped or impaired child . #% I believe in the principle of equality between small and large Member States . #% They will prevent the remuneration of donors in any circumstances and preclude importation of plasma and plasma products from paid donors . #% To imagine you can force this European political identity on people by adopting some sort of system like this is ludicrous . #% Recent reports concerning the future of CAP are certainly worrying . #% We will look at a cost/benefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal . #% Fifty years ago or more there was no limit and we know what the results were of allowing scientists to discover anything they wanted to . #% This is as true for the coastal community of the Algarve in Portugal , which we visited a few weeks ago , as it is for traditional fishing communities on the island of Ireland . #% In the time that remains to me I should like to turn to Mr Verheugen and to the Council . #% Therefore we have voted to ask that in adopting future selection criteria , in the case of the UK the Commission should take into account industrial change , GDP and the relationship between falling unemployment rates and non-sustainable employment in low-paid , part-time sectors . #% I am not speaking here just of religion but also of politics . #% The Union has made a judgment in relation to the customs union for example which this House has ratified and endorsed . #% It is extremely important that a precautionary approach is taken here . #% Job losses are mounting in the airline industry . #% We must be mindful , however , that the aim of this legislation is also to improve the competitiveness of the chemical industry , one that is very important in my own country and creates quite a number of jobs directly and indirectly . #% It is essential that there should be a strong focus on young generations in the CAP post 2013 so to provide for the development of agriculture in an innovative and efficient way . #% We have to be very careful about telling people with disabilities what they need and what we can do for them . #% I will confine my remarks to the Dublin Foundation . #% I want the people of this House to know that every major newspaper supported a ` yes ' for eastern Europe . #% Mr President , we welcome the fact that the report recognises and accepts that Echelon exists . #% As such , it is imperative that this issue is addressed on a European level . #% Finally , I want to acknowledge the role of Parliament in approving the fund for Dell workers . #% Our message to them today , in this fight for democracy and against terrorism , is that our only choice is to stand united ; for united we stand but divided we shall fall . #% Mr President , I would like to make explanations of vote on two reports combined : on the Cappato and Cederschiöld reports . #% Here again , the capacity of smaller Member States to act as honest brokers , mediating between larger states , was well illustrated and underlined by the Irish presidency with the assistance , as has been acknowledged here today , of the Luxembourg Prime Minister . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Redondo for her report and for her excellent explanation of what all this is about and why it is important . #% The proposed slaughter premium , while it is a contentious issue , is not a good replacement system . #% I would like to focus on the Hernández Mollar report . #% The aftermath of the BSE crisis and the ban on the use of meat and bonemeal has left a serious , sharp fall of proteins in animal feed and must be filled by other means . #% I also call on the Commission to support Commissioner Byrne as he strives to be pro-active in public healthcare by ensuring that patient care and the health and training of non-consultant hospital doctors is protected . #% Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work . #% You said , first of all , that you should not get involved in telling people what you will do if the Irish people vote against and that , if there was an alternative , the Irish people would want to know what that alternative was . #% While I recognise that there were problems with China and Russia , I can not help but feel cynical when I compare and contrast the UN response in Kosovo with its response during the Gulf War . #% As Mr Davies just pointed out , it is trying to flatter our vanity suggesting we really need to continue testing on animals so that we remain clean , so that we can actually correct body odours ; in other words , that we can improve on nature and change our appearance . #% 
The European Union can not add insult to that injury by saying that it is not its responsibility that they have a serious problem in the area of foot-and-mouth . #% I believe , in a certain way , the Summit has captured that . #% There should be a ban on them . #% The three amendments which I have tabled are consistent with the points I have just raised and they are also consistent with the traditional approach of this Parliament . #% As employment in the processing sector continues to increase , this welcome development contrasts sharply with the serious decline in family farming and the reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career . #% Words alone may contribute little to the resolution of this conflict . #% I firmly believe that our young people need to be protected from the scourge of smoking . #% I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament . #% As well as that , with the introduction of the single currency next year and the changeover in financial markets and other similar situations , there is a great fear , and a danger , amongst Member States , private individuals and institutions , that not enough work has been undertaken . #% That is why I welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council , our Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , is holding an extensive round of bilateral negotiations with European Union leaders at this particular time . #% I note with interest that in the final text of the Declaration issued by EU Heads of State , they say `` The European Union is a success story but 50 years on , however , the Union stands at a crossroads , a defining moment in its existence '' . #% What we want to see now is a complete arms embargo on Indonesia and also an economic embargo . #% Maybe they should train the police in places like Genoa and show them how to react to peaceful protests . #% The whole issue of ECHO should be looked at seriously . #% The conference should make clear that it rejects all attempts to undermine the competitive advantage enjoyed by developing countries in the matter of wage rates . #% The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable , with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources . #% It is also vitally important that Member States should allow access for Community inspectors to their waters , allowing for a complete and more effective cooperation between national and European authorities . #% The intention was to amend the rules that currently require all feed materials in a compound feedingstuff to be indicated with a declaration of percentage by weight . #% Issues that we have addressed together range from improving security in airlines to the issue of mutual extradition agreements . #% Therefore , the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to analyse the lessons learnt with the DCI and to define our expectations for the future instrument . #% The whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual Members and also in Member States . #% The Commissioner also said that he had negotiated alongside Commissioner Fischer Boel in Geneva last week . #% Terrorism is wrong wherever it occurs . #% On 30 March 1998 , the Council of Ministers adopted Regulation 850/98 for the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles . #% In Europe today , we have been able to overcome those differences ; we have found a forum and a way forward in which people from different countries , with different ideologies , different histories and different interpretations of the same history can come together and find common ground and a common cause . #% . I congratulate the rapporteurs , Ms Pack and Ms Prets , for their thorough work on the important issues of European policy in the areas of youth , education and training . #% This is a very worrying trend . #% These were the main concerns expressed . #% The manufacturers will increase the price of their cars , so our consumers may not benefit from the abolition of VRT . . #% Madam President , many Irish priests have gone to work in the Philippines and have distinguished themselves in their fight for human rights and for bettering the lot of the people there . #% I believe the necessary funding can be found elsewhere , perhaps from savings and some delay in payments . #% I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement . #% I should like to caution and warn EU ministers in Göteborg to consider carefully the effect that a second resounding defeat would have for the Nice proposals . #% The reform of the pensions systems in Europe has also been prioritised . #% For example , the Commission reprimanded the Irish Government a few years ago about the economic governance of our country , at a time when our economy was growing at 10 % per annum . #% Mr President , let me begin by endorsing much of what Mr Farage had to say in his pertinent observations about the state of trade policy . #% Can you tell us that the desired effect has been achieved , as far as the scientists are concerned ? #% I refer , for example , to the Commission 's programme for rural development or accompanying measures under the common agricultural policy . #% I have carefully read the Court of Auditors ' report on the accounts for that year , particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds . #% This resulted in hundreds of veterinary medicine products being removed from the market and huge welfare problems in Europe for minor animal species - including horses - for many years . #% Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice . #% Since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries . #% This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold . #% This is because the contract limit is too small and the economic reality underlying this is that to move your operation into another Member State requires extra money and a more valuable contract to make such a move profitable . #% We must foster trust , patience , fidelity and love . #% Archbishop Courtney was heavily involved in the peace process and played a significant role in bringing about this recent progress . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , we are all aware of the importance of bees in pollination . #% Balance is required however when voting on a certain number of amendments which would impose a large and disproportionate number of unwarranted burdens on aggregate industry benefiting the environment or society . #% Perhaps without Israel 's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU , short of suspending the agreement , is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports . #% Clearly the way forward for an energy market such as the Irish one is through interconnection . #% Even for the centre right it makes sense . #% Following pressure from Ireland and France , the Commission provided a declaration in the Minutes of the General Affairs Council to the effect that it would submit the proposals on market access to the Council , would remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are exposed to international competition , and would take particular account of sensitive products . #% On many occasions we wait here and you do not get to our questions . #% We must close loopholes on the end-use of weapons ; on where they actually go and how are they used . #% It has a duty to increase the safety of citizens facing dangers posed by the concentration of hazardous substances in the atmosphere , particularly in urban areas . #% We have in the European Union Mr Mobutu , so-called President Mobutu , who is being given refuge in his palace in the south of France . #% The European Union is about to introduce a reform of the sugar regime , which will have serious implications for European farmers and sugar workers if it goes ahead as planned . #% I would say to my colleagues from the Black Sea region : learn from the mistakes of the CFP , examine the consequences the present regime has had on the small-scale fisheries of the north-east Atlantic and ask is this what we want for the Black Sea ? #% The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2 , any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory . #% The presidency needs to produce some sort of strategy to bring an end to the existence within the European Union of parallel data protection systems and the proliferation of monitoring authorities - for example Schengen , Europol or customs conventions . #% If that happens , it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end . #% No matter what happens at the UN climate conference in less than two weeks in Copenhagen , extreme weather conditions , like the flooding in Ireland , will become more frequent . #% We now have a majority . #% There is a lot of discussion at the moment in Parliament and beyond about farmers receiving a fair and stable income for what they produce . #% We should seek to address the relationship between the European Union and the USA by taking a careful and measured approach , rather than dealing with this very important relationship in a knee-jerk fashion . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Katiforis and Commissioner Solbes , both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy . #% 
This is clearly not the case . #% Therefore , for their sake , throughout the Community -- not least in Ireland -- I would invite you to vote massively in favour of the report . #% No one in Europe has lost their identity but , and this is the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interests which are social and economic , as I often say ` spilling their sweat and not their blood ' , and by doing that we can breakdown the barriers and centuries and the new Europe will have evolved . #% A yes or no answer will do . #% The only person who mentioned the Swedish social model was the Swedish Minister for Industry . #% I believe that market liberalisation means there is practically no future for nuclear power without a huge change in the ability of states to promote it . #% May I congratulate Mrs Ahern on so enthusiastically taking up the work which Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz began . #% How do you intend to improve the evaluation of the impact assessment in terms of cost ? #% Obviously something must be done . #% It has been very interesting listening to the Commissioner . #% I reject any suggestion that I have not done so . #% This House must send out a clear signal here today that we in the European Parliament , representing the citizens , want them to work in good faith . #% Far too often in the past we have seen costly development plans collapse because of environmental considerations that were not addressed at the initial planning stage . #% I hope that more funds will be available for renewables in the future . #% Can we achieve a proper balance ? #% First of all , they involve very high pressure equipment , which would present health and safety risks to mechanics who do not have the expertise to service them . #% In Ireland too we have our problems . #% I believe we are different . #% We must not become emotional about this issue . #% On the detail , briefly , my group wishes to add dimensions other than the economic and that now is clearly a matter of consensus . #% I am glad to learn that at the meeting of the foreign ministers this week , there was a constructive exchange of views with regard to the need for the new treaty . #% Now there are a significant number in my group from neutral and non-neutral countries alike who are actually very much against the whole idea of the creation of a European defence identity , and the debate within the neutral countries is being conducted in an extremely dishonest fashion . #% The time has come now to countenance a qualitatively different policy response . #% I have serious problems with all of this , and think we are taking the wrong approach . #% I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion . #% Therefore we will be voting as groups against that amendment . #% Mr President , the Commissioner has received a great deal of advice today , so I am not going to repeat anything other than the fact that we all hope that Romania and Bulgaria will meet the criteria and join the European Union . #% Root and branch changes are essential , in which the primacy of the nation state should be reestablished and Brussels centralisation reversed , with wide-ranging powers repatriated to national governments and parliaments . #% Ensuring safety , while ensuring that environmental concerns are met by the sector in a responsible manner , both in reducing noise pollution and reducing the volume of emissions generated , is a primary concern . #% The total cost loss to the UK last year was GBP300 million , an increase of 55 % on 1999 . #% My substantive question is : I would like to know - in the present crisis and on a temporary basis - would you be prepared with regard to intervention , to consider raising carcass weights and price ? #% I , too , want to wish him well in the work he is going to do for us in the European Union over the next six months . #% The European Union must be to the forefront in persuading our international partners to agree to all aspects of Kyoto . #% We must recall that the Treaties of the European Union incorporated judicial cooperation in civil matters in 1993 . #% As an Irish Member I must refer to the Sellafield plant in the UK . #% We have to recognize this as a cultural service that we must protect and support . #% It looks at the figures and it comes to its conclusion that everything does not fit together and that it can not give discharge . #% I call on Member States to review their national legislation to promote parity and genuine democracy in politics , review their constitution , legislation and practice , enshrine gender equality as a fundamental principle in their constitutions and take measures aiming at the reconciliation of social , family and professional life , in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and the Lisbon Strategy , thereby creating an enabling environment for women 's full participation in politics . #% This Parliament should take its role seriously in protecting fish stocks and not just protect basic selfish national interests . #% In spite of what Mr Wynn has just said , this is a very human problem and one which needs to be addressed . #% in writing . - While recreational angling constitutes just a small catch percentage of Europe 's fishing industry , it is an integral economic and social element of many parts of the EU , particularly Ireland East . #% However , there are three reasons why I ask this question . #% It is essential that police cooperation in connection with Europol be extended to new areas such as counterfeiting Euro notes and coins . #% It is not an internal matter , it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly , privately , that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again , the Czech Republic 's EU entry chances would be harmed . #% The European Union does have competence in research and technological development - Title XVII of the EC Treaty . #% I would like to hear a bit more about the European southern laboratory . #% An enormous step forward has been taken , but we still must reach a conclusion on the text . #% In the case of the that vessel was illegal . #% It strikes me that while we talk consistently , and correctly , about the need to create equal opportunities in the European Union that in a very real sense that is a secondary objective to treating people with equality , because there is a distinct difference between the question of equality for every single human being and the idea that they should also have equal opportunities . #% You seemed to say that it would only be in very exceptional circumstances . #% This Parliament can not afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions , be it Parliament or the Commission or , indeed the Council , being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time . #% I welcome any agreement that guarantees protection of the rainforests of our planet , if such agreements also advance the protection of the indigenous people of the forest and give a better life to the majority of the people in the countries concerned . #% This would obviously destroy the beef market , not only in Ireland but in some other places and allow meat factories to further reduce prices to farmers . #% Stocks of blue and white marlin are severely depleted in the Atlantic and they do need protection . #% They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime . #% I am very short but would appreciate it if you would look over here occasionally ! #% I have a right to defend myself under Rule 108 and you are wasting my time by interrupting me . #% We need to look at where we are going . #% Some of these have been outlined by Mr Miller . #% My view concerning Romania and Bulgaria -- particularly Romania -- is that membership of the European Union would be good for those children who find themselves abandoned or in care . #% Early-stage researchers benefit greatly from the practical support and advice from more experienced researchers . #% in writing . - I am opposed to nuclear fission power on the principle of safety , while I support ongoing research into the potential of nuclear fusion as a possible safer alternative in the longer term . #% I compliment the many voluntary participants and , in particular , the teachers without whose involvement the programmes could not succeed . #% We know from the grassroots organisations on the ground that this is far from the truth . #% On the one hand , there is no doubt that simplifying the existing vehicle tax system to remove obstacles and distortions to the free circulation of passenger cars within the internal market is long overdue . #% I appeal for something to be done about it . #% 
I hope that the other groups will agree with the PPE-DE Group on that issue . #% There has to be accountability here . #% Instances were found where vessels were larger in reality than was actually indicated in the national registry of vessels . #% Ireland is holding a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty . #% It concerns the UK Charities Commissioner , in particular the Director of the Neurofibromatosis Association , and her information to this Parliament , for which she was later censured . #% But I will ensure that the concerns raised here today are brought to the attention of the President-in-Office of the Council . #% In fairness , Mr Barroso has responded : he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns . #% A lot of people derided him or laughed at him because of what he had said . #% It is right to encourage and prepare for those conditions . #% As an admirer of the ancient civilisation of the Iraqi people , I find it hard to accept that the population has been allowed to suffer so much in the economic interests of others and been attacked both from within and without . #% Mr President , I meant no disrespect to you or to Mr Rübig , who has produced an excellent report , or to the Commissioner , by being late , but , as my colleague has explained , it was completely outside my control . #% Coming as I do from a small island state similar to Malta , I can testify to the EU 's commitment to the development of small and underdeveloped peripheral regions . #% Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the state-run tote . #% Until we can clarify this confusion and incorporate the International Civil Aviation Organization 's guidelines and requirements properly , would the Council not seek to ban the transport of this material over the territories of the Member States and require organizations , such as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd , to refrain from issuing assertions that it has been officially designated as low-dispersal material , because this is not helpful and , indeed , extremely misleading in this context ? #% Now bring your energy home . #% I should also like to ask about the Council 's position on LSD and other illegal narcotics . #% Is it soft law or hard law ? #% We have seen in the past that companies responsible for feed scandals never go to jail ; those responsible within those companies are never properly penalised . #% Mrs Doyle has listed many of the technical points I wished to make about the conditions of junior working doctors . #% Instead , the doors have been tightly closed to keep those countries out until the rules are changed to suit the big and wealthy countries in Europe . #% It denigrates this House and its Members when we refuse to allow people to hold opinions that we may not agree with . #% I believe that what is now proposed with this ` Charter ' will eventually lead to conflict between the interpretation of rights under the different documents , which could create a legal vacuum and , ironically , reduce the rights available . #% I believe that the European Commission , the European Parliament and the national member governments should redouble their efforts to publicise the public health information campaign ; this should be done either via the respective Departments of Health or through voluntary groups who play such an important role in helping those who are affected by such diseases . #% There is a gap between aspirations and their realization , rhetoric and substance , and economic guidelines and their implementation . #% It would encourage us to drive more and larger cars at high speeds so that we use more fossil fuels , preferably with only one occupant in each car . #% The people who really suffered in this were the farmers who were not actually involved in any way at all . #% My colleague , Mr Davies - who is not here tonight - has criticised me in committee . #% I too have met some of these people . #% I am glad that you say that it will be referred to in the Marina II study . #% This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured . #% How can we cooperate to effectively deliver assistance to the countries we are trying to assist ? #% Canada 's tar sands have become a playground for big oil companies like BP , Total and Shell . #% We in this Chamber are often criticised for not being radical enough in our opinions and our viewpoints . #% All new vehicles manufactured in the Union will be subject to compliance with the technical requirements and measures which will reduce their environmental impact , decrease associated noise pollution and increase their road safety . #% This recommendation should be seen as a first stage in the development of that framework . #% The Parliament has already shown more ambition than the Member States in relation to a reduction in carbon emissions , and today 's resolution is to be welcomed with calls for real financing , calls for strong targets in the high end from 25-40 % in line with the science , and the insistence on a legally binding agreement . #% Will it be more efficient ? #% Saving energy is like motherhood : it is always admired but seldom supported . #% I feel young people will not take up farming as a profession . #% This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective . #% They should be liable for any damage caused by such releases and they should be required to take out liability insurance just as every driver has to take out liability insurance in case he kills or injures another human being . #% Is DG SANCO taking any specific action to address this problem ? #% Freezing the budget level in practice means diverting money from the CAP and the Structural and Cohesion Funds into Eastern Europe . #% Galileo can play a key role in helping the European Union achieve the competitiveness goals set in Lisbon , goals which form a key plank of the Irish presidency 's programme . #% If it makes things more difficult , that is because it is a precautionary approach , it is the way we should approach aquaculture . #% The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line . #% We will shortly give him a tool to encourage him to carry out work on that basis . #% It is absolutely impossible ! #% It falls on its knees in front of the speculators and demands that the countries worst hit by the crisis , like Greece , make savage cuts in workers ' wages , pensions and public services . #% I welcome the Commission 's efforts to tackle the problem , in particular through the establishment of a task force in DG Regio in April 2002 and I reiterate our call to the Commission , when it submits future reports , to give more detailed information about the projects financed . #% This has to be a good omen for the future of the Cohesion Fund which has played and will continue to play a vitally important role for the participating countries . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the three main elements to it , of which we are already aware . #% The Irish compromise should at least take into account the transport of animals for slaughter with a maximum overall journey time . #% Mr President , I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% Think again , Commissioner . #% As regards correct identification , a microchip would be very useful in tracing the animal 's place of origin . #% I believe , with the good will and support of all concerned , China can make the same progress on human rights issues and we want to encourage it to do that . #% - It was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in Parliament today . #% They will make this Parliament more meaningful . #% Difficult issues which this Irish government must face are attributed to Brussels bureaucracy or over-regulation , whilst any good news is claimed as an Irish ministerial achievement . #% It is clearly the case that there is more room available for economy class passengers travelling with some airlines than with others . #% Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea and discharges into the sea which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents . #% As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , I would like to take this opportunity of restating that the result of the Nice Treaty referendum in Ireland should not be interpreted or construed as a vote against the enlargement of the European Union . #% It is essential to ensure that more information is available concerning the emission levels from within the Member States of the Union . #% It is absolutely essential that there be representatives from the fishing industry on this board . #% The fact that the phasing-out of these will be based on a case-by-case review , taking into account new information on details of uses and on safer alternatives , is a constructive and realistic way to encourage the affected industries to actively seek alternatives . #% 
Moreover , this same watchdog is made up of elected members of the sole party in government . #% in writing . - We all wish this new Commission well . #% Continued publications outlining the damage that narcotic and synthetic drugs can do to users must also be welcomed . #% Certainly the sentiment of what the Member raises is something the presidency , speaking as the presidency , would support . #% A successful outcome to these negotiations would mean saving the lives of millions of people in the world . #% Again I return to that point today . #% Ireland considers market access to be of particular importance and will , for example , support the removal of remaining tariff barriers to the fullest possible extent . #% The decision by the United Kingdom and Ireland to opt out -- although in our case this was for unavoidable reasons because of the UK position -- did not prevent this from happening . #% The current treaties already provide a way ; and if the Council wishes to add to that the spirit of Amsterdam , then we can proceed to an interim Commission appointment through that means . #% I have strong suspicions that multi-annual programmes have operated in a discriminatory fashion without producing any major benefits to the fishing sector as a whole . #% Mr President , I did not want to interrupt the vote earlier but I should like to refer back to the Nisticò report . #% Last weekend , a large demonstration in Hong Kong illustrated the genuine concerns that Article 23 laws could undermine existing human rights and civil and religious liberties . #% But , most importantly of all , it must be seen as a move towards guaranteeing better public services for all people . #% We must guarantee that the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks , which will take place in September , are a real success . #% Finally , the Lisbon Strategy , which we voted on today , is a strategy for good governance , good economic growth and , above all , employment creation , which is the best tool for tackling poverty , social disadvantage and isolation . #% This very week in that most notable of years 1690 , William , Prince of Orange , landed at Carrickfergus in my constituency and brought us in the United Kingdom the Glorious Revolution and the Williamite settlement , which to this day is the basis of freedom ... #% I welcome the initiative of those in my constituency who are proactively working on developing a product to meet the necessary stringent demands of European legislation . #% I believe that over the coming months we have a role to play in this Parliament , along with the Council and the Commission , to rebuild that relationship . #% Given the number of computers in homes , schools , workplaces , etc. , you can see how the savings mount up from the good sleeping habits of those machines . #% The euro has had a successful birth and is established as a world currency but it is still an infant . #% We know there is a very low level of harmonisation in this field , which is of vital importance for the single market . #% Please tell us what the options are and where you stand on this , Commissioner . #% A visible humanitarian strategy must be an absolute priority if the Afghan people are going to be able to live through a very cold winter . #% Are we now throwing in the towel ? #% From your answer , Commissioner , I did not get the impression that you were saying you would continue to disburse budgetary support . #% The main reason this is being raised in the European Parliament is to point out the lack of European harmonised standards in the nuclear industry . #% As many people have already said , the justification for the invasion and occupation of Iraq was about the existence of weapons of mass destruction but , as we all know , it was more about regime change . #% Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union , it is a relatively small amount of money . #% For that reason we need a dedicated unit within the Commission to draw together the many programmes . #% Mr President , this debate on the future of European road safety takes place at a time when mobile phone usage in Ireland and across Europe is rapidly increasing . #% The last six months have also seen a great momentum in the work of the European Union Convention . #% I do not want to see a repeat of the Cancun round of WTO talks , which was a lost opportunity and , indeed , set progress back in this regard by at least two years . #% A greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues . #% There is one way to ensure peace of mind , not only for our farmers and poultry producers but also for consumers , and that is to increase the resources of the Food and Veterinary Office so that it can keep the situation under surveillance . #% While I believe this report to be generally of benefit to European businesses , it must also be noted that it could leave the way open for an intensification of the kind of practices carried out by European City Guides . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission . #% We want young people because we want a living countryside . #% That was very much appreciated by all of us across the Groups in this House . #% Secondly , as has already been mentioned by my colleague with regard to peripherality - and the President-in-Office also mentioned this - the fact is that people leaving the Community would still be entitled to buy duty-free . #% We have had an interesting debate in producing this report in committee . #% This is my valedictory speech , Mr President . #% We must not do nothing . #% This is yet again , an outlandish attack on the CAP which has served us well . #% This drift in policy terms has to stop . #% If the European Parliament wishes to extend the internal or judicial review process , it should do so through an amendment to the Treaty in the first instance . #% Mr President , today 's debate is quite timely as industrial leaders in different parts of the world are pressurizing governments into dropping any plans for sanctions against Burma . #% The Commission already has a wonderful process of consultation in place with social partners . #% I also applaud the decision by the United States to sign the protocol . #% However , as others have said , the effectiveness or otherwise of this proposal as a means of reducing air traffic noise will only be known after the Commission has submitted its report on its findings in over five years ' time . #% It is , however , essential that we have a rapid system of intervention in order to reduce impediments to free movement and , wherever necessary , to provide compensation for losses for those adversely affected by such actions . #% I have already outlined at great length the moves which the Council is taking in this regard . #% They said very glibly ` textiles is the answer ' , but it has to be pointed out that the US is one of the most protectionist countries in textiles in the world . #% The most important issues that will be addressed this year will be the reform of the EU decision-making procedures , so that the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% Last week saw the downfall of a Commission in which some members had already made a start along the road to ` berthelisation ' , and in future we will always be ready to condemn any Commission that again succumbs to the Berthelot syndrome . #% The tax change will lower wage expectations and therefore inflationary expectations . #% My proposal , as rapporteur , to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty , did not obtain the required qualified majority . #% The report also draws attention to the fact , and Parliament notes this , that something like 40 % of all the EUR 14 billion spent in the cereals sector goes to 3 % of farmers , and 54 % of farmers only get approximately 5 % of the aid . #% This has to be addressed . #% All Member States must introduce - urgently - nationwide breast screening . #% In recent weeks the Taoiseach of Ireland , Mr Bertie Ahern , announced the decision to create a major digital park . #% It has achieved as good a balance as one could expect , because I recognise that this is not an easy area in which to balance all the different interests . #% Indeed , the trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical contracts has a strong gender and generational dimension . #% There is a broad consensus in Parliament about the role of services of general interest , economic interest , and of their importance . #% Indeed we already have evidence that this will lead to job losses not only in the finishing sector but also in increased imports of finished goods at the end of the day . #% The Commission and Parliament monitor submissions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact . #% Would it mean more financial support ? #% 
On the one hand there are added pressures from the West , mainly from the US and the Cairns Group , as we prepare to start negotiations on the next WTO round and , on the other , there are pressures from the East to reduce the cost of enlargement . #% If this committee is to work properly it is vital that it gets the time to do the job correctly . #% However , in determining what the financial perspective should be , the onus must be on the Member States to come up with a package , because once again they are the paymasters of future European Union action . #% Could I ask the Commissioner if he would circulate the research that has been done to show that cars running with daytime lights significantly reduces road accidents . #% It is a net reduction in emissions we want globally , not just exporting the problem from the West to the less developed regions . #% I believe it would be good if the Commissioner , on behalf of the 25 Member States , would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling . #% It augurs well for the change that we know must take place - a change that we have been hesitant to face up to for quite a considerable period of time . #% This has been a very controversial and difficult area to legislate in but today we have achieved a victory for common sense . #% Our hearings helped to elicit further understanding of this matter . #% However , the studies which have been carried out - and referred to here - on public health and , in particular , the health of children and babies , show that there is an urgent need to take action to resolve this problem . #% I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Cappato . #% Commissioner , do not listen to bad advice . #% The wool sector provides the potential to generate good employment in rural areas , provided we have proper structures in place . #% It creates jobs , it fits in with our priority of job creation . #% This right is limited to their own waters , at least so the Commission said in January when it more or less forced Sweden to exploit the depleted cod stocks in the Baltic and the North Sea . #% Mr President , now the vote is over , I would like to come back to the issue of a quorum . #% We still have no answer on the issue of training compensation . #% A recommendation is basically non-binding . #% Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war . #% The Commission 's proposal to launch a debate on MSY in advance of agreement by the Council and Parliament simply is not on . #% However , the failure to enforce these rules has left too many countries stagnating in an economic period that no longer exists . #% We are in a situation which sends a very bad signal from an ecological and sustainable fisheries point of view . #% We bring Sinn Féin 's agenda for change , for Irish unity and independence to this forum . #% The problems encountered on these islands , notably off the south-west and west coast of Ireland are not acceptable by any Community standard . #% I welcome the fact that the Irish Government is now going to establish a national forum on Europe to encourage everyone to reflect sensibly on the challenge , the message and the means of reconnecting people with the European vision . #% This unfortunately now leaves this area to the dictates of the interests of the more powerful states on the world stage and fails to provide a political presence and role for European values . #% We must show the way forward to be the best possible way of achieving the peace and stability we all crave for in that region of Europe . #% This can only be achieved if agreement can be reached by member countries of the World Trade Organisation . #% I ask today are we satisfied that enough is being done ? #% This right may be exercised in only two cases : if the contract was signed before the consumer knew the contractual terms and conditions and if he was subject to unfair pressure during the reflection period . #% The national cap on allowances can start from the 2003 emissions level and not from that of 1990 , provided that the allowances are decreased to the Kyoto figure by 2012 . #% We know only too well the cycle of violence , the tit -- for -- tat , the eye for an eye . #% It is completely unacceptable to torture animals in order to , supposedly , improve ourselves . #% Already it is estimated that at least 1 , 800 people could lose their jobs on the ferries in Ireland . #% We do need to take the public with us and if that was his point it is a valid one . #% To achieve real trade justice in this area , these agencies , which support approximately 10 % of world trade , must be taken into democratic public ownership . #% At the Vienna Summit it was clear that some Member States at least preferred to view this package in the narrowest possible manner as an accounting exercise . #% Near-misses are being reported more frequently . #% Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES , Appendix II , full stop . #% I understand considerable work has been done on laboratory-based blood tests for TB . #% In all the frayed work to alleviate the suffering and chaos , clear leadership and coordinated assistance are needed . #% But , while one sees the US hospital ships there , all we see from the EU is Member States going in from Belgium and Ireland and Britain or wherever . #% As many of my colleagues have mentioned , tourism is a very important industry . #% She had not intended the interpretation which has been made and I would appreciate it if this could be noted in the record of the House . #% With regard to the WTO , could you comment on the difference between free trade and fair trade ? #% Mr President , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important topic , which is most pertinent to my constituency of Connaught Ulster , covering virtually the entire northern and western coasts of Ireland . #% Interestingly , a recent House of Lords report on aviation 's contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years . #% It is time for action . #% I thank Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel for her support of the Committee on Women 's Rights ' opinion and look forward to the gender perspective being an important aspect of the European Research Area . #% The situation in Iraq is a dispiriting one , to say the least . #% This again draws attention to the whole thrust of the policy and whether or not we should review it with the idea of making it more compatible with regional policy and with social policy . #% This is very important because many people , when they write , feel that their letters disappear into some bottomless pit and nobody ever finds them again . #% The public must be made aware that it is often the practice of governments and the Council of Ministers to blame the Commission when things go wrong . #% As regards non-regulation by Community law , my understanding is that before 2002 a certain amount of EU funding was devoted to greyhound breeding in Ireland once funding for sheep breeding had stopped because there was an over-capacity of sheep . #% So you are saying you would keep the Irish people in the dark and bully them into voting ` yes ' . #% Mr President , I would like to raise an urgent matter concerning the operations of a Turkish-owned bank in the Netherlands known as Finansbank . #% That is a primary factor : that Members attend Parliament . #% I believe it is equally vital that the blacklist should also cover aircraft chartered from companies in non-EU countries and Member States should provide the European Commission with a list of carriers banned from their airspace . #% Thankfully , we got it under control , but it showed what can happen when there are problems . #% He also claimed that I leave Strasbourg early . #% It is through working together at EU and international level that we can do something important for children , who must be protected from such crimes . #% Let me briefly turn to two important issues mentioned by the President-in-Office , Mr Spring : enlargement and institutional reform . #% In conclusion , I support the proposals in the report . #% In Europe , children are routinely given the BCG vaccination , which has greater than 80 % effectiveness . #% I will speak English when I have to , to explain , but my own language comes first . #% I like Mr Deß 's idea of an amendment , and if he puts it forward I think I would like to support that amendment for a limit of two or even three years to get this job done . #% 
Mr President , it is surely amazing that the president of the Court of Auditors has to report on the loss of millions by the Commission . #% Vessels that fish under flags of convenience ignore all the rules , they exploit the best fishing grounds and they wreak havoc . #% I thank the President-in-Office for her positive response and for outlining the present position with regard to my question . #% By now , my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice . #% I have heard the word ` democracy ' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit . #% I want to ask the Commission if it agrees with me that in the present climate , when the European Commission is being put into a position of banning so many products and processes - even research itself in some instances - it is extremely important that what we do is seen to be soundly based and reliable . #% Secondly , we need to give a longer timespan for the guidelines to work . #% Bearing that in mind , as well as the comments made by other Members , it is important that a certain number of key factors are laid down so that the public can understand what we are about within this Parliament . #% To date the only effective method of killing the mosquito is by the use of DDT . #% I would like to welcome initiatives taken by the Irish government , including diverting 50 % of all household waste away from landfill sites , reducing by up to 65 % biodegradable waste consigned to landfill , developing broader waste recovery facilities and reducing methane emissions by up to 80 % . #% In conclusion , people are beginning to take a very pessimistic approach at this stage and , on balance , the overall proposal is likely to be rejected tomorrow . #% They fully support the common position on this issue , and that is why we would urge all Members to think with their hearts , but most importantly with their minds , about what protection they would like to see if they have ideas . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Mr President , I should like to say ` well done ' to the rapporteur : he has certainly shown a steady hand . #% It is in our interest to have a structured system in place at EU level to assist in the development of our own domestic requirements . #% This is particularly sad because a document that deals with the amount of hours someone works in a week applies to them more than any other group of workers in the EU . #% We must get the balance right : protect the natural beauty , heritage and environment that give an area its attraction , while at the same time make the most of natural assets to improve the local economy . #% I sat in on Question Time yesterday and the President-in-Office refused to answer virtually every single supplementary question put to him . #% Discrimination still exists , and it still takes women with `` fire in their bellies '' to make it through the dense system of hidden prejudice and break through in political , trade and other organisations . #% Mr President , first of all , cohesion funding has been very important in underpinning the success of the 2004 enlargement and , like others , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work in that area . #% However , all I can say to Mr Fatuzzo is : `` veni , vidi , vici '' . #% In Ireland , insurance companies trying to operate in other Member States have highlighted problems to me , such as different rates of tax relief on premiums paid to locally established insurers ; the requirement to appoint tax representatives - fiscal representatives as they are called ( we are not familiar with this notion and most companies do not have to appoint such agents ) - and to fill out detailed questionnaires ; there are also the problems associated with different rules on languages , and finally , there is the vexed question of minimum policy terms . #% We must provide young people with access to lifelong learning and to courses with practical training elements to enable them to take up these jobs and to grow and progress in their careers . #% I , like others , have concerns about proper controls on third-country imports . #% Civil enforcement provisions on patents could also negatively impact access to generic medicines , and the Commission should address this concern . #% I should like to know : if Parliament approves our amendment for an independent mid-term review , would the Commission accept such a review ? #% The areas of concern I have about the amendments and some of the proposals put forward relate firstly to tax harmonisation , which I oppose totally , and secondly to increased regulatory supervision over the operation of these funds , because we already have a raft of legislation governing investment vehicles and investment instruments . #% This is our objective . #% We are all very pleased at the success of Ireland 's presidency . #% We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard . #% It is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty . #% Could I add to that the name of one young man born and raised in Ireland , Tristan James Murray , whose mother comes from my part of Ireland in Wexford , and his Colombian colleague , Javier Nova , young environmentalists missing since July . #% I ask the Commissioner to clarify this situation . #% How exceptional would those circumstances have to be before you would continue to disburse budgetary support ? #% I am pleased that steps are being taken by the Commissioner to follow up on the commitments already made , and look forward to the outcome of the meeting on 8 July . #% On the particularly thorny question of reprocessing , we have high level waste that needs to be made safe much faster than is currently the case , and this processing should be continued . #% I do not agree with the British Prime Minister 's view that this problem should be tackled at national level . #% We must also make clear that adoption and reproductive rights ( including assisted human reproduction ) are not within the scope of the directive . #% It is quite clear that this is at the behest of the arms industry . #% According to a Belgian study presented last year to the European Respiratory Society Congress , it is estimated that one in seven city dwellers will show signs of lung damage caused by asbestos . #% The PPE appear to have weakened their support for these areas and are abandoning them by omitting them from the priorities of the text . #% in writing . - It is very important that the rules of economic governance are reinforced , especially in light of the economic crisis that many EU countries are still going through . #% Furthermore , an effective control of the CFP would also be incomplete if no measures are taken in the marketing of sea products . #% In their response , I note that the Commission has already launched a public consultation and has held hearings to exchange views with stakeholders . #% We are aware that diseases such as AIDS , Malaria and Meningitis have no frontiers . #% We can not ask Member States to take a leap in the dark . #% I can not be totally responsible for the way tabloid newspapers report things but I am still saying that I stand by what I said . #% I wonder how much faster we need to move in order to achieve this equality within the next hundred years , which even then would be quite a long period to have to wait . #% I should like to refer to the remarks made by the President-in-Office and Mr Ó Neachtain . #% This report is an important first step in making our citizens ' right to health protection , enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , a reality . #% These are national referendums and they should be allowed to be so . #% I am happy to see that in the caring provisions men are increasingly becoming , for example , state-registered nurses , giving wonderful care and cheering up the old ladies . #% It is absolutely essential that Europe sticks to what it believes in and we believe in human rights . #% Mr President , I am anxious to contribute to this debate to emphasise two main points . #% Look around the Middle East , and indeed the rest of the world , and what confronts us is an array of weapons of mass destruction , mostly supplied by the developed world , including the European Union . #% In the name of the peace-loving majority in Northern Ireland , I take this opportunity in this international forum to refute and reject that vile attack upon those I represent . #% Those close to our farming sector will be aware of the growing concern about the future viability of our traditional family farm structure . #% There remains the outstanding difficulty about firms and sectors whose costs may dramatically increase to the point where their competitive position could be destroyed . #% In America 's hour of need , after the 11 September attacks , Europe responded with unstinting support and solidarity , and rightly so . #% I respect the right of each Member State to decide on its own energy policy . #% It is not enough that we have these small , under-funded programmes . #% The most important issue moving forward is to examine the effectiveness of the technical design elements for the policy to deliver its full potential for environmental and economic efficiency , while also giving special attention to the situation of Ireland and other isolated territories , which are so particularly dependent on air transport services , both capital and regional areas . #% I am very glad that such relevant matters as drugs and child prostitution were debated yesterday , as well as all the other matters that are of concern to us here this week in Parliament . #% Our irresponsible and profligate use of energy , with its consequential emissions of C02 and other environmental hazards must stop . #% I urge the authorities to ensure that this investigation is absolutely open and transparent and involves UN experts and , if possible , Egyptian human rights organisations . #% I would also like to suggest that if men could become pregnant , abortion would not be a problem anywhere in the world . #% The common position does not guarantee this ' . #% 
On the Cañete report , there is cause for satisfaction . #% As there are no prescribed criteria in EU law governing the design or operation of nuclear facilities , how do we judge their safety of operation ? #% We need to train and retain scientists ; women scientists in particular are a wasted resource . #% We simply state what our conditions are and what is necessary in order to begin talks under the quartet based on Oslo . #% I do not believe that this would serve any constructive purpose . #% The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers , in particular young adults and minors , to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities . #% The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions , financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate both the rapporteur and the Commissioner . #% In the past , such an education policy would have correctly placed its emphasis on the need for all students in the EU to complete primary and second-level education . #% So anyone who suggests that this issue is solely an internal issue for Egypt is wrong . #% It is quite clear that the tactics of some people in this House were very sinister indeed : trying to put amendments in ; trying to get people who are health conscious to vote in favour of them . #% Madam President , I did not want to interrupt the voting when I arrived a little bit late . #% Mr President , I beg permission to raise a matter concerning human rights . #% Rather than lay out a wish list of every new policy or new idea , I want to touch very briefly on some of the points you raised and try to re-emphasise those within our role and work here in Parliament . #% The key concern in relation to the amendments to this directive is the deadline for achieving compliance with the proposed higher recovery and recycling targets . #% I welcome therefore the fact that language requirements are included for the certification of third country seafarers . #% I regret that one or two Commissioners did not shoulder their responsibilities but I regret that so many good people , including the President Mr Santer , who have done so much important work and achieved so much success have appeared in the eyes of Europe to be discredited when in fact they are people of honour who have done a good job . #% In the time available it is not possible to evaluate the proposals other than to say that the status quo is not an option , the bottom line must be a sustainable profit margin for farmers , and we need assurances that , whatever the outcome , they are fully protected in the context of the WTO talks . #% As regards the labelling of alcoholic beverages , my position is that consumers have a right to transparency and complete openness . #% Mr President , sadly the anti-Americanism of some in Europe is so great that I sense that some even take a perverse satisfaction from the turmoil prevailing in Iraq . #% If we have such a forum as of right , with the proper expertise there to listen to both sides , it will go a long way towards helping everyone to live in peace on this very vexed issue . #% It must be said that the Commission is to be congratulated on the speed with which it responded to the crisis and in particular the way in which it cooperated with NGOs in the region . #% There should be some visible EU presence . #% I think this directive is well over due . #% It has broad support from social platforms and civil society . #% The experience in my constituency is that businesses see no sign of it . #% Mr Adam clearly indicated the export possibilities for coal technology . #% Until we can clarify this confusion , could you please ban the transport of this material over the territories of the Member States and require organizations , such as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. , to refrain from issuing misleading assertions that it has been officially designated as a low-dispersal material , because this is not helpful and , indeed , extremely misleading in this context ? #% I say to colleagues and especially to you , Commissioner , that this has to stop . #% Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work . #% However , the option to engage in forestry activity can also be a very constructive and environmentally friendly mechanism for farmers to increase their existing income . #% I would remind the Commission that the Maastricht Treaty was very nearly derailed , largely because the general public in many of our Member States did not feel sufficiently involved in the debate leading up to Maastricht . #% Taking all these things together , why do we in this Chamber seem to speak about a crisis of confidence in Europe , when the level of crisis , fear and loathing which some people would have you believe exists is simply not there among the general public ? #% Mr President , I wish to thank the trade union organisations , the Commission and , indeed , the ambassador for their help with my research . #% Could we please have less regulation ; better regulation ; simpler regulation ; thoroughly vetted regulation ; risk-assessed regulation . #% Mr President , I wish the Danish presidency well in the run-up to the EU Summit this week in Brussels . #% Please tackle that . #% The Commissioner is probably aware that the Irish rail system is run by a state company in which the government is a shareholder . #% We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest , dedicated and extremely hard-working people . #% The fact that we have come close to full employment is a practical example of what is achievable . #% They need far-reaching and tangible help . #% In such an event the possibility of so many people being marooned is alarming . #% I strongly support the EU-US transatlantic alliance , but not in its present form , where we are simply expected to endorse US foreign policy objectives , even when we disagree with them . #% Therefore , the EU must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and , if not , then action must be taken . #% The European Parliament does not operate on a knee-jerk , reflex system . #% in writing . - These Mercosour talks represent a potentially dreadful development for the future of European agriculture . #% I wish to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , and particularly its chairman , Hedy d'Ancona , for accepting my amendment calling for appropriate facilities to be provided for pregnant women in prisons . #% However , I could not support the overall report because of the inclusion of issues which I believe to be , and indeed are , matters of subsidiarity - that is , the competence of the Member State - and therefore not issues about which the European Parliament should adopt a view . #% The structural funds have proven to be a successful vehicle for generating economic growth in the less well-off regions of the Union . #% I believe that the development of European tourism is inextricably linked to the development of transport and infrastructure across the EU . #% I would say to the Council and I would say to the presidency this morning : if you want to ensure that those who commit violations of humanitarian law are brought to justice ; if you want to send a clear message ; if you want to prevent more victims in the future , you should use your presidency to start a campaign at least among EU Member States . #% Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public . #% The Nuclear Inspectorate 's report stressed that the amount of high-level liquid waste continues to increase faster than BNFL can deal with it . #% In short , this new compromise directive may not give all political groups all of what they want , but it will remove many barriers to cross-border trade and services and reduce the red tape that businesses encounter when they try to expand into other EU countries . #% Any analysis of the evolution of the CFSP would regrettably have to conclude that the Maastricht Treaty sacrificed political integration to ensure economic integration and , as a consequence , undermine the EU 's potential to be a major foreign policy player on the world stage . #% Regarding the post-delivery verification system , once Israel declares where the goods come from , there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome Mr Holmes ' report and hope he makes a speedy recovery . #% While the EU has been helpful in providing additional resources , more is always necessary . #% It is of the utmost importance that we in Ireland do not get left behind our mainland European neighbours on the economically and socially vital issues of transport . #% Secondly , the Israeli supreme court has actually ruled that force-feeding is illegal -- and that in a country where they had quite a large production of through force-feeding . #% In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its everything-but-arms initiative . #% It is the least we can do for the parents and families of all the children who have been abducted , including Julie , Melissa and Lubna . #% We have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that , this time , citizens have easy access to all the information they require . #% The approval of this fund represents a key example of Europe 's commitment to helping Ireland out of the recession . #% We are going to get more bureaucracy , more red tape - and when you talk about greening the first pillar , what do you mean ? #% Access to such services in a fair and equitable manner is essential for the full functioning of the free market . #% 
I welcome the fact that the Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 per cent between the years 2008-2012 . #% A constituent of mine bought a flight online with the notorious Ryanair but when they went to collect the ticket they were denied access because they had an international student ID card and were refused boarding on the grounds that it was out of date . #% Why is it that we have failed to look at the structural problems that are causing people to drop out of education ? #% I believe that one of the neglected parts of the Lisbon agenda is greater social cohesion , which the IDA Programme will contribute to greatly , as well as , of course , the knowledge-based economy . #% It seems obvious also that people without the technical skills required to operate the technology would not only be unable to participate economically , they would be unable to participate in the democratic processes of society . #% The report deals with 70 different countries and eight thematic issues . #% In any city in Europe you can see the amount of respiratory and allergy problems caused by pollution in our cities . #% We all know that speed is of the essence in finding missing children , not only through the Internet which , when properly used , can be a powerful tool in finding people as quickly as possible , but also through the mobile phone networks . #% It is important that we continue to support these groups and their work . #% Minister Coughlan appears to want to divide the traditionally cohesive farming community by the exploitation of one group by another . #% I would argue that the list of possible functions is by no means exhaustive , and its accountability could also be ensured if it were required to produce an annual report and if its officers regularly appeared before the Parliament ' s Environment , Public Health Consumer Policy and Committee . #% In some cases they were not paid at all , in some cases only half the normal rate . #% It was subsequently that the European Union extended it to 200 miles . #% We could fill this hemicycle with reports of the accidents , leakages , damage to the environment , damage to human beings and damage to property caused by bad management , faulty construction and bad design of this type of Magnox plants . #% There is also agreement that the Chargés d'Affaires could return to Iraq from the Member States of the Union . #% I know that there are no Marco Polo projects in Ireland , but I intend to urge the interested parties in Munster and Ireland to look for projects that are acceptable under Marco Polo . #% I also strongly support the need to maintain export refunds as a crucial stabilising tool within the budget . #% Equally , security standards must be provided and improved so as to protect the interests of consumers at all times . #% We need to guarantee the safety of our food chain from farm to table . #% Mr President , the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new . #% For example , the addition of fluoride to drinking water has a disproportionately negative effect on bottle-fed babies and young children , as their reconstituted milk formula made from that public drinking water equates to their total diet . #% We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made . #% Regrettably , I am unable to add the name of the Council and the Presidency to the list of those I would like to thank . #% Today , over 200 million of the world 's children may be working illegally , denying them an education and childhood and putting their physical and mental health at risk . #% I am opposed to the arms industry but we must not put at risk the economic prosperity of Northern Ireland with ill-conceived and badly researched amendments in the European Parliament . #% We have failed them , failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available . #% But that is a detail for another day . #% But it is strange that many companies in Ireland which do not negotiate with trade unions representing their own workers at local level do not seem to have great difficulty dealing with unions at the national or European levels . #% However , it is not too late : Austria and Ireland have led the way where others must follow . #% Public transport vehicles and captive fleets should use clean and alternative fuels to provide a stimulus for the market , for the private sector , and to kick start the process of installing a network of forecourt outlets . #% We all know how the average supermarket likes to present itself to the consumer as a ` slasher ' of prices . #% This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enabling guideline , can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU . #% Mr Patten may forget , we will not forget . #% All nutritional health claims should be scientifically substantiated according to scientific best practice . #% It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families . #% In the protection of my constituents , my watchword is ` British standards for British citizens ' . #% In my view , the Conference of Presidents rightly considers that this House should express a political view on that matter at an early date . #% The products of aquaculture speak for themselves , and it is wild fish stocks that we should be looking at and addressing here . #% Mr President , monopolies are not acceptable , whether state or otherwise , and we must be careful with the single market not to create new private monopolies in the energy sector . #% I would therefore like some clarification on Article 14 from the Commission . #% We are looking at Africa but we must also look around us , to our own local societies . #% I hope this will have the wholehearted support of the House . #% Nonetheless , the United States ' Pentagon website has posted a list of 63 so-called favoured countries which President Bush wants to include in the bidding process for USD 18 billion of contracts to rebuild Iraq . #% In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time . #% The British government should make the honourable decision to close this nuclear white elephant once and for all . #% Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe . #% A target of 3 % of GDP on research is realistic and essential , as is the recruitment of far more scientists , including women . #% Not only do we lack scientific rigour in our approach , but we are possibly going to come into conflict with the WTO . #% in writing . - I wholeheartedly welcome this decision to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist the Waterford Crystal workers . #% In your own area of Cork in Ireland they would be tickled pink to think that we were discussing the feminine side of Pat Cox in Parliament this morning . #% It is about reducing the number of competitors and letting the large corporations loose to do their best . #% So there are no stocks out there waiting to be exploited . #% The US , a front runner in the field of biotech Industry is itself dealing with the difficulties of rapidly progressing GM food production sector where private sector involvement has lead to a market place dominated by global companies and the devastation of small producers who can not compete with ` corporate ' farming . #% In many countries and areas - such as where I come from in Northern Ireland - young children might not have had the opportunity to have that nourishment and that nutritional support supplied by milk if it had not been for the milk provided to them in schools . #% But let me make it clear that the renomination of Mr Jacques Santer or Madame Edith Cresson or some others to the interim Commission would not be acceptable to the ELDR Group in the light of recent events . #% In Ireland this drop is somewhere around 19 % with livestock farmers suffering even greater reductions in income . #% It is unacceptable to legislate on the basis of making science fit regulation . #% I also commend her recommendations to this House , and indeed share her concerns . #% We gave market access guarantees which we lived up to in the EU and in return we got no market guarantees . #% We see Member State governments -- the Swedish Government in particular -- utilising an opportunity given to it by the Socialist Group in this Parliament to express its opposition to the Services Directive when , for three years , it has been in favour of that directive . #% We want to be active persuaders and influencers in doing more , hence our commitment to the convention idea . #% Let us not forget that this is not just about those two countries living up to commitments that they made to us under the Copenhagen criteria and under their accession agreements . #% I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector . #% Following President Klaus 's signature and therefore the Treaty of Lisbon becoming a reality , the negotiations with the Council and Commission have become obsolete . #% If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including Community actions , on energy saving . #% That is why we are voting against this report . #% 
Mr President , six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries . #% I await with interest the evaluation report by the Commission as to whether the Food and Veterinary Office in Ireland has the right staff and infrastructure to enable it to carry out its duties effectively in the long term . #% We seem to be able to get weapons there for the Eritreans and Ethiopians to continue the war of aggression against each other over nonsensical issues and , at the same time , while the European Union and the Western World export weapons to Ethiopia and to Eritrea , the famine continues and the lives of millions and millions of people are threatened . #% Mental ill health is preventable and treatable . #% The European Parliament today must send a very strong message out to General Musharraf that his recent actions violate all respected international conventions and he is moving Pakistan in a very negative and very dangerous direction . #% The ELDR recognises that the primary responsibility for employment creation rests with Member States . #% Unless there is a price to be paid , those protagonists will not come to the table and will not make a deal . #% The continuity of farming as a sustainable career for new entrants has again been brought into focus . #% In effect , are we not really trading jobs and emissions ... #% We must recall that the European Union has been a success because the interests and concerns of both the smaller and the larger Member States are respected within the institutional structure in Europe . #% My appeal here , however , is that what could be perceived to be an ultimatum accept or leave the Union is most unhelpful in the run-in to a ratification process that is going to be difficult enough anyway , not just in Ireland , but in many Member States . #% There is a need for better coordination of human and veterinarian research on resistance , as well as further research on new antibiotics , alternative treatments and animal disease prevention and control practices . #% They are all issues worthy of debate , but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty . #% I welcome the action of the Irish Government in initiating a process whereby the extra options will be looked at . #% There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality . #% Could I appeal to you , Mr President , to consider , when Commissioner Palacio brings forward her nuclear package this autumn , that the very least that should be afforded to us in this Parliament and in national parliaments is the right of communication and consultation and full discussion on these matters , so that all our views for and against such issues can be properly aired . #% Could I ask that Commissioner Kyprianou bring this particular piece of legislation to his attention and immediately ` Lisbonproof ' it ? #% Finally , it is my view that it is regrettable that the European Commission has again come under attack in the context of the European Summit . #% In the context of the Agenda 2000 proposals price reductions can only be supported if they are accompanied by full payment to farmers so as to offset the effects of the proposed price reductions . #% Upon recalling the last 15 months , for example , we have witnessed the tsunami disaster in Asia ; the strong tropical cyclone in Louisiana and Mississippi ; the devastating floods in Romania , Bulgaria , Switzerland , Austria , Germany and France ; the serious drought in Spain and Portugal and the fires that have destroyed nearly 180 000 hectares of forest in Portugal . #% This crisis is having devastating consequences on world trade , but the demand of the United Nations financial summit last year , for example , that the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is the answer , is utterly wrong . #% It is paramount for the future of bioenergy increase that this increase should not jeopardise European or third countries ' ability to achieve environmental priorities , such as halting the loss of biodiversity , protecting forests , preventing soil degradation and achieving the good ecological status of its water body . #% In recent days , Madam President , we have been disturbed to read reports that suggest that Denmark may delay the adoption of this legislation on the grounds of a challenge on the legal base . #% But a nuclear future for Sellafield can be justified : not mixed oxide fuel production , not thermal oxide reprocessing at the MOX and THORP plants . #% Will the Commissioner undertake to ensure , even at this stage , that the Court 's decision will be reviewed and that the Italian authorities will be obliged ... #% One solution might be the use of model contracts . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , especially Mr Blak for his hard work on this report . #% Madam President , thank you for your support on my right under Rule 108 . #% According to the Commission , this measure was possible because opportunities had been created by the departure by a number of Far East vessels which used to target particular species . #% Mr President , I am disappointed that the Commissioner is not here but I fully appreciate that he is ill and wish him well . #% We must also ensure that the Commission is held to task with regard to the impact assessment it carries out on proposing legislation and the effect it will have on an industry . #% Let me finally say that I believe that the Commission has an inconsistency in policy . #% I do not want to be nationalistic . #% They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that . #% It is also regrettable if the Irish presidency is being forced and pressurised into finding some agreement on this during its term of office . #% Many of the underlying causes of the unsustainable bushmeat trade also cause poverty : weak local governance and unfavourable terms of trade . #% Therefore , I call on the Council now to ask the Commission to draw up a European Union regulation on the role and duties of au pairs but , more importantly , on the duties and responsibility of the families who invite them into their homes . #% While this Parliament is only consulted on this issue , I believe we have found good common ground between the staff of the Foundation , the management and indeed the Parliament here . #% I support the continuation of the MEDIA programme for the period 2007-2013 . #% Secondly , we are in favour of helping the people around the world who are dependent on growing drug crops because of the economic conditions in their own countries . #% I am also very concerned about reports on the hours that these cabin crew work and the consequent fatigue they suffer with no breaks allowed between shifts and 25 minute turnaround time during which they are required to carry out cleaning duties . #% But how this is to be regulated in the European Union is not so obvious . #% Some Member States and some NGOs have valiantly brought forward innovative initiatives to remove the barriers and obstacles to equal opportunity for all . #% The issue has stalled there . #% I thank him for raising it in the way he has . #% As a Member of Parliament representing a largely rural constituency , and coming from Ireland , the Member State most heavily dependent on agriculture , I fully endorse the stringent thrust of this proposal . #% Language often fails us on these occasions . #% I declare an interest in the equestrian area . #% As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive . #% In 1970 , 63 % of the world 's population lived in a rural environment , in 2020 it will be 45 per cent . #% In particular last year , when there was a breakdown of the peace process , these projects were vital peace lifelines . #% Indeed , as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have both said , it also cuts down on red tape . #% They have long working hours in difficult circumstances with little or no recognition in terms of government policy to the serious difficulties they are encountering . #% The complexity and the lack of clarity of the Nice Treaty allowed a huge range of issues to be tagged onto the debate during the Irish referendum , issues relevant and irrelevant to Nice , causing concern and fear among the people , which resulted in a huge abstention with a paltry 34 % turnout , of whom 54 % voted `` no '' . #% We must stop the Serb minority in Kosovo . #% The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism . #% I also hope that he will raise the issue of East Timor at some stage as a matter of urgency , perhaps in Cardiff . #% The traditional social partners - the unions and the employers - are certainly central to the process , but they have been joined by others : farmers , women , people with disabilities , the unemployed and other marginalised groups . #% A new treaty can not be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process . #% Mr President , like many other things in this world , if we were designing from the beginning a common agricultural policy today , I doubt very much it would take the shape or form we presently have . #% The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme . #% Most importantly in the debate about the future of Europe is the kind of Europe we want : do we want a democratically participative Europe , do we want a socially inclusive Europe ? #% I know that the US has recently opened a dialogue with various parties about prospects for confidence-building measures . #% Even the WTO itself recently confirmed to us that the US clearly agree because this is the basis which they use to ban the import and sale of dog and cat fur . #% It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union . #% It is a ludicrous thought . #% 
It is more difficult to put in place the legislative framework to allow for this to happen . #% Despite the fact that it holds itself up as the moral police force of the world , it is murdering people every year - and thinks that is right . #% President Mugabe has presided over the destruction of a once vibrant country . #% Again according to the report of Cáirde , in Ireland almost 3 000 people are HIV positive , and a further 3 000 people are affected when one considers the family members and children of those who are HIV-positive . #% Following the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco , this new protocol with Mauritania is obviously of key significance . #% I believe VRT is an anti-free market mechanism and one of the reasons why the EU passenger car market has not been functioning well . #% Legislation must be based on sound reliable data and all the scaremongering about self-employed drivers working 86 hours per week and causing accidents is just that : it is scaremongering and is not based on any reliable data . #% I support these measures and encourage more Member State cooperation , which will allow greater mobility for patients and experts to serve you , the citizen . #% What is worse , new policyholders were solicited and presented with a false impression of a company with a secure future in which their funds would prosper . #% One third of this fund , EUR 36 million , will be spent in the border county region , the remaining EUR 72 million being spent in Northern Ireland . #% It is difficult to recall a more challenging time for agriculture and the future of European farmers . #% in writing . - I support this report on implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid . #% There appears to me and to many other people in my country to be a conspiracy of silence on this issue . #% Democrats choose the camera shot , Sinn Fein chooses the rifle shot . #% It is important to bear in mind that this is an issue that can not be regulated by private enterprise . #% I agree that we need a properly functioning carbon credit market . #% A lot of people think this is quite acceptable , but I do not think it is acceptable that the European Union should want to be a military super power . #% Parliaments therefore have a right to be consulted and not to be bypassed over issues that impact directly on the lives of people within the European Union . #% By having one of our law-making institutions meeting and deciding issues in private , behind closed doors , we are denying the creation and the birth of that political space . #% Could I remind the IGC of another Irish poet , William Butler Yeats , who warned the founders of the Irish state to tread softly as they tread on our dreams . #% This must be tackled ; without ensuring that action is taken , it will not be effective . #% They say ` Oh , there is Big Brother Brussels telling us what to do again ' . #% Fiscal flexibility is paramount to improving European competitiveness . #% But the United Kingdom and Ireland have stayed out . #% One year after the Bonn Conference , it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU 's contribution in restoring peace , stability and credible political structures . #% I am very disappointed that the Commission , in its anti-dumping policy , does not always comply with Community interests . #% The consequences for farm income , and by implication the agricultural budget , are difficult at this time to comprehend . #% We certainly know it in macro-economic terms with regard to EMU . #% What I would like to ask the President-in-Office is , accepting that high priority has been placed on this issue in the Council in the past , why is it that we are still facing this problem ? #% This question should be addressed and I am happy that the President-in-Office agrees with me that this is an issue which the European Union should take up . #% For example , we need a code of conduct on arms exports . #% We have been able to reach a very wide consensus in Parliament across political and national boundaries on the Sixth Framework Programme . #% In my view they are not crying ` wolf ' . #% This is detailed in the monitoring report of the Enlargement Commission . #% I welcome the tone and content of the Commissioner 's contribution here today , but there is a lot of work to be done and I hope we will soon get down to doing it . #% I believe that , with the amount of effort that various members of committees have put in , particularly my own committee , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , we have achieved that balance and I believe that this proposal should be acceptable to the House . #% It is a crime if , as a result of late payments , small firms go to the wall . #% Mr Watson referred to the previous President Bush and the fact that to some extent the most recent President Bush maybe hopes to resolve some of his father 's failures . #% Mr President , would you please indicate to the House on what basis and why you wrote this letter cancelling the visit by Hedy d'Ancona and other Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs ? #% Therefore Member States should drop the notion that they are in some way protecting their populations by defending the idea of sovereignty , or indeed the idea that they are protecting their economies by pleading subsidiarity and proportionality . #% However , two weeks ago Parliament said ` no ' to a framework directive . #% I also welcome the proposals in Mr Lage 's report relating to the structural funds . #% I think only Sweden and Denmark have exceeded that , and the average European State produces something like 0.3 % , so we have arrived at half the ideal objective . #% If those people come in and if we are to realise the benefits of the enlarged membership through trade and economic growth , then we have to have something resembling a little Marshall Plan to help them to get off the ground so that all of us can reap the benefits of the wider Union . #% It is interesting to note that in 1995 , following the unilateral termination by Morocco of the fisheries agreement concluded in May 1992 for a period of four years and in view of the likely problems of negotiating a new agreement with Morocco , the Commission initiated negotiations with third countries so that vessels prevented from fishing as a result of any loss of fishing opportunities off Morocco could , if necessary , be moved elsewhere . #% matters of marital or family status #% With regard to the idea of sending a delegation from Parliament , if we agree to do that , it must build on the work of people who have already gone out , and not just be a sensational visit . #% I still totally disagree with the Council 's position on the last question . #% There has been no sudden calamitous increase in imports . #% Mr President , we are standing on the threshold of a truly historic European Council where we expect the final political decision will be taken to give the green light to ten applicant countries to become full Member States in 2004 . #% EU funds are required by Article 11 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1260/1999 to be truly additional , and not deployed to replace domestic funds . #% Mr President , like Mrs Breyer I voted against this report . #% It is an issue of vital importance to organic farmers and their customers and to all stakeholders . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his successful ban on driftnets , which was long overdue . #% The Burmese army still continues to perpetrate gross human rights abuses against ethnic civilian groups including beatings , rape , destruction of food supplies , forced relocation , torture , forced labour , extra-judicial summary executions and disappearances . #% The rapporteur refers to the experience of Scotland where local authorities take a lead in planning with other partners and this has been positive . #% I expect the Commission to take on board these concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year . #% I should like to say to both Mr Solana and Mr Patten that there is an enormous challenge to bring greater political coherence to this task . #% Let us stop young people choosing to do other things . #% That is why , when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund . #% Could I ask if that is the situation ? #% in writing . - There is something disturbing about a world apparently helpless to save innocent children from being blown apart in war . #% We should work towards ensuring that by 2003 , which is the European Year for disabled persons , we have guaranteed that the majority of those barriers have been removed . #% Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system ? #% The programme showed that , unfortunately , Ireland is one of a small number of countries that has failed to implement various EU directives on combating trafficking . #% Mr President , I would like to say that I believe that both Parliament and the Commission are most fortunate in having somebody of the calibre of Mr Poos to give us this very fine report which is long overdue . #% 
I also welcome the establishment of the forum on cybercrime . #% It is really important that we send out a signal from this House to ensure that they move speedily , because we are concerned at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to meet the deadline for the conclusion of negotiations . #% The market neither rewards nor compensates farmers for these achievements in areas where farming is at a natural disadvantage . #% Closer trade ties between the EU and Canada can only be built on a basis of respect for the wishes of the European public and for European law . #% I support the content of this report , however I do not feel that Amendment 21 proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which calls on the European Commission to identify measures to coordinate Member States ' fiscal policy and taxation , has any place in a report which purports to encourage innovation and competitiveness ; on the contrary it is only by fostering a greater sense of competitiveness between SMEs and other businesses across the EU in terms of their differing fiscal obligations and other variable market conditions that a truly competitive and innovative market will become a reality for all European businesses . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I too want to be associated with the words of thanks to you for your term of office . #% Within the European Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime has been put in place following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations . #% The only information we have about the rate of fraud and error comes from the Commission 's statement for the year 2000 . #% In a Union which will have nearly 500 million inhabitants in 2007 , the new programmes will form part of a new approach , building bridges between cultures and individuals . #% Those powers are clearly delineated between the institutions and the Parliament as a whole . #% We have a right , in this Parliament , to demand that there ought to be real action right across the European Union to put into place a strategy to defeat this terrible disease , should it again break forth . #% This presents us with certain opportunities to pursue the line suggested by the honourable Member . #% They are also worried that enhanced cooperation could create a first and second-class citizenship within the EU . #% They want to know exactly what the roles of a likely European Union Foreign Minister , and a possible President of the European Council , will be . #% From my own personal experience , the reverse is in fact true . #% The scandalous treatment of Dinesh Sakaria in Sweden , the spectacle made of the British plane-spotters in Greece , and the appalling conviction of Kevin Sweeney in the Netherlands convinces UK citizens that they are best served by maintaining the procedures and bulwarks of their common-law-based system rather than ever being tempted to trade it in for the flawed continental model . #% There was definitely a misunderstanding and many colleagues , in order to be here for the plenary today , had to leave home yesterday and incur the usual expenses . #% Madam President , the people that I represent have no confidence whatsoever in Commissioner Patten as far as law and order is concerned . #% I am glad to see it and to be able to take part in it . #% I abstained on this report for a number of reasons . #% Indeed , in Ireland , we can hang our heads in shame . #% The Brazilian Government , however , has been more than reluctant to help , and even more reluctant to ask for international aid . #% I would like to express my support for the concept of including a new special section for the engineering profession , as introduced by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% . I wish to draw the attention of the presidency to the Euratom Treaty . #% As they are currently drafted , they are misleading and have led both to business lobbying MEPs and complaining about the lack of clarity and to consumers letting us know that there are information gaps . #% We need to look more towards giving the skills and training to young people , middle-aged people , elderly people and those living in urban and rural areas to guarantee that they have equality of access to that training and new jobs . #% That image represents the final lifting of the artificial barriers that separated eastern and western Europe for so long . #% Not only have southern African countries been unwilling to exert pressure on Mr Mugabe , they have also allowed him to dictate the terms of Africa 's relationship with Europe , and that is worse . #% Unfortunately , research and development are still a monopoly of the richest regions . #% A second point I would like to raise is the question of the European Union and the coordination of our aid policies and our foreign policies . #% Marine pollution , accidental and deliberate , is one of the major threats to the marine environment of Western Europe . #% It is time to embrace the primacy of the nation states over the stifling control of Brussels . #% Therefore the onus is on us to ensure that we can put in place proper controls and measures , not with regard to access , but ensuring that parents can make certain their children will not be endangered by these new technologies and also that there is cooperation amongst the law enforcement agencies across the Member States . #% in writing . - I wish to record that I support this report on agreement between the EU and Russia on cooperation in science and technology . #% The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start-up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business . #% It was to be ` electricity too cheap to meter ' . #% They are flexible and responsive to change . #% This applies to both men and women . #% I query the degree of compatibility between the Commission 's commitment to the EU agricultural model , which is based on family farming , and the proposals in the world trade negotiations . #% This is a very short-sighted view , not least because the Polish and Irish examples disprove it . #% Others , such as the management at Sellafield , who deliberately conceal information and involve themselves in bad practices , be held accountable for their deeds . #% This obviously requires negotiation and agreement between various architects ' representative bodies in Ireland on a registration process . #% Mr President , while I welcome what has been said by the Council and the Commission , the reality today is that there is an ever-growing demand for fossil fuels . #% With the tragedy of FMD following on from BSE and swine fever we must review in a rational way the common agricultural policy . #% This way they can give assistance rather than having to transport people over long distances . #% I trust that this matter , which the President-in-Office knows something about as it affects the country of which he is Prime Minister , will be attended to . #% What we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis . #% The common fisheries policy seems always to be about control but the benefits never seem to come . #% Furthermore , there is no basis for such a proposal if we are really concerned with the welfare of the animals involved . #% Mr President , there has been severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice , not just here in this House , but throughout Europe . #% Unfortunately we have had other experiences of loss of consumer confidence in other food products . #% Not for the first time , the EU is being taken for a ride . #% I am not saying that Mr Dupuis , the Greens and the Socialists are not right to open up the argument . #% Is it true that the dates suggested by Mr Nisticò and others would drastically reduce the availability of stem cell lines to make the European Union totally dependent on the United States , Israel and other countries for lines under patent ? #% There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that . #% But there has to be that leap of faith , that moment in which , as a friend of mine said , we have to smile weakly and have a strong stomach and forget about the awful things we have done to each other and start to try and address the dreadful issues in the Middle East which are central to practically every single major political issue in the world today . #% The question of the decommissioning of weapons in Northern Ireland is a very delicate and deeply sensitive question . #% Only a few kilograms of separated plutonium are needed to build a crude nuclear explosive device . #% We fix the guide price and then base compensation on the average market price . #% Unfortunately , that has not yet been agreed , but we would ask the Commission to proceed in this direction . #% I found it fascinating , but also frustrating . #% I am totally opposed to trying to impose this on off-road vehicles , be they vehicles that are used on farms , or the many other vehicles used in quarries or elsewhere . #% Our citizens want more Europe . #% The stores down there are empty . #% However , we will have to ensure that the burden of admitting these new countries , all of whom will be net beneficiaries from the EU budget for the foreseeable future , must be shared equally by the existing Member States . #% 
It is one step less than we would like , because we want observer status and we request that . #% Now the world again faces a crisis and it is more vital than ever that we retain this link and work together to resolve the problems which have beset the world economy . #% It prescribes a very rigid regime of farming by dates : not exactly as nature intended . #% We also agree that there should be an emphasis on fuel poverty . #% The third thing is that we can not see the future because we can not get an agreement with the Americans . #% Is it a question for Member States or is it an initiative that must be taken by the European Union ? #% I deplore the fact that the resolution does not reflect the concerns of our citizens at the unlawful killing of Iraqis by the occupation forces . #% Principle number one of the European Union is respect for difference . #% The Commission and EIB therefore should act together with national governments in implementing the TENs packages through the use of loan guarantees and other financial investments . #% In particular , the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers , who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports . #% We could be about to really influence the energy agenda for the year 2000 and Mr Linkohr 's proposal for the right of access for renewables to the electricity network is crucial . #% Federalist parties for federalist politicians might make some intellectual sense , but I would welcome a fight with them any day in my constituency . #% So I would pose the question : how can we be confident that a programme to control the fishing effort of a large and powerful fleet would be successful ? #% Please believe me when I say that I do not believe that the Irish people wish to deny the accession countries the opportunities and support that we as a small under-developed country have experienced and put to great use over the last three decades . #% The hierarchy system as a priority order forces legislators in waste prevention and management policy to apply prevention as key , followed by re-use , then recycling , with recovery and disposal at the lower end . #% I have just been looking at the text of the joint motion for a resolution . #% This initiative specifies that it should include trafficking in human beings , and I wish to insist that this should also include the smuggling of illegal immigrants , prostitution rings and the sexual exploitation of children . #% The approval of the Irish application for aid under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will contribute to the re-training and up-skilling of the workers in question . #% In this respect I believe that EU standard setting on the basic qualifications and retraining programmes for driving examiners is a positive development . #% Any reading of the record will show that the strength of my reply here today indicates that we are at one with Parliament . #% If we are to develop a Europe in which our people have a share , we must give them a role in creating that Europe and sharing that Europe . #% It is now up to us in this Parliament and future presidencies to develop them further . #% I feel that whilst each of us in this House would welcome the opportunity to ensure a safer working environment , not only for employees , but also for consumers and other users of transport and so on , we have to ensure that we do not over-regulate in any individual area . #% Today the Union is much enlarged and there are only 6 million farmers . #% These Member States , which are collaborating , were let off the hook totally . #% We seriously require support through the industry : decommissioning , a reduction in size of the fishing fleet and fishing time so that we can at least leave those left in the industry some hope of survival . #% Other measures are mentioned in the report , such as implementing new technical measures , compulsory landing of catches in specific fishing ports and a fixed reference price for non-human-consumption species . #% In short , the consumer must at all times be given a choice . #% Mr President , the proposals for the reform of the CAP made by Mr Fischler are being driven by the World Trade Organisation , and farmers need to realise that should be their real target . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and the Commissioner for her interest and , indeed , involvement in this important issue . #% I have to admit that extending that to the applicant countries seems to me , in view of the length of time we have spent getting to where we are in the present Union , to be a daunting task , but I am convinced that the Commission is working towards it . #% The negotiators will have to move into a higher gear if they are to reach successful conclusions . #% Finally , a word to the College of Commissioners in general . #% Madam President , first I wish to compliment the rapporteur Mr Novo for his excellent report . #% If we want our farmers to continue producing and ensure food security for Europe , we can not , by regulation and withdrawal of support , literally force them out of business . #% This is a serious matter , and I trust that tonight the Commissioner will take this to heart and to his very soul . #% Ireland 's future relationship with the European Union is a critically important matter . #% in writing . - I believe any proposal to increase the EU budget to be unacceptable , on the basis that I can not justify to my constituents increasing EU spending by nearly 6 % in 2011 . #% Mr President , both Mr Watson 's and your own comments would lead one to assume that somehow an invitation was conveyed to Mr Giscard d'Estaing and that he indicated he would not come . #% It is good to see that even although there is practically an empty Chamber they are still listening and taking note . #% Thank you for your answer , Madam President-in-Office , I appreciate it . #% We must act before it is too late to reverse the trend in rising global food prices . #% So , the Commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services . #% For an organisation to tolerate this , such a publicly known problem , shows it needs reform . #% We need to focus more on promoting and securing acceptance of women as they are , rather than allowing the advertising industry to impose some sort of idea of beauty as the norm . #% The definition of the family goes far beyond the accepted norm in most Member States and other countries ; this issue should have been addressed more sensitively and the report fails badly in this respect . #% Mr President , I also want to congratulate Mr Pettinari on his report . #% Part of the EU 2020 strategy states that ` by 2020 , all young people in Europe must have the possibility to spend a part of their educational pathway in other Member States ' . #% In relation to the issue at hand I thank the honourable Member for his understanding . #% Mr President , one of the European Union 's key achievements has been the ability to promote educational cooperation programmes . #% What is common to all the public utilities across Europe is the fact that they were originally established to ensure there was a social equality with regard to the distribution of services . #% Airport charges play a pivotal role in allowing airlines the financial scope to offer customers low cost travel . #% Whatever the cost of developing the economies of rural areas , it will cost a great deal more in the long-term if we do not provide for the balanced development of both town and countryside . #% We want to be able to talk to you and engage with you on the question of suitability for the portfolios and to understand the capacities that you bring to this prospect . #% It is a well-known fact that the provisional IRA and Sinn Féin are inextricably linked . #% Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape . #% President Bashar al-Assad specifically recognised that Syria would not stay in Lebanon once the Lebanese people did not want them there . #% We also find it very alarming that incineration , which we consider detrimental to the environment , has actually now been included as something to aim for . #% Mr President , I wish to thank you personally for your efforts and assistance in trying to secure the release of my constituent from Liverpool , Ken Bigley , who was taken hostage in Iraq . #% I voted against this . #% Industry has voluntarily proposed to limit the use of PFOA by 2014 , which in itself is a clear sign that our instincts were right to insist on its inclusion in the legislation . #% By facilitating them in harming themselves or assisting them to avoid putting themselves in danger ? #% We must put the system in place immediately for its implementation . #% I want also to recognize that in spite of the need to contain spending we have met our commitments in the area of regional policy and we have gone on to increase commitments for the structural funds by 8.05 % . #% In Ireland , the sheep sector is melting down , with many farmers exiting the industry and therefore the imposition of these measures and costs on this sector at this time is unwelcome . #% Mr President , I would just like to endorse everything that Mr Howitt has said . #% 
It is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately . #% With regard to the Commissioner 's difficulty with + / -5 000 tonnes , I would say to you , Commissioner , that this was a pragmatic solution . #% If the policy is to be correctly implemented and used for the benefit of European citizens , the Acts which it has created must be relevant to the world of agriculture as it is today . #% We have to recognise that there is a repair job to be done so far as the common fisheries policy is concerned . #% A second alternative -- and the one that I recommend -- is to consider that science and research are positive , that the results of that work are of benefit to human beings and that this allows dialogue and provides an opening for work with Palestinians . #% It is my view that no Commissioner , from MacSharry to the present Commissioner Fischler - and I include as well Commission officials - would deliberately embark on a campaign to endanger public health . #% This year will undoubtedly be a decisive one for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe . #% Mr President , I want to raise the Irish Ferries shipping company 's plans to replace over 500 employees with low-paid slave labour provided by agency workers , many from outside the European Union . #% Despite the importance of the work that these bodies were charged with , including , among other issues , equality proofing legislation , these bodies have ceased to be , given the drastic cuts in funding available to them . #% So please could you let us have your assessment of the pros and cons to which you have referred . #% Monetary union requires this level of flexibility , so that more internal market competition can be stimulated . #% We need to maintain the CAP budget to ensure these vital environmental services are provided in Ireland and across Europe . #% Secondly , we are adamant that no potential agreement with Morocco should involve any access to waters of Western Sahara . #% Mr President , I fully endorse this excellent report by the rapporteur Mr Bowis , but I feel that little justice can be done to the topic of major neglected diseases in developing countries in just two minutes . #% I would like a further response from Council today . #% Mr President , this is perhaps one of the most important debates we have had in this House . #% Surely it is far from natural justice to refuse to take action now and to continue as if the future is bright , only to have more and more stocks decrease and to impose even further temporary or permanent closures . #% We have serious political obligations with regard to complying with the Kyoto provisions . #% I want to say in relation to BSE that farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% If they want to maintain Irish influence in Europe , and especially the respected reputation that we have painstakingly built up over the years , the best way of achieving this is to ratify the Treaty of Nice : to reject it is to reject enlargement and unravel the process . #% We have already heard about launchers and satellites . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report specifically because it urges the Commission to utilise current scientific evidence to protect EU citizens from the potential hazards of electromagnetic fields ( EMFs ) . #% The proposal that there should be a full-time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister . #% But this time it is extremely serious . #% I regret that in their contributions neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to make an acknowledgement of that sacrifice . #% As far as trade is concerned , we agree that a new WTO round is desirable , again subject to the constraints of sustainable development . #% The first concerns the point of procedure addressed by Mr Oostlander , namely that various colleagues felt , because of the sensitivity of the issue in hand , that they should like to have in their own language , as is their right , the text of the report and all the amendments to it . #% The letter is signed by my colleague Professor Trakatellis and me . #% We are against such an approach . #% We have heard from our colleague , Mr Cushnahan , who went there at great personal risk to fulfil a mission , who reported honestly and in a principled fashion on the situation that he witnessed . #% The Irish army was stationed in Lebanon for many years as a peacekeeping force , and there is a great affinity between the Irish and the Lebanese because of this . #% Why was the UN Council taken by surprise ? #% With the pressure on the various Member States from ordinary citizens , the Commission will just have to concede that a study will have to be done in this case . #% The European Union is committed to working closely with the UN , the US and Russia in seeking ways to encourage and assist the parties involved to end the conflict and move towards a permanent peace . #% We are trying to balance flexibility with security for workers who , in many countries , still do not have any security at all . #% I support the innovative approach taken by the Commission in proposing rules that will cover security measures during flights . #% Our President has communicated to you a scheme that we would commend . #% There have been other very welcome moves because there were restrictions on trade union pluralism , a total ban on freedom of association and collective bargaining for government employees and teachers and the illegality of one of the two major Korean union confederations - the KCTU . #% Mr President , as Chairman of the College of Quaestors , I have been asked to help arrange transport to Parliament tomorrow for assistants coming from Brussels . #% I am sorry to have to say again and again that I can not accept the principle of relative stability without one reservation . #% The 8 000 net jobs which we gained last year , our best year ever , will not solve the problem in Holland or the UK . #% People know that the European project is necessary and important , but they are at a loss as to how they fit into the scheme of things . #% The Tobin tax is one model of a financial transaction tax which has been proposed . #% It failed . #% Being Irish I have long known -- but perhaps others have not -- of your opposition to the so-called European social model . #% It is short but its brevity belies its significance . #% I would advise other regions with serious problems of unemployment to study the work of the International Fund in Northern Ireland and the border counties . #% It is a first step in a good direction for the legislative process that will hopefully be completed in the not too distant future . #% In particular in relation to the installation he mentions , I will bring his comments to the attention of the Commission and ask if it sees grounds for taking any action . #% On 18 February another woman in the Community won her case in the European Court of Human Rights - Denise Mathews v. the UK Government . #% I believe that this House has the goodwill and determination to do just that . #% Another constituent got as far as London where he was then refused boarding on a continuing flight out of London to Europe . #% We fully support an immediate and generous response to the call by the UN for donors to contribute more than half a billion dollars in emergency aid , much of which has not materialised yet . #% It is time to tackle the underlying poverty situation in Haiti once and for all . #% He did say they might get a second chance it might not be the first time they voted against it . #% Your particular interest and feeling for this subject is inspirational to many of us here . #% Tonight I also take some pleasure in commiserating with our rapporteur . #% We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully . #% I ask Parliament and the Commission to give every support to this joint resolution . #% I also had the honour of being the rapporteur for the report on disability . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency , the Taoiseach , Minister Roche and Minister Cowen for the progress they have made on the European Constitution . #% Whilst I am also grateful to the Council and the Commission , I regret that the British and Irish governments did not ask for a higher sum of money . #% I understand , and I would like it confirmed , that the proposers -- the Australians -- have now withdrawn the proposal for a zero quota . #% My report , with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB . #% I received a lot of lobbying on this issue , and mush attention was devoted to it . #% My second point concerns the resolution itself , which contained a call for new elections . #% 
Lastly , European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality , the environment , and animal health and welfare . #% I would like to support her in this and , if anything , express the hope that we can soon add to the list more chemicals such as antimony , dioxins , and fluorosilic acid . #% Sadly , this agreement can not be straightforward . #% Those EU countries who have faced the might of terrorist destruction and who have succeeded , and are succeeding , against the terrorists should be encouraged to take a lead and help others who might be faced with a similar situation . #% The reason I abstained on this report was because there were some positive things in it but there was also a reluctance to deal with the reality of the situation . #% My question concerned the absolute destruction caused by the seals in the North Atlantic fisheries . #% At the end of the day what we need is a long-term programme - seven or ten years - with a bottom line that tells us what we can expect to achieve in the end and , in the meantime , the investment necessary . #% The European Union and its Member States have a number of very major political , social and economic problems to confront over the next few years . #% That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules . #% The European Union has to address this issue . #% Unfortunately it is clear that nuclear energy will continue to be Ukraine 's electricity plan for the future , so high engineering and security standards must be paramount in all other nuclear sites if a repetition of the 1986 disaster is to be avoided . #% Vessels differ in their environmental and social impact and preference should be given to funding the withdrawal of damaging units and the creation of less destructive units . #% For that reason , I am quite keen on the idea the Commission recently mentioned -- and perhaps the Commissioner might listen to what I have to say -- in relation to ` motorways of the sea ' . #% I will gladly provide more detailed information on that , Mr Commissioner . #% We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors . #% Rural villages quickly become dormitory towns with no sense of community . #% Is that deal affected by the Council 's decision ? #% This legislation , if it includes self-employed , will be virtually unenforceable . #% Taoiseach , Minister Roche , Ambassador Anderson , I join colleagues in welcoming you here this morning , particularly on behalf of my Irish colleagues in the PPE-DE Group . #% But much of the reason for high unemployment relates to other matters , not just World Trade Organization matters . #% Let us put the past behind us and start with a clean sheet of paper . #% I welcome the wide-ranging speech that the Taoiseach made to the House , which covered many key issues with which this House is concerned . #% America is wrong in its stance with regard to the International Criminal Court . #% We must ensure that while the economy is buoyant we invest wisely in rail and road networks and in other transport infrastructures . #% I understand the United Kingdom is looking at it . #% The regulation combines advances in European manufacturing and technology and increased levels of safety protection that the European consumer can expect . #% It has always been in the Council 's remit to consider ways of addressing the public 's fears . #% It is not possible in such a short time to give any meaningful background to the situation in Northern Ireland , but like any area where there is conflict , it is always a complex situation . #% We welcome the fact that this is occupying the attention of Helsinki . #% Mr President , I took over the job of committee draftsman following the heart attack of Mr Desama who was originally to have done the work for the committee . #% Madam President , this was an extremely important report . #% This is the root of the political problem which now faces us . #% If there is one thing that the European Parliament and the European Union have achieved , it is that ideal of respecting the dignity of difference . #% Europeans have an historic responsibility to clean up the climate mess we helped create . #% I agree strongly with our rapporteur that the EU must use all its clout and diplomatic skill to defend geographical indications . #% This is particularly the case on the continent of Africa . #% In relation to the Commission 's proposal , many of the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee were not taken on board in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , but I hope the amendments that have been tabled will be supported when the vote takes place . #% I am particularly pleased that I caught your eye on my last day in Parliament ! #% What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future . #% I accept her point that there will probably have to be compromise on all sides but I would be interested to know when she anticipates conciliation starting . #% In fact , if my amendments - which were modest - had been carried , the Cairo Conference and all the related issues would have been respected . #% Anybody who attempts to enter is shot on the spot or tried in military courts . #% Parliament does not want , or need , to be involved in micro-management , but it does give us an opportunity , through whatever structures we decide ourselves , to get involved at an early stage , thereby giving Parliament a much improved role in the whole area of transparency and accountability . #% We should also pave the way for the immediate introduction of trade and other economic sanctions in the event of China reneging on its promises . #% Obviously this most recent war has brought home to us the horrors of conflict and the toll that it takes on human populations and human infrastructure . #% So there is an opportunity to consider this matter in Singapore and at the Dublin European Council meeting in December . #% We are determined , after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government - Mrs Jackson 's party - to meet our requirements in the UK , in good faith , to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with . #% Peace talks between Israel and Lebanon which have been frozen since 1966 - and the conditions in which Israel ' s withdrawal from Lebanon is achieved - will be of particular importance for the safety of UNIFIL personnel who are based there . #% I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1989 . #% Mr President , Commissioner , in October 2000 , in Seoul ASEM leaders gave a commitment to support human rights , democracy and the rule of law , as a cornerstone of future Asia/Europe cooperation . #% We now have a crisis in agriculture particularly and that crisis needs to be addressed . #% I know you accept this , Commissioner , and you have said so in a previous response . #% Mr President , the Commissioner stated that exposure limit values for natural radiation were not deemed to be feasible , and I want to emphasise that point . #% So I would ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue of the harmonization of national laws on access to legal aid for all . #% Great : in a multi-national and cross-party body , that means our message will get through . #% As you know , I am a great admirer of yours and I am sure that you were as uncomfortable repeating your answer today as I was hearing it . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the proposed microfinance facility . #% No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves . #% The right -- both Europhiles and Europhobes -- have used this issue as a wedge in their campaign to renationalise health and safety regulations , ignoring the fact that , in an open , competitive economy , if you do not have European regulation , you will have no regulation . #% This is an area of European policy that a lot of citizens are very worried about . #% So why do we need a common approach ? #% Why is the European Union not ensuring that sanctions are imposed ? #% Indeed , the fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU . #% There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe . #% While the American government has halted the movement of potentially dangerous nuclear materials , BNFL is insisting that it will run its nuclear trains from reactors to its controversial Sellafield reprocessing plant . #% That is not what we want . #% 
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week . #% Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , on behalf of my group I welcome the tone of the Council 's contribution and the content of the Commission 's contribution . #% In my view , this takes away from the message . #% But we had been in contact with the Netherlands , which represent the presidency , and they were asked to investigate the matter . #% I urge the Irish Government to act swiftly to ensure that these resources are promptly and effectively used to meet the workers ' individual retraining and educational needs . #% We have three standing committees and perhaps we could on some selective audit basis pick some aspects of these and examine them . #% Ninety millimetres should be the minimum mesh size in order to protect nursery areas and reduce discards . #% At a national level , legislatures need to come down hard on those convicted , and resources must be given to police forces so that it is not for lack of finance or manpower that trafficking is allowed to continue . #% The European Union should ensure that car manufacturers construct all cars for the European market equipped fully with mobile phone kits . #% The Association of European Airlines has gone so far as to intimate that a certain sense of complacency exists in some governments , particularly the British Government , about seriously tackling the problem of air congestion . #% We must all continue to play an active and constructive role in the enlargement process . #% That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there -- it being a much older foundation . #% My personal priority today , as with the last speaker , is on the issue of financing the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland . #% I am not particularly exercised about ferrets one way or the other I have to confess , but I rather like the line Mr Whitehead took : we should look again and maybe ask some of the experts . #% Should we continue the emphasis on information and communication technologies which has been present in the fourth framework programme ? #% It is an appeal , therefore , for the quality of European democracy and not simply an appeal for the interests of Members of this House . #% It is not simply a question of car manufacturers and the technology they employ ; the governments have been particularly timid in bringing forward incentives , shall we say , for people to use vehicles other than their cars so they are not persuading people to do so . #% Not only fishermen , but also the general public of Ireland see the Irish Box as being of serious concern to them . #% No country had a programme which was sufficient in all areas . #% Premarital arrangements might be a good idea simply to concentrate the mind . #% For my part I have always believed that you acted in those controversies without fear or favour . #% Will consumers lose confidence in our food ? #% Could I say to the President and to the sessional services that it would be helpful if there were monitors in all the meeting rooms to ensure that we were fully au fait with what was happening in the House . #% I fear that if beef is allowed to take over the Florence Summit it will augur very badly for a successful summit in Dublin . #% Rebel groups are attacking relief agencies more frequently , forcing them to leave the area . #% Irish troops have always served in peace-keeping and humanitarian operations under the auspices of the United Nations . #% in writing . - This is a major report with important consequences for EU citizens . #% It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often tarnishes the image of the EU , is often not the fault of any EU institution but of the Member State itself . #% I would like to pursue this matter of the supply of arms to the Hutus . #% The failure of the PPE-DE resolution unequivocally to condemn the illegal activity of members of the Israeli defence forces and demand their prosecution is morally and politically indefensible . #% Europe was one quarter of the entire world . #% We are lucky to have two committed men , both of whom realise the importance of science . #% We should understand the reasoning behind this approach . #% It is clear that there is a great fear among many people , particularly the people who elected me , that this Charter will override national constitutions , in particular as regards the support and protection of fundamental institutions such as family , marriage and the protection of life , born and unborn . #% The companies who are currently pleading that they will be uncompetitive if they have to invest in order to create clean energy and more efficient technologies are the ones who escape scot-free ! #% It is now largely through the efforts of some highly motivated NGOs and some journalists that the full extent of the genetic time-bomb which was released in Chernobyl that day is revealed in its full horror . #% The Galileo technology is a very precise type of technology which will be used for military means . #% This is an area of legislation that can change rapidly . #% It is unacceptable politically and economically that some Member States should seek to revert to protectionist policies . #% We live in hope , and perhaps a review is the best way forward , as Mrs McNally indicated . #% However , you can look at all the models that you wish and analyse all the processes that have been put in place but the only way of increasing employment that has been successful is the reduction of labour costs . #% The threshold is far too high , since a lower one could be achieved . #% According to the legislation , working time includes when a self-employed person is at their work station . #% With the exception that I mentioned , I consider the common position as established by the Council to be a very good outcome for the European Parliament . #% Labelling , however , needs to be sensible . #% It makes a laughing-stock of the debates in this Parliament . #% I want it to be clarified that GMOs will never be allowed to contaminate an organic farm . #% Well , I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information , and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it , then we will have bad decisions . #% I should like to apologise to the Commissioner and to the House for not being here to take the question myself . #% Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and I am pleased that work is under way and in fact , near finalisation . #% I do not believe that this gives us a case to convert stocks of fish suitable for human consumption to animal and fish feed . #% Interestingly , scientists have now established that obese children and young people do not actually consume more junk food than children of healthy body weight , but their lifestyle contains a serious deficit of physical activity . #% I would also like to remind the House that 28 states -- not 25 -- participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey , Bulgaria and Romania should be included in any debate now about the future of Europe . #% This is due legal process . #% Irish fishermen have some serious concerns that must be taken into account . #% Cattle travel long distances to go to agricultural shows , but these animals are well cared for by their owners . #% Mr President , could I just remind all the Members in this House that whilst we may have difficulties or disagreements with regard to procedures or undue interference directed against individual Members of the Commission or anybody else , the most important issue we are discussing here today is the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people involved in the fishing industry . #% Reception countries are happily turning a blind eye to the people passing through their countries on the way to third countries . #% I support the main thrust of this directive as we must strike a balance between promoting commercial enterprise and protecting European consumers at all times . #% I welcome the recent article written by him in the New York Times in which he stated that the Palestinians were ready to end the conflict with Israel . #% In particular , a panel of experts to scrutinise finances will provide for ongoing rather than retrospective scrutiny allowing a rapid response to any irregularities . #% In particular , I would appeal for a guarantee for the safety of church personnel . #% I would especially like to pay tribute to the current Irish Government for the pivotal and skilful role it has played in bringing this initiative to fruition . #% We must protect fishing regions where our fish stocks are under threat and the Irish Box and the Irish Sea is one such region . #% We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these . #% We need to cooperate more closely to combat organised crime and international terrorism . #% 
I wish to draw attention to the derogation that sets the same recovery and recycling targets as for the other twelve Member States , but allows Ireland , Greece and Portugal longer to achieve them . #% No studies , analyses or reports of any kind have been provided on the economic and social impact of the drastic changes that the Commission would like to make to the structural policy on fisheries . #% The derogations that some Member States have under excise duties for different tax treatment of high and low sulphur fuels , again , exhibit the power to influence behaviour through fiscal incentives . #% Members of ICAT , including the EU , have agreed to prohibit the importation of big-eye and blue fin tuna from Equatorial Guinea . #% This CCCCTB proposal clearly sets out the path to tax harmonisation , that great but mostly unspoken threat to Irish prosperity . #% Why did you not tell it between March and December ? #% It will need to deal with the waste if we are to end this extravagance . #% But let me also say in concluding that when we come to appoint an interim and future European Commission , my Group , which has been to the forefront in criticising the current Commission , wishes to make it abundantly clear , that our wish is for a strong , independent political Commission ; and any attempt to weaken this in the future is one that we would resist in Parliamentary terms . #% The opium trade is now said to provide work for 7 % of the Afghan population . #% We must at all costs avoid the creation of scientific cartels . #% It has recently been revealed that international paedophile groups are targeting child-friendly sites on the Internet to trace potential victims . #% Secondly , the deletion of mobile workers from Article 17 dilutes the opportunity for mobile workers to extend the reference period from 4 to 12 months . #% deputising for the rapporteur . - Mr President , we have had a very good debate this evening . #% However , we must continue to keep a watching brief on Hong Kong and I welcome the publication of the Commission 's recent report in that regard to which I hope we will be able to respond . #% You only have to look at what happened in Chernobyl which again was due to a negligent attitude . #% The Commission will not obtain their cooperation unless they are given the support they require . #% The initial advice which I have received is that citizenship , as described in the Union Treaties , applies to all persons who are citizens of a Member State . #% I ask you to support my amendments to extend the exclusive coastal fishing zone to 24 miles . #% While the people in my constituency identify with nationalist sentiment and aspirations in Northern Ireland they are by no means in any way hostile to the Unionist population in Northern Ireland , to their aspirations or their vision of the future for themselves . #% However , we in the European Union must be central to this . #% I also oppose the Council 's position that Member States should be given eight years , rather than the five years proposed by Parliament , to ensure that existing landfill sites comply with the terms laid out in this directive . #% It is not that the European Union does not have a stick , it simply refuses to even wave the stick , never mind use it . #% Negotiations which took place at the Nice Summit with regard to this issue guaranteed that unanimity was retained for decisions on all taxation questions at EU level . #% I am quite sure that we can find at least 30 minutes to enable the Commissioner to do that , and to demonstrate that this is a credible political forum for the people of Europe . #% The provision of water for domestic needs , as a necessity of daily life , for economic needs and for farming and other activities must be guaranteed . #% We in Ireland have learned -- tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period -- what it is to live with terrorism . #% I appeal to the President-in-Office and to the incoming President-in-Office to reassure the House that whatever new initiatives are necessary will be undertaken . #% Approaching this with anything less than caution would be an insult to the people of my home country and of all of Europe who are facing their own budgetary concerns . #% The situation is critical , they need our protection now . #% If what we do and the legislation we pass is not soundly based in scientific rigour , we bring all the EU regulatory processes into disrepute ; and we are going down this road with many of the issues before us in these reports here today . #% This is not the end of the debate : this is a debate on a Green Paper and is the beginning of what I think will be a fairly long debate . #% Mr President , I love the word ` democracy ' because it puts the word ` people ' in front of the word ` rule ' -- government by the people , of the people , for the people . #% In conclusion , can I say that I am very pleased that the President has , this morning , referred to fisheries . #% The Italian presidency should now take up this issue and put it to the top of their agenda . #% Mr Desama quotes regional planning , agriculture , fisheries , transport , combatting fraud and the symptoms and difficulties related to climate change . #% Many of the issues being debated this morning , such as immigration , temporary protection for displaced persons and the level of harmonised penalties to be imposed on carriers transporting people without the necessary documents , are bound up with this dark world of conflict and criminal opportunism . #% This is an essential tool for communicating how Member States treat European law . #% Madam President , thank you very much indeed for arranging this very important debate at this particular time . #% We have not had a party to celebrate it and like many of us it is beginning to show its age . #% It makes no sense to require a farmer retiring under the farm retirement scheme to opt out totally of a career in which he has spent his whole life . #% We can look forward to working closely with those involved in the social economy sector across the Union and to further developing the social economy . #% I remain convinced that refunds constitute a fundamental element of the policy ; they play an important role in the management of agricultural markets and must be defended at WTO level . #% However , whatever we do , we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened . #% Or is it simply a case of a voluntary agreement that you hope to have with Member States ? #% The common position represents a delicate balance which supports the principles of liberalisation of the industry while giving due consideration to the particularities of individual Member States . #% This has been justified very clearly in the report . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , world capitalism is experiencing its worst crisis since the Great Depression . #% Why has it not happened ? #% This will only undermine farmers ' confidence in the ability of Europe and its institutions to bring stability to a sector already bedevilled recently by falling income and unstable markets . #% I plead with colleagues , whatever your views are on the important topics in that report , do not let what we do in this Parliament be misused and abused by those people . #% On managerial skills , you have to inculcate a culture of reform to thousands of people . #% However , the amendment was defeated as it would have interfered with the catching of sharks by EU industry . #% I do not share the view of some colleagues . #% No cures are currently available for neurodegenerative diseases and knowledge about prevention , treatment , and identification of risk factors is very limited . #% Mr President , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area . #% This whole revolutionary area - as I , being a former teacher , know - has the potential to combat digital illiteracy . #% This freedom is enshrined in the legal right upon which the basis of the European Union is founded . #% Mr President , this House frequently and properly raises its voice in support of the victims of terrorism . #% More needs to be done , but a lot has been done and we must recognise that . #% We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with . #% In relation to access to documents , you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation . #% Indeed , I can give you a list of other areas where there are serious problems . #% The European Union is footing that particular bill . #% There is no point using excellent fine words that we put on paper if we do not have the follow-through on both sides of the Atlantic and if we do not deliver . #% I also recognise that the silencing of guns , though welcome , is not peace , but merely the first tentative step on the road to peace . #% And how can you continue relations with the government of Colombia where , quite clearly , government-controlled agencies , especially the army , are ongoingly guilty of the most heinous crimes , as only recently shown in the horrific discovery of the mass grave of innocent murder victims in La Macarena . #% 
Mr President , ours is a Union that has shown itself capable of extraordinary achievement when it combines vision with political will . #% In my own country , Ireland , pharmaceutical industries account for EUR 37.4 billion in exports and account for almost 40 000 jobs directly and indirectly . #% This particular proposal addresses some clear weaknesses which have been highlighted in the control services . #% Borders are being shut down , sometimes arbitrarily , and sometimes following a terrorist attack . #% Only when the EU is seen to be contributing to the solution of major problems in society , such as poverty and unemployment , can we expect to enjoy their support and ensure the credibility of the Union and its policies and institutions . #% Where a consolidated approach means that the prior approval of all 25 Member States is necessary when formulating domestic fiscal policy ? #% But now the report is before the House and the House must now exercise its mandate however it sees fit . #% It shows us standing up for the common good and rejecting the very well-financed , and at times , almost threatening campaigns of the tobacco lobby and of the medium moguls . #% At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public 's attention . #% Consumers can agree - prior to the conclusion of the contract - that they can not bring proceedings against the other party in the courts of the Member States where they are domiciled . #% These are just some of the conditions that a steady accumulation of fluoride has inflicted on the Irish people . #% Our input into organisations such as the World Trade Organisation would be very much strengthened by the enlargement of the European Union . #% I argued that there should be a gradual opening-up of the various programmes to all of our neighbourhood policy countries . #% Could I raise an issue in advance of Question Time next week . #% The report also asks for an analysis of possible options for sanctions against tax havens , which we support without prejudice to a final position . #% It is necessary to bear in mind the sensitivities of the victims of terror and their families during the process and in its conclusion . #% However , what I wish to raise is the threat from SARS that may arise in Europe in the absence of any power at European level to deal with this matter in a concerted and coordinated way . #% My report calls for improvements in the fight against illegal fishing in several ways . #% The Lisbon Council asked the Commission to look at the possible need for an acceleration . #% SME restructuring and redundancies in smaller Member States , which has a serious impact on national , regional and local economies , will benefit very little from the EGAF . #% If we truly believe in job creation , and I know in this House there is a great commitment to that as a policy objective , public service protectionism , as distinct from a public service ethic , must play no part in our policy package . #% But by the time I reached the plenary , you had moved on automatically within a few minutes to Question 49 . #% Human rights clauses have had some success in the past . #% Senegal presents another problem . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to commend Mrs Pack and Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee for their dedicated efforts to secure the best agreement on the second phase of the Socrates programme . #% Fourthly , we are in favour of getting rid of useless and wasted ideologies and , in particular , we are there to take a political stance and a visionary outlook with regard to how best we can help everybody to live within a drug-free society . #% I wish you well in your work . #% We discussed it in the group and with other groups in this Parliament and passed a motion for a resolution on the plight of Amina Lawal . #% I want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in Ireland . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% I tend to believe that , to put it bluntly , this is a licence to plunder . #% My own experience of Ireland , which has done particularly well and is held up as an example , is that the money we have transferred over 15 years - which peaked in 1992 , before the present programme - went to public sector pay and social welfare rather than to economic infrastructure . #% There is an onus on the EU to recognise the plight of these people . #% It would be very regrettable if Japan , for example , were to surpass us in the new technologies which we have developed and researched over many years . #% These actions are to be welcomed and , in particular , the extrapolation of MRLs between species that could help to maintain on the market many products intended for minor species . #% Let people in , not these trophies . #% Because of its closer proximity to Ireland than to most parts of the British mainland , the Irish Government has again raised serious objections to the continued operation of this dangerous plant . #% That continues to place Irish citizens at a disadvantage , as Aarhus is the world 's most far-reaching treaty on environmental rights and guarantees public rights to access to information and public participation in environmental decision making . #% The most recent and blatant example of this was the case of an airline company , Ryanair , where the management of that company refused to negotiate with the trade union SIPTU in relation to a group of young , very badly paid baggage handlers . #% I , too , have had reason to be grateful for biotechnological advances as I am an insulin-dependent diabetic and I use insulin . #% We have also sadly witnessed many tragedies in recent times , as persons seeking to enter the European Union have died in awful circumstances . #% The present force of 7000 African Union troops is ill-equipped and , when you consider that the area they are covering is the size of France , it is quite impossible for them to police it . #% We can not be driven by emotion ; otherwise our credibility as legislators will be severely undermined . #% China has made great economic progress in recent decades and it is now a major player on the world stage , which delights us all . #% At the heart of the crisis in Pakistan are the feudal capitalist structures under which enormous levels of poverty flourish at the present time . #% We are disappointed at the cut from the expected ECU 700m , which of course led to the drawing up of proposals , down to a paltry ECU 100m , over one-third of which is to be spent on BSE . #% We are conscious of the damage inflicted on our society by alcohol abuse and the social costs that this entails . #% Could you comment on that in particular , and would you urge other Member States to do what Ireland did in relation to the new Member States already here ? #% Member States will be able to create mediation bodies to handle consumer complaints irrespective of whether they are national or cross-border . #% In addition , when you listen to some of the debate , it is like going back to the future , because the same issues and points that were raised in opposition to the first treaties in the 1950s , and to the second and subsequent treaties in the 1970s and 1980s , are being rehashed . #% Paragraph G is inaccurate . #% Complementary and alternative medicines , where scientifically substantiated , must be included in any Community action programme in the field of health . #% I should like to ask the President of Parliament to send a goodwill message to the Speaker of that Assembly in view of the difficult role and task she has ahead of her . #% I trust that many more charges will follow , for that is the only way to deal with the processes of terrorism . #% I am opposed to the standardisation or harmonisation of taxes and these issues can be and must be dealt with by means of co-ordinated measures . #% We have to look for change . #% To achieve these two objectives , it is necessary , as the rapporteur has said , to appropriately define what food supplements are ; it is necessary to put in place a scientific assessment of all the ingredients and their minimum and maximum doses ; it is necessary also to outline the key criteria for requirements with regard to consumer protection ; and of course , the quality of standards has to be looked into as well . #% This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved . #% The emphasis should be on encouraging healthy lifestyles and healthy diets , not on censoring information , as is the case in relation to the socalled nutrient profiles in Article 4 of this proposal . #% It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent . #% This type of cooperation is vital at present . #% This plan also proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness expertise and practice in areas such as appliance purchasing , use of energy in the home , building installations , heating systems , energy management in industry , the services sector and the public sector . #% I also want to thank the Commission for starting this discussion , which is certainly very timely . #% The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century . #% We need the release of all political prisoners , and we need to allow democracy to govern . #% In fact , we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established . #% 
We have done something serious about dealing with the criminals on the one hand and with our approach to immigration on the other . #% Critics frequently cite the fact that under Kyoto the earth 's temperature would only be 0.15 ° C lower than if we do nothing at all . #% A new framework directive on services -- a key measure needed to complete the internal market -- must also be implemented . #% That , concretely , is the prescription of the Commission . #% The point I would like to ask the Commissioner to consider particularly is the fact that the only test provided for in the EU and under Irish legislation is the single intradermal comparative test as specified in Directive 64/432 of the EC . #% That is the one way of guaranteeing that we can keep a food source going , provide employment and protect environmental considerations within our fishing waters . #% The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth , with notably Ireland , Finland , Greece , Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments . #% Considering the numerous political and economic changes that have taken place since the Seventh Framework Programme was adopted , it is necessary to amend FP7 to reflect the situation of the new reality . #% Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission . #% We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible . #% Like all good families , we should encourage those within our family who are trying to achieve more to pursue common ideals , goals and standards . #% In relation to the suggestion that a higher degree of the allocations should go to Member States whose market is most damaged , I would point out that for a country like Ireland , for example , which is a much smaller country than the United Kingdom , where we have something like a little more than half of the total number of cattle that they have in the United Kingdom , the knock-on effect has been significantly greater , because in our case we export 85 % of our product . #% As far as I can see , the officials based in these information offices rarely , if ever , make any serious efforts to defend the interests of this Parliament and its Members when these types of attacks are made . #% Madam President , this is not a very suitable subject to deal with through urgency . #% Next , the disabled . #% In Vietnam , persecution of Christians is rampant , being particularly dire in respect of minority Protestant Christian churches in Vietnam 's central highlands and the north . #% Let us do the business early and let us do the business well ! #% It has the advantage of clarity and certainty and avoids the endless institutional complications of the alternative proposed to us . #% Clearly the Commission 's detailed proposals will need to be tabled before any significant progress can be made in this matter . #% Though the IRA and Sinn Féin claim to have expelled or suspended up to ten members linked to this murder , their duplicity and double-dealing is amply illustrated by the fact that , three months after this murder , this cut-throat psychopath remained publicly proclaimed as one of Sinn Féin 's official treasurers . #% It is for politicians to make these balanced choices . #% We need an intergovernmental agreement which gives us something similar in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency . #% Remember it is 8 years down the line . #% In any event , they prevented meat trucks and other trucks from Ireland accessing routes through the UK to the continent . #% I welcome the fact that the revised directive excludes the following issues from patentability : processes of cloning human beings , processes for modifying the genome line genetic identity of human beings and use of human embryos for industrial and commercial purposes . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Jensen for her report and congratulating her on it . #% Mr President , considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common European security and defence policy . #% Every country has a right to promote its produce , but not at the expense of others ' . #% Mr President , as an aside , I should like to inform you that the Irish have just won the first race at the Cheltenham festival . #% It never fitted properly , because we did not respect the differences in Member States and we did not trust Member States to monitor their own pollution in that area . #% Sadly , the United Kingdom did not seek equal derogation , so we are beset with the foolish regulations I have described . #% A serious question mark hangs over the principle of applying state aids in such contexts but my Group would retain an open mind to a fair-minded review and reflection on the facts . #% If we have seen anything over the last few months , it is the inability of the European Union to speak with a single voice ; it is the failure by certain Member State governments within the European Union to agree with the majority of other Member States that has allowed this problem to continue and to get worse . #% Given the protracted uncertainty that the failure to come to a decision on lifting the feed ban has caused to farmers and industry , I sincerely hope that this dossier will be adopted at first reading . #% One thing we speakers from Ireland forgot to say was how much the European Union has contributed to the success we have . #% However , that does not stop us joining up the dots in the relevant areas of European law that exist at the moment . #% I do not like dealing with so serious an issue through the back door . #% Indeed , our postal service is one of the best in Europe . #% Gender equality is not only a matter of justice but also an imperative for social and economic development . #% We are all agreed that the way forward is through the democratic process . #% We know about the problem of black-market fish and what they can do to a market situation at a given time . #% Unless the Commission brings forward a detailed analysis of the money required in order to enable the schools to do their job properly , either in providing the special needs education within the schools or providing that education outside of those schools , then we are failing as a Union , and , indeed , as an employer of the parents of these children . #% As a democrat I have to accept the result of the vote on the Rothley report even if I do not agree with it . #% If there is a problem now with an interim Commission that has lost its moral and political authority to act , the problem arises , in my view , because of the failure of the Council to listen to Parliament and to appoint an effective interim Commission . #% European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings . #% However , in the intensity of debate on specific amendments , particularly relating to Article 16 on the freedom to provide services , let us not lose sight of the overall objective of what we are trying to achieve . #% Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known . #% It is not sarin gas which creates the spectacular death and destruction which the terrorists need for the 6 o'clock news . #% There is a definition which excludes the use of municipal waste , gives permission for successful support mechanisms to continue and thereby boosts investor confidence . #% For example , the insides of televisions can now be made completely of plastic instead of plastic and metal , making them easier to recycle . #% Ireland has one of the highest rates of VRT in Europe , with almost 10 % of the total tax take coming from motorists . #% No matter how good our tax regimes or infrastructure , if we do not have the brains , intelligence and capacity to utilise and exploit those ideas , then we will fail . #% This is utterly unacceptable . #% It requires a longer approach ; it requires more involvement of other presidencies ; it requires more involvement of other Member States . #% We need to ensure that our young people have opportunities to learn and to move abroad to continue their learning if they wish , as investing in education today will better equip the EU to face challenges in the future . #% Over the years , as the number of farms was reduced and farmers became more efficient , food obviously became more available to the poor who could buy it at a lower cost . #% Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report . #% It would be ideal if companies were to take their responsibilities seriously in terms of prompt payment but we know that is not the case and therefore minimum legislation is necessary to improve the business culture and ensure fair and good practice . #% If we do not close the loopholes that facilitate fraud we will compound our problems , resulting in increased cynicism and hostility towards the European Union . #% I reiterate , for my group , that we totally support this . #% However , let us not forget that it is our inventiveness and capacity for innovation in software and dependent technologies that can help Europe to meet its objective of being the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 . #% Implementation at this time of this rail liberalisation package will involve the setting up of a complex administrative structure without enjoying the subsequent benefits that other Member States would . #% My Group very much disagrees with the procedure and the result of the conciliation . #% In conclusion , as a result of the Cologne Summit of March of last year , it has been agreed that the EU budget will be worth over # 506 billion during the seven-year period , i.e. 2000-2006 . #% We are all conscious of the need to reduce the volume of waste now disposed of in landfill sites and every effort must be made to find more environmentally friendly alternatives . #% I hope that the British Government gives the necessary clarification in this case . #% 
He has demonstrated , yet again , that it is quality and vision that count in the construction of Europe . #% The importance of a vibrant European-based audiovisual industry can not be over-emphasised . #% But - and I enter a very strong caveat here - it is very important for the effect of consolidation on competition and financial stability to safeguard prices in what will , de facto , be a less competitive arena . #% So we probably only expand the market a little bit and give a bigger opportunity to the cheap labour areas . #% As rightly as we condemn all forms of violence , as rightly as we condemn the episodes that have taken place in Jenin , in the Church of the Nativity around Bethlehem , and the suicide bombers in the cafes and restaurants in Israel , we must also be willing and aware in order to assist in bringing the people together . #% Therefore I believe that legislative intervention should only be used as a last resort and to address proven market failure . #% This proposal is one of the measures provided for in the Commission 's White Paper on Food Safety . #% Since 1993 the free movement of goods , capital and persons has yielded enormous economic and social gains . #% This has been side-stepped down the years but it is high time that the Commission bites the bullet . #% I have one difficulty which is not exactly related to this , but I would appreciate a response from the Commissioner as to what the Commission will do about it . #% We often hear in this House and other establishments about the idea of lifelong learning . #% An honest assessment of the committee 's work to date would give a mixed picture , I believe . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% If I do not dwell on this , it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you , Mr President-in-Office . #% However , like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties , Article 191 , the article referred to , lacks a certain operational content . #% Let us , as responsible public representatives , try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them . #% I would like to say to Mr Prodi that we , in our group , believe that as part of his European vocation for a new millennium and for the new enlarged Europe - he should perhaps reflect on the desirability of introducing into the debate the concept of a constitution for Europe . #% Those who will not learn the lessons of history condemn themselves and society to repeat that history . #% People are alive today who would not be alive if this programme did not exist . #% I would like to thank her for her particular contribution . #% We can not ignore the reports of great human rights abuses . #% It is quite clear that in Vietnam that is not the situation . #% It highlights the dramatic rise and increase in employment in Sweden and Finland and the problems in Spain where 1 in 5 continue to be unemployed . #% The European Union is the largest contributor of development aid in the world and therefore must continue to show real leadership when it comes to addressing humanitarian and development aid problems in the world . #% Restoring confidence in the food chain has been a slow , tedious and indeed expensive process . #% Firstly , with regard to raising the limits on when tenders have to be put out for consultation , looking for the 50 % increase is important because it has already been proven that the present limits do not allow for greater cross-border interaction between companies and between companies and agencies . #% The Council 's common position has taken on board the majority of Parliament 's amendments from first reading , but there remain differences mainly concerning the following points . #% I could not help but think that many of those same ministers allocated billions to support banks , but were unable to support other financial institutions that would provide micro-credit to those who have lost their jobs and who would have difficulty in accessing credit from the same banks that have been saved . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer . #% Mr President , I support the cooperation which the European Union and the United States have undertaken for the fight against terrorism . #% When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning , we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration . #% I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups . #% Likewise , the proposed quota of EUR 525 million in structural fund payment appropriations . #% A colleague spoke about it earlier . #% To date we do not have level of funding either from the EU or from the Member States . #% When you move into a new home , there are always problems . #% For me this has been something of an exercise in bringing a directive to Parliament that , by the time I go for re-election will , I hope , be effective legislation . #% In Europe we went on to bring in the euro and concentrate on enlargement . #% Tonight , yet again , he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003 . #% This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future . #% Of course , any installation opting out must be required to take equivalent action to reduce emissions . #% This is what we are trying to achieve in these compromises . #% In this regard I compliment Commissioner Byrne - who is responsible for this specific area - and Commissioner Fischler . #% We now have mistakes to make up for . #% Having gone through the trauma of the allocation of fish quotas , there is a greater awareness throughout the European Union of the scarcity of this most important resource . #% Even if the conduct of foreign policy - and in particular , the security and defence dimension of foreign policy - is essentially for government , it follows that because of the nature of the policy terrain and the instruments available it can not be government 's exclusive concern . #% But we would like the statement of assurance of the Court of Auditors in relation to the revenue side of the budget and administration to be clearer . #% Golf courses do not qualify #% I am glad that mercury , which is probably the most neurotoxic pollutant of them all , comes under scrutiny in Mrs Ries ' report . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , this debate comes at a very timely juncture for tourism , the air travel industry and consumer protection . #% Basically they will be looking at what is the best kind of system to enable them to make more gains in the next election . #% What is obviously needed is a wholly independent Commissioner for standards in public life . #% The compositional quality and indeed the bacteriological quality of foods are more accurately measured today than ever before . #% It was the vigilance of this Parliament in particular that raised a warning flag in relation to many aspects of the application of this research . #% I welcome the fact that in future health warnings will have to apply in relation to the manufacture of these products . #% I understand why you were unable to do so and I hope your inability to show investment figures shows that in the future nuclear power should not be the main form of energy in this European Union . #% They are enormous responsibilities because they relate to the way people will lead their lives over the coming decades . #% Parliament should be informed , Member States should open up this discussion so that people in the Member States know what is going on before it is too late . #% The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union . #% UNIFIL II must also ensure that further arms are not smuggled into Lebanon to rearm any groups and that Lebanon 's sovereignty is respected at all times . #% I reiterate what the Tánaiste said earlier in the House . #% The technical breakdown in the system should not be held against them when it comes to counting time spent voting in this House . #% There is a great need to build public trust and confidence . #% EU leaders have rightly called on the Palestinian authorities to dismantle terrorist networks run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and to arrest and prosecute all such suspects and end the armed intifada . #% As such , these SMEs are the driving force of European job creation . #% Quite frankly , at this stage most businesses think that time is running out for Lisbon , if indeed it has not already run out . #% 
They represent only 3 % of world trade . #% Finally , I would like to add my voice to those who plea that we do something realistic about energy savings in Parliament buildings and in EU buildings in general . #% A cessation of violence was the fundamental precondition for the creation of a climate for political dialogue at Dayton . #% In the European Union there is free movement of goods , services , persons and capital with full regulation and , indeed , competition checks . #% But Mr Langen wisely reminds us of the enormous potential for European industry . #% We support their demand that all nuclear weapons should be taken off alert . #% The present rules are cumbersome and have led to duplication and high administrative costs . #% This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe . #% Finally , I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that , as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait , I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet . #% However , the Barcelona Council targets for childcare are yet to be attained , affecting lower income families the most . #% So where has the food gone and why have we only a small supply ? #% The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has also been severely disrupted . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Maat on his efforts because he tried hard to reach consensus . #% In the case of the structural funds - which are the one instrument of economic and social cohesion , and which represent a relatively modest amount of money bearing in mind that they transfer between 2 and 3 % of GNP to the Objective 1 regions - the fact that they have been underspent by 19 % is some cause for concern , because they are a rather precious instrument that should be utilized to the full . #% On the one hand , I feel it was politically motivated rather than scientifically based . #% This is not child pornography but gross and indecent sexual abuse . #% They are uncertain as to what the current hike in oil prices will mean , how long the side-effects will last and what to expect in the long term -- their future . #% Also , if we are serious about their value abroad , we must ensure more protection from third countries . #% These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely . #% In this regard , is it not imperative to guarantee two things : first , to guarantee that the case against the Constitution is not suppressed in a welter of one-sided propaganda emanating from the European institutions and , secondly , that the democratic referendum process is not distorted by unbalanced funding from external sources ? #% A 1 % per annum improvement would be very easy to achieve . #% In Ireland , as in all Member States , we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels . #% Just as you are responsive to us , we have to be responsive to those who elect us . #% I salute the courage of the hundreds of gay people and their supporters who braved the hate campaign against them to march in the Baltic Pride parade in Lithuania 's capital , Vilnius , in May of last year . #% Around 20 % of production could be saved simply by using energy-saving windows . #% In the area of agriculture Mr Tillich does not say much . #% The whole Union will become an impossible place if all the languages of the Union are to receive official status and be used in the whole conduct of the business of the Union . #% There is no other way of ensuring that parties are not corrupted . #% It is regrettable that , for party political reasons , some Members are not willing to recognise what everybody else sees , not just in this House but outside it . #% Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers . #% These are going to be difficult discussions and internal institutional reform is needed in the EU if the enlargement process is to be successful . #% If , added to that , is the experience of being taken from one jurisdiction to another and denied access to a mother or father - indeed , to grandparents and extended family - then the trauma is magnified . #% We enter into a social contract with our governments . #% It is unclear why this was so , but perhaps it is because it requires too much fishing effort because the stocks are in bad condition . #% We must all redouble our efforts so as to be sure that next year ' s World Summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a matter which protects existing communities . #% In my own country of Ireland there are many teachers and students who can testify to its success as a unique learning experience . #% Gama is , in my view , in breach of the anti-discrimination directives . #% We need to make sure that when it comes to the discharge of the 2008 budget , significantly more progress is made . #% Before the terms of a final EU Treaty are agreed upon , we must ensure that cautious , careful and wide-ranging discussions take place with all interested parties from both the large and the small countries . #% The creation and management of European companies must take place with as few hindrances and bureaucratic obstacles as possible . #% We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long-term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO2 and its impact on the environment . #% We must confront genocide and do everything we can to facilitate peace in the region . #% If we insist on democracy in this process -- not just in word but in reality -- then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept . #% My group believes that foreign policy is an area where decidedly we need more Europe , including a Europe with a security and defence capacity . #% The Court notes that the Single Payment Scheme has side effects , such as the allocation of entitlements to landowners who never exercised previous agricultural activity , leading to a substantial redistribution of EU aid away from farmers to landlords . #% I accept that these are not merely crumbs on the table , they are significant slices of reform but we must grasp this opportunity to do more . #% Surely , they can all be brought into a single directive . #% I would like to respectfully request colleagues and those who are lobbying for the signing of the register to allow Members the leeway and the freedom to sign these resolutions without having to go through ' a wall of fire ' to get into the Chamber . #% Unemployment levels should be used to determine eligibility for structural fund aid . #% It is also heartening to note that no fraud was found in connection with the projects which were financed and this is an example to follow in other areas . #% The deaths involved in such tragedies are often preventable , but we have to convince our Member States that when it comes to seatbelts , our children 's lives are not negotiable . #% Justice , it seems , is eluding these brave people and so they have come to us . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , we all understand the concerns of many of the other sectors within agriculture , and they almost certainly thought that we were placing far too much emphasis on trying to resolve the problems facing the dairy sector . #% Again , we have conflict , contradiction and dual standards . #% Mr President , the German Government has assumed the presidency of the European Union at a challenging time . #% I am pleased that we are using tried and tested mechanisms of structural and cohesion funding to achieve that important goal . #% Mr President , as usual , very sincerely meant congratulations to the three rapporteurs involved in this package . #% I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential . #% The failure to achieve targets for renewable energy - a failure for which the United States , to their shame , are largely responsible - can be overcome with goodwill and effort from the European Union . #% I ask the President-in-Office to try once more , otherwise we will have to ask the UN and the Americans to help us out . #% I believe that , in recent years , the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent . #% Just because something is natural , it does not necessarily mean it is healthy . #% We all accept that Mr Cashman 's excellent report is still and I do not mean to denigrate it - an aspirational report . #% I have seen at first hand the continual bombings of the north-south railway lines over the past 30 years due to the Troubles . #% Finally , I should like very briefly to quote the following : ' Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day , teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% It also questions the precautionary principle , on the grounds that this principle would seem to make it more difficult for aquaculture ventures . #% 
Due legal process is the sometimes long-winded tool for attaining justice . #% When we come here and complain about fraud in the area of Community spending we get satisfaction , figures and action , but never in the area of fishing . #% We must work towards a more progressive system in which workers are entitled to keep as much of their earned income as possible and there is better provision of services in the social sphere in areas such as housing , health and education through the national exchequer . #% My understanding is that the study in the Lancet magazine referring to dangers for pregnant women living near landfill sites refers to sites where hazardous and toxic waste - not normal waste - is being dumped . #% We have avoided over-regulation and excessive bureaucracy and come forward with a piece of legislation that is reasonable and workable and which protects workers . #% Mr President , this first reading on the budget is a defining moment but , as we know , it is not yet the definitive moment in identifying and setting our priorities for 1997 . #% We can not undermine this policy in order to create or finance another objective . #% I also wish to warmly welcome to our Parliament the Speaker of the Knesset , Mr Avraham Burg , and the President of the Palestinian Legislative Council , Mr Ahmed Qurie . #% Madam President , I voted against this resolution . #% I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi . #% The positive approach of a traditionally neutral country such as Austria to these developments is to be applauded and I urge all other neutral Member States , including my own , to follow their lead . #% The changing nature of the market with more power generators opting for gas rather than coal to produce electricity has increased the pressure on governments to reduce the user threshold . #% Sometimes it is national authorities who are actually flouting the law and behaving in an utterly negligent way . #% European Union taxpayers no longer want to see films on television documenting the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals . #% The rate of animal death in the area was so alarming that it sparked an investigation a number of years ago , which documented unprecedented animal deaths . #% I believe it is possible . #% Therefore I gladly support the proposal before us today . #% By its nature what he has done is straightforward and millions of people do exactly what he has done . #% It is all very well to complain about it , but we have to ask the question ` why ' ? #% While I agree with many of the points made by the Commissioner , we have to be realistic about these matters . #% The Commissioner forces the banks in our country to resolve his problem of too much tonnage in EU waters by driving our Irish fishing fleet into bankruptcy . #% However , you must resist the temptation to let things stagnate until then . #% There was a hysterical press interest , not in what was happening in the discussions , but in what was happening on the streets , which was largely due to complete clumsiness by the local police . #% Mr President , my oral amendment is to avoid ambiguity in recital C. I propose to insert the word ` unfortunately ' between the word ` whereas ' and ` Somalia ' and to replace the words ` with a view to restoring order ' with the words ` with a view to taking charge ' . #% As has already been mentioned , this has been adopted by this Parliament ; this Parliament itself operates by it and the Council operates by it . #% She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment at a secret trial . #% The issue of habeas corpus is also in danger here - the guarantee of safety while somebody is in custody . #% If we need that money to run our country -- and that is a matter for our national government -- it must still be collected from the motoring public . #% While I fully endorse giving priority to setting up units to provide palliative care for the terminally ill , so that they can die with dignity , I believe that the sensitive question of euthanasia is not one that should be dealt with by the European Parliament . #% On top of that , there is the fact that Mr Barroso came to us as the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe to put his case in each of our groups . #% Madam President , I think that , as has already been mentioned here tonight , the key is to have women in decision-making roles and in positions of power . #% The best definition to date of the precautionary approach is the one contained in the UN fish stocks agreement , and many of these and other principles are defined there . #% However , the human population explosion , combined with an expanding urban -- and world -- market system , has changed this . #% Child-labour-free does not only mean that there is no child labour being used in the parent company or even by its immediate suppliers : a company at the top of the supply chain must have the responsibility to ensure that all steps of , and conduits to , the supply chain are child-labour-free . #% For example , our waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs and human beings . #% The world is a much smaller place now that we are living through the biggest revolution in the history of the world in terms of technology , telecommunications and transport . #% The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward . #% However , the proposal to establish a single budget line could simplify the work of the European Parliament as a whole and increase transparency . #% This is a packet of Viagra , now available over the Internet . #% We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union . #% Ill health as a result of obesity is costing taxpayers millions of euro each year and exerting extreme pressure on health services . #% Now is the time for this to happen . #% A lot of vessels are used for transporting live animals . #% It is up to the British government to make a statement on these matters . #% I could not look my constituents in the eye , some who will undoubtedly lose their jobs as a result of cuts in UK spending , and say that MEPs spent even more of their money wisely - and remember it is their money - by boosting the coffers of the EEAS , Europol and regulation of financial services . #% That is the kind of success that can be achieved by the Committee on Petitions and we need more resources if the Committee on Petitions is to do its work effectively . #% This agreement with the European Commission provides only for voluntary registration , even though lobbyists not included in the joint register will no longer be able to obtain a long-term access badge to the European Parliament . #% I appreciate that you actually understand the demands and needs of the ordinary people . #% It is not a very generous outlay of money , but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best , then the money can be usefully spent . #% As a result of five increases , export refunds on skimmed milk have risen from EUR 0 to 650 per tonne . #% I fear that will be impossible if we do not implement adequate vocational training systems geared towards concerned groups of the inshore fisheries population , not least the development of marketing skills . #% Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today , Commissioner Wallström , that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on . #% More than 30 % of the traffic into Dublin is in transit and it is time to take a firm political decision to sort out the transport problems once and for all . #% We know that there are ground-to-air missiles at Cap de la Hague , and the defences of Sellafield remain a secret . #% Consumer confidence in beef is at an all-time low , and consumers expect and deserve better from us . #% This should be protected and maintained at all times . #% EU environmental and food safety laws can form a safety net between farming and the World Trade Organisation . #% In the short time available , I appeal to the Commission and , indeed , Parliament to urgently expedite the conclusions necessary to allay consumer fears concerning the public health , environmental and ethical aspects of a technology which has the potential to make a significant contribution to food production and public health . #% The Irish Sea -- the narrow strip of water that separates us from Sellafield -- has , because of Sellafield , become the most radioactive body of water in the world . #% Nearly EUR 44.8 billion is due to be allocated to the common agricultural policy next year and I very much welcome the support that the European Union is giving to agriculture in general . #% If I could say one last thing , it seems to me it would be very useful if we did this next September and completed the debate by December and that you , Madam President , as President of this institution , and Mr Prodi , as President of the European Commission , could go to the European Council and tell them ex ante : this is our priority for Europe . #% I admire a man who is willing to say that he may have made mistakes in the past but now we are moving forward . #% I thank you for the honour you bring to our country in that regard . #% We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them . #% That is why the Commission must set in train open procedures to transmit up-to-date information on the whole range of regulations , directives and international accords being discussed and enacted by the Union . #% This year , it has announced that it will not reach that figure , not because we do not have the money , but because the Government wants to spend the money on winning the next election ! #% 
This is an ever-changing situation and the inherent dangers are very great . #% Is this what you really want ? #% The Agreement is a vital tool in ensuring that the EU is well equipped to combat illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing in our waters . #% The testing of all animals over 30 months and the removal of specified risk material should go a long way in restoring consumer confidence . #% The Commission , the Committee on Fisheries and the Council all claim to agree with the precautionary approach , which states that the absence of definite proof should not be used to refuse action to prevent a decline in fish stocks . #% The creation of a European company has long been seen as essential to a comprehensive body of European company law which promotes business . #% We know it generally deals with major infrastructure projects where levels of security are very high and each project 's timescale is measured over many years . #% Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy . #% I am currently preparing a formal complaint to the Irish Police based on the findings of the Goldstone report , to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider the case for prosecutions in Ireland of those responsible . #% Firstly , let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East . #% URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK , in Moss Side . #% I have sent in letters on the subject . #% The preparation process has been a detailed one . #% Indeed , often , women from less developed countries come to the EU and work in low skilled jobs , or even illegal employment . #% We would like to see the new Member States come in under the same conditions as those offered to Ireland . #% His job has , in many ways , brought the citizens of Europe closer to us , an aspiration we continually speak about here in Parliament . #% Mr Simpson is perhaps the person we know best . #% In all , more than 30 billion television viewers are expected to watch the World Cup that has just started . #% Leadership : you have to show willpower , integrity and you have to show that you have very good eyes and ears and that you are a competent person . #% Furthermore , the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force under the Amsterdam Treaty has worried some people that it will bring to an end Ireland 's military neutrality . #% As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration . #% Secondly , throughout Europe , but especially in Ireland , there is a trend of building on flood plains . #% The repealing of four labour laws on 16 July by the Provisional Legislative Council was also discussed . #% I state categorically that even today the topic of this report is on websites in Ireland and is being used by the `` no to Nice '' campaign to beat around the ears those like myself who would be part of the `` yes '' campaign in relation to the Nice Treaty . #% I believe that the major decisions that have been made in respect of enlargement , reform and defence show that there is a sustained vitality in our common European vocation . #% We have no competence in this Parliament . #% There is a welcome to them here in the European Parliament . #% Let me finish by saying this : we need to be cautious as to how we reform our agriculture policy . #% This will be the last time that we will ask the EU for funding for this programme , as the International Fund will cease in 2010 . #% This is just one more example of the grave human rights situation in Northern Ireland . #% The European Union is an evolving Union , it will only evolve as far as the Treaties allow it to evolve . #% In creating more and better quality jobs in Europe , we must implement a broad-ranging set of policies at EU level . #% Domestic violence against women and children is clearly a crime and I strongly support amendments that have highlighted that . #% I have a few points . #% That not only means improving safety standards of production within the Union but also tightening up rules and conditions for the importation of food products into the Union . #% Education , health , transport and other frontline services have all seen their funding slashed across the EU . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% If that were the case , they would not need ratification from all 15 Member States . #% That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements - and that is a very real difference . #% We are all aware that the levels of violence have dangerously escalated and that the excessive and disproportionate use of force has resulted in the deaths of many innocent civilians . #% I have been here for the last 16 years and I am at least entitled to the respect of the House . #% Terrorism deliberately sets out to destroy freedom : its purpose is to destroy freedom . #% There is a lesson to be learned here and greater transparency is needed in future . #% Europe has such rich and varied produce and food , and we certainly need to protect that from trade liberalisation absolutists . #% In the Doha Development Round , the plan should be about justice and ending poverty , but it seems to be more about dismantling things to make way for the big players , about getting rid of small producers , who are inefficient , democratic and difficult to control and have inconvenient notions as regards lifestyles , and about assigning each area and each country a specialty in which to work efficiently without bothering anyone . #% The European Central Bank is satisfied that the requisite amount of the new euro notes will be dispersed to financial institutions in non-Euro zone countries . #% The Irish also had further concerns in relation to domestic support , the redemption of the ` bluebox ' and the exemption from reduction commitments of direct payments which are of vital importance to our farmers . #% Moreover , armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit , at times forcibly , child combatants . #% It is important that business is clear about its obligations to provide information on promotions . #% While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups , which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watchdogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf , I would urge caution in allowing any self-legitimising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clog up an already overburdened justice system . #% Who will give us the right to speak on behalf of all of those people if we use our time and energy trying to get one over on a neo-Liberal , neo-Conservative , Communist -- or whatever -- approach ? #% It is something that we can all support . #% However , it soon became obvious - and I should like to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri for her work on this project - that we are fighting a rearguard action against the passionate affair which some Commissioners are conducting with the new sexy electronic media to the detriment - for those of us who are passionate readers , as I am sure many are in the House - of the printed word . #% In Europe we have difficulties concerning the operation of the Stability and Growth Pact , but we must work through them with a sense of purpose and determination . #% There is nothing they do not want to know but there has to be a limit put by society on that curiosity . #% Could you also address the implications of this for the cross-border healthcare package which is currently under discussion ? #% Therefore , my Group , although it supports the two reports , wants a lot more from you , Commissioner , and from our Member States . #% Concentration of media ownership means that enhancing the business interests of an elite minority can be disguised as independent editorial . #% There are clearly circumstances relating to the island of Ireland and the isolated position of Greece as far as railways are concerned which require to be taken into account . #% I am asking him today if he is prepared to at least put that item on the agenda for consideration by the Council so that the matter can be progressed . #% I am sure he will be aware of efforts to reach agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy in advance of the World Trade Agreement and the June deadline , which the committee has set . #% In Ireland groundwater and aquifers provide one quarter of our drinking water . #% However , it has not been signed by any Member State , nor by the Community . #% This certainly applies to my country as well as France and I think to Germany and every other country . #% In one case , I see the public taxpayer in a Member State being forced to pay through the clearance of accounts for the crimes of individual companies . #% Thank you , John . #% 
We can not continue to accept this situation . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on his first day and hope his response to us today on the International Criminal Court is a reflection of his future cooperation with this House . #% I too would like to welcome the fact that you have come to this House to dialogue with us before you go to your summit meeting . #% in writing . - Small businesses are the backbone of the European economy , accounting for 98 % of all European businesses and employing up to 60 % of the EU 's workers . #% We need to ensure that the impact of any future directive furthers rather than fragments the internal market as Member States interpret , implement or enforce such a directive to fit in with their own different national approaches . #% Particular reference has been made to the importance of different bodies in the Commission working closely together in the cultural field in order to pull the strings together . #% Right now , I am most concerned about the level to which this House is being kept informed of negotiations . #% This report has all the integrity that is expected of this Parliament . #% It is obvious that Britain 's first outbreak originated outside the Community , and I now question whether third countries which export to us are complying with the conditions we have imposed . #% There is a lot of ingenuity , they are perfectly wrapped , perfectly presented and perfectly labelled . #% I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date . #% It is only right and proper that he answers to the Serbian people for crimes he has committed against them and in their name . #% For our part , the Liberal group has consistently argued the merits of individual accountability within collegiality . #% We want legal certainty . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by saying how much I welcome this debate and I congratulate the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy on its initiative . #% This will be important to us . #% The message to the public with regard to biotechnology must be balanced and devoid of emotion , unlike much of what has happened so far in the area of biotechnological research . #% The only reason there were so many children going to the school was because they were given food donated by the European Union and the World Food Programme . #% This process will be furthered , not diminished , by the enlargement of the Union . #% As has already been said , it was supported unanimously in committee . #% Much advertising goes well beyond the erotic to the pornographic with overtones of violence and sadism . #% The measures included in this report will also ensure that polluters face similar requirements , and penalties , right across the European Union . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I think it is important for us to have this discussion in the light of the upcoming adoption of an ILO Convention on Domestic Workers . #% In the short time available , I want to add my voice to that of those in this Parliament who insist on greater protection of Europe ' s vital interests in the forthcoming world trade talks . #% The main aim of the Cohesion Fund was to help countries with the greatest structural disadvantages ; the beneficiaries of the Fund having a per capita GNP lower than 90 % of the Community average and committing to adopt a convergence programme . #% Parliament has to be involved in this better regulation agenda and must have the right as co-legislator to ensure that the expert laws voted through this House can be scrutinised and monitored . #% These negotiations should not detract from one particular fact , namely that the enlargement of the Union will take place on 1 May 2004 . #% The scope of the register covers many activities carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the policy formulation or implementation and decision-making processes of the European institutions . #% Finally , could I point very briefly to where we should go in the future . #% The European Union could therefore play a major role in ensuring there will be no conflict or war in the world . #% Therefore , I ask Council to take on board those issues in the Industry Council on 7 May . #% However the willingness of the Paris Club to act in this case begs the question whether debt relief decisions are being made on the basis of need or that of US political imperatives ? #% I have to say I am angry at how some of our citizens treat these strangers . #% I have met many of them and have experienced at first hand their resourcefulness and dedication . #% Therefore I appeal to you to show common sense and return to the drawing-board . #% We can not continue to export our problems . #% The percentage of women elected to the Member States ' national parliaments varies between 45 % and 9 % . #% I find it a discourtesy to colleagues . #% The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today . #% As I said on a previous occasion we should not play God with research . #% I am pleased to say that all the ideas contained in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry have been included in the report in one form or another . #% One of the most important issues -- brought up by all speakers in this House today -- has been the investment in human capital : the issue of training , education and the way in which that leads to further research , and future innovation and development . #% This Task Force seeks to promote greater flexibility in education , training and innovation , encourages greater flexibility on the part of workers and companies , and removes disincentives to employment . #% But as these facts have only recently come to light , it seems unlikely that the study can look very closely at the issue and I would like an assurance from you that it will be seriously followed up . #% It seems to me that there is a huge amount of support for substitution , while only the PVC industry is reluctant . #% We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed . #% In its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision - and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field . #% They argue that human cloning is about the promotion of health . #% I do not agree with my Irish colleague , Mr Hyland , that it is in anybody ' s interest to produce something for destruction . #% Neither is an adequate solution . #% I would ask you as a very respected senior Vice-President of this House and present President-in-Office : would you have the security services remove from outside the doorway ? #% In this regard some GBP 230 million have been provided for on-farm investment under the National Development Plan . #% I am therefore calling for the introduction of a `` Carbon Labelling '' system , which would give consumers the information to make responsible and wise choices . #% We should have the courage of our convictions and I hope that the Commissioner would respond positively to the proposal that there should be an office in Taiwan sooner rather than later . #% With such a model , the quality of the test can be very high , which makes it very difficult and very expensive for young people to get , and yet no one looks at the skills of a driver 20 years on . #% However , there must be punishment for those crimes for someone at some stage . #% We have gone to the edge of the precipice but we have not gone over . #% I want to pay tribute to them and all the workers who put together this wonderful building . #% I urge the European Commission to act promptly on foot of this report and meet the demands of this democratically elected Parliament to bring forward appropriate measures . #% Investment in a clean environment in Ireland will , in the medium to long-term , justify the additional expenditure . #% The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor . #% But it is very clear that that alone will not be enough . #% It has produced a detailed study on the costs of non-social Europe which concluded that , while the so-called costs of social policy are usually immediately visible , the benefits are more difficult to identify and quantify . #% This is the fourth attempt . #% Another problem with the management of the MAGPs by the Commission relates to the waters beyond the European Union . #% That makes it impossible for Members to be here . #% 
She is much loved throughout Europe . #% The one thing we can say for certain is that the present common fisheries policy is not one of the best-loved policies of the Union , and there is certainly no guarantee that future changes will endear any future policy to the industry , especially given the pressure on fish stocks and the differing views of scientists and fishermen . #% There is a need for phosphate-free detergents . #% Back in the 1960s in the European Court of Justice , the primacy of European law over national law was brought into being . #% This should be reduced gradually . #% Again , I agree with the Commissioner . #% We wonder how the Commission would propose to try to induce the Council , with its Article 99 privileges , to do that , and not simply to take more tax and ignore the labour taxation . #% We will be better informed . #% To do this would be to offer some sort of an incentive to those countries not to participate in monetary union if they have strong currencies and are eligible to do so . #% If the quotas are being observed , surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels . #% Perhaps you could enlighten us with the legal expertise at your disposal . #% That must be spelled out also so that we do not panic the consumer into thinking that the disease is continuing to spread . #% Clearly , however , SOLVIT needs more resources and support , and needs to promote itself and its availability to the public . #% I would suggest that Europol would be a very appropriate place to have this centralized agency capable of responding within 24 hours . #% We can probably do something to recompense that , but you can not give back a life . #% This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement . #% I was assured personally last night by Commissioner Verheugen , the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice-President of the Commission , that -- and I quote him with his permission : ` If the new regulation enters into force , I will propose to the Commission to withdraw the infringement procedures against Austria and Denmark . ' #% Therefore , whilst it is important that each of us must stand up for the inalienable freedoms and rights enjoyed by each individual citizen , as well as by groups of citizens , I think there is a better way to deal with this problem than through a Charter , namely through the incorporation of the Convention into European Union law and its enforcement at national Member State level . #% Similarly , enlargement will also generate additional road transport . #% Unlike the Spanish and Italian governments , Irish citizens are not being selfish about the effects of enlargement on our future share of structural and cohesion funding . #% I admire the way that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has engaged with Northern Ireland . #% The critical question in Ireland is this : why did those who would normally have voted `` yes '' stay at home ? #% For social reasons we need to make an investment and I am glad to hear accompanying measures being spoken about . #% I want to lobby unashamedly for the European anti-poverty network . #% We must have improved scientific information : there can be no broad-brush approach , as has been said . #% The current development round at the WTO is supposed to give special attention to the needs of developing countries and their desire to better integrate themselves into the global trading system . #% There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban . #% The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point . #% Finally , we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today . #% In my own country gang warfare , intimidation and shootings are becoming all too frequent an occurrence , particularly in my own constituency . #% The great danger now is that the further we get away from the terrible events of 30 January , the more likely that this -- like so many other murders of innocent people in Northern Ireland over the last 35 years -- will go unsolved and will be forgotten about . #% It is certainly something which needs to be attended to , in my view . #% There are many challenges ahead . #% Policies will have to be developed which are capable of generating economic growth and new jobs for the millions of unemployed ; of tackling international crime and drug smuggling ; of settling the difficult question of the future funding of Europe from the year 2000 onwards and of moving forward with the single currency project . #% While the number of incidents proportionate to the volume of quality food produced is minimal , the negative impact on consumers is considerable . #% The food scares experienced in recent years must never again be allowed to reach proportions which threaten European consumers , farmers and the agrifood industry . #% In the life of the current Parliament we have agreed a whole new regulatory environment for the sector , and that is something of which this House , and of course Commissioner Byrne , can be justly proud . #% In relation to the accession reports on the individual states , I have grave concern about the emphasis on the common foreign and security aspect , the fact that countries are being coerced into joining Nato . #% They make up the largest workforce in Europe ; they often lift beyond their weight and work around the clock , year in and year out . #% For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama . #% It is with great pleasure that I commend this resolution to the House . #% But what use will all this valuable work be if , concurrently , we allow GM to infiltrate our crops , and thus our food and produce ? #% I want to ask you , Madam President , if you would ask somebody from the Commission or one of the Commissioners to come here to address Parliament and say what exactly we are doing to stop the terrible brutality taking place in Chechnya . #% In essence we need an integrated approach , not a piecemeal one ; an approach that binds together and builds up existing programmes and policy initiatives in order to create a more effective whole . #% I also wish to congratulate the Swedish presidency on putting the notion of conflict prevention on the agenda in a much stronger way than up to now . #% When the incoming Presidency sets out its programme , it can often sound a little stale or bored and the reaction to it is also stale . #% In the last 18 months , 34 countries have reported outbreaks . #% I am referring to the US-Mexico City policy of requiring that NGOs agree , as a condition of receiving US funds , that they should neither perform nor promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations . #% While there is a debate on the ethics about how animals are being fed , it must be borne in mind that the alternatives sometimes pose even bigger ethical questions . #% Finally , on the issue of third country nationals , we have a major problem throughout the European Union with this ` Fortress Europe ' mentality , keeping out the so-called non-desirables : non-whites , non-westerners or non-Christians . #% ( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution ) Joint motion for a resolution on the closure of Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000 and completion of Khmelnitsky and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine #% Mr President , it is a disgrace at this vital time in the history of Europe that a shadow lies over the Commission . #% Mr President , the notion of EU citizenship is really a synthetic concoction ; it is not a natural product . #% Finally on Nice - on après-Nice - just to make a point . #% Mr President , the Commission 's approach to this whole issue is totally inadequate . #% Unless we in the European Union actually ensure that these kinds of measures are protected , we can not push for any other oppressive legislation . #% But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses -- not just in Burundi , but in so many other parts of the world . #% The principle of progressive access regarding two-wheeled vehicles would surely improve safety . #% It is even more difficult when there are no support mechanisms to help the industry find a way forward . #% It is our responsibility to provide them with the information to make this choice . #% It has become well documented that if people do not start smoking before the age of 18 the chances are that they will not become smokers at all in later life . #% The review must be undertaken by the European Parliament in cooperation with the Ombudsman 's office and I hope that we can get review under way quite soon . #% The motion calls on the authorities of all three countries to make progress in specific areas . #% The Irish Government too has a right and duty to defend its policy preferences , where it feels it is right to do so . #% However , I also believe that this was a provocative act by ` Women on Waves ' and an attempt to undermine the principle of subsidiarity because , while in this House we may or may not agree with Portugal 's stance on abortion , we must at all times recognise its right as a democratically elected government to make these decisions . #% We have to talk about social issues , culture and what concerns people in their daily lives . #% 
The enlargement process itself is essentially a political process and we must not lose sight of that , notwithstanding the many technical dimensions that attend it . #% Domestic work - family caring , for example - takes place exclusively in the family home . #% He has a point and a minority of people in this Parliament agree with that . #% I support the call for an international inquiry into the possible use by Israeli forces of weapons of mass destruction , as was suspected in Lebanon . #% Who will speak for the downtrodden and the oppressed ? #% It seems to me that equating that with a loss of EUR 14 million is a gross exaggeration . #% Yet , the Irish Department of Agriculture is at this very moment debarring applicants from the EU 's early retirement scheme for farmers if they are found to have been engaged in part-time work for a period prior to their application . #% In this respect the role of the European Safety Agency needs to be increased in checking international standards and issuing certificates of approval . #% May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry . #% The appropriate financial resources must be made available to facilitate this process . #% It is really an important issue and , unless the Commission deals with it as a matter of priority , we are going to see a deepening crisis in Europe . #% If I were to arrange a round table with the industry - with dealers and manufacturers - would you be willing to come along to it and discuss with them how we can find a way through the problem while , at the same time , resorting to competition instruments if we have to ? #% It would be wrong to give in to attempts to demonise GM foods and feedstuffs . #% If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment , which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment , it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended . #% I want to begin by asking the Commissioner to indicate very clearly what the Commission 's views are on this debate , on the amendments and on what has happened in the various committees . #% Decentralised management is most welcome as we all wish to see a less cumbersome and bureaucratic approach to the running of European programmes and drawing down of funds . #% We know that there is a fairly high rate of road accidents as a result of truck drivers who are driving hours too long . #% The Commission 's communication on the future of health care and care for the elderly , focusing on accessibility , quality and financial viability , provides a useful framework for policy exchange regarding the challenges that all Member States are facing in this area . #% It will do more than all the talking and directives and transposition into national law . #% However , I want to focus this debate on a flagrant breach of human rights perpetuated within this European Union specifically within the United Kingdom . #% They have each in their own way showed enormous courage . #% This is why I welcome this communication , which seeks to put in place procedures to deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes . #% It is essential , as Commissioner McCreevy stated , that we deliver a better Services Directive which will unleash the enormous economic potential of the services sector in Europe . #% I welcome the chance to improve the survival chances and financial prospects of UK small companies and also to contribute to the overall competitiveness of the EU in boosting job creation . #% This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated . #% That is why I believe that this proposal - which I support - gives hope to the people who live in these remote communities , where no other hope exists for them and no one seems to want to help . #% in writing . - It is clear that mercury is a substance that needs to be dealt with in a cautious and secure manner . #% I have experienced this in my everyday life ; I have seen cases in which companies and individuals have been found guilty of abusing Community funds . #% Cattle breeds are different because the gene pool to which they belong has been modified through selection for certain characteristics . #% It is an important confirmation by Parliament that Nice is necessary to facilitate a successful enlargement process . #% The statement on the Pakistan election showed little commitment to this . #% I hope the Commission will be able to take on board the very positive aspect that I have put forward in my amendment . #% This means that a total of EUR 1,850 million will be made available over the seven year period of the new programme . #% As you know , Commissioner , there is information that these weapons are coming from European Union Member States and it seems immoral that this should be allowed to continue . #% The figure is now 5.35 % . #% However , it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete . #% This is a very important aspect that should be transferred to agreements with ACP countries as it is much more equitable . #% If such a delegation were to come from this House , would the presidency receive it affirmatively ? #% We often hear in this House that European citizens somehow feel far removed from decisions taken at European level , that the issues dealt with are not ones that impinge on their daily lives . #% But the support of other Member States is being put at risk by the ban imposed by the government yesterday or the day before on imports of bone-in beef and lamb , and also the failure by the authorities in Britain to keep the ports open , as is required by the operation of the single market . #% in writing . - Mrs Niebler has presented the report on renewal of the existing agreement between the EC and Russia on cooperation in science and technology . #% It is even worse that EU governments fail to practice what they preach . #% We have to be pragmatic about this . #% Such an assessment should also be evaluated by the European Commission . #% For the first time the European regulatory framework for authentication services will be established and the legal recognition of electronic signatures ensured . #% However , I would be grateful , in case similar incidents should occur , which they undoubtedly will , if you could contact both the Commission and the Council of Ministers , representing the Member States , so that appropriate measures can be put in place and so that both airlines and national health authorities know what to do if someone they suspect of being gravely ill is on board one of their planes . #% I thank Mrs Green for that explanation . #% Clubs in my region are concerned that the money they invest in buying players will not give them a return on their investment and , as Mr Cushnahan said , they will not be interested in running football academies and in investing in the local community if they can not see a return on their investment . #% I think we should all get a clap on the back . #% Aquaculture has considerable potential to support further growth in much needed jobs and economic activity , notably in coastal communities where other jobs are very hard to find . #% This is a very sensible option . #% Would the Commissioner be in a position to say whether there is universal support for the ratification of the 1996 Hague Convention ? #% The waste is shipped through the Irish Sea , thus making it the most radioactive body of water in the world . #% Mr President , when we consider the historic , colonial interference of many European countries in various places around the world , for example Burundi , it is very important that we have this discussion here today on Burundi where government forces have been responsible for extra-judicial killings , disappearances , torture and other serious violations . #% Madam President , I too had not intended to take the floor , but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters of an hour . #% The most immediate objective for the 15 existing Members of the European Union is to ensure that the Treaty of Nice is ratified across the Union as soon as possible . #% Mr President , I commend the two rapporteurs and agree with what has already been said here tonight . #% The British Nuclear Fuel 's vessel named Pacific Swan is rapidly becoming the pariah of South America because the captain intends to negotiate the treacherous waters of Cape Horn with 90 tonnes of waste vitrified in 192 glass blocks . #% Further steps can be taken to solidify this in the future , which is much needed as far as investment and , indeed , research and development is concerned . #% Consistency and the rate of implementation need to be improved if the Lisbon objectives and the challenges of globalisation are realistically to be met . #% If epilepsy is not treated , people suffer more deeply than when there is adequate treatment . #% If this is the case does that mean that anyone , anywhere , can be stopped ? #% The report tries to make much of Article 2 of the Framework Agreement , but the flaw therein is that while it bestows on the Commission President the obligation to identify and act upon conflicts of interests affecting Commissioners , nothing is put in place to identify and act upon such conflicts affecting the President himself . #% Many of the amendments adopted in committee would place the European agriculture industry at a considerable disadvantage vis-à-vis our trading partners , not to mention running the risk of falling foul of our WTO commitments . #% Secondly , the new disclosures requirements on lawyers , I believe , would seriously undermine the long established precedent of lawyer/client confidentiality . #% To assist , a UK Government scheme of grant aid was announced , with applications possible until the end of this month . #% 
Statistics show that the overall drop in crime is around 5 % and that the police have significantly reduced gang-related crime involving the gambling industry . #% in writing . - I wish to express support for this report and its recommendations . #% It is clear from the ethnic subjugation in the past few months that Milosevic has nothing but contempt for our studied , nuanced and impotent words of diplomacy . #% In the end I decided to support it , but I have major problems because the expenses issue is not separated from the salaries issue . #% We need political will -- which does not exist and is unlikely to exist -- within the European Union to avoid a repeat of the disaster . #% Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality , rural development , environment protection and animal welfare . #% in writing . - I strongly support this report as another step in the building of real European political parties which can act on a pan-European basis . #% Next week 's European summit must concentrate on defusing the tensions which have been allowed to build up in recent weeks between the British Government and its European partners . #% Mr President , I welcome the European Union initiative in January to break the current WTO deadlock on developing countries ' access to affordable medicines , particularly those countries which do not have the manufacturing capacity to make generic medicines locally . #% The question we have to ask is : what can Europe do to provide an effective response to the need to protect our children from violence , abductions , paedophile rings , Internet abuse and other exploitation ? #% The Ombudsman very correctly ensures that all of those complaints are redirected to those bodies which can provide some redress for citizens , whether that is the Petitions Committee , the national Ombudsman offices , or other national institutions . #% That Treaty retained the principle of a common agricultural policy agreed in 1957 , including the article which states that EU policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community , in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture . #% In my own country of Ireland , we have one of the lowest ratios of neurologists to patients : 17 , where we should have a minimum of 39 , a fact that negatively affects the outcome for Irish patients . #% The idea that people as young as 14 are to be fingerprinted is completely unacceptable . #% We would like to check that there is to be a separate vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 39 as a block and on Amendments Nos 80 , 102 , 122 , 127 and 128 . #% Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing . #% I particularly want to see moves in this area in view of the newly-relaunched rural development pillar . #% The talks with South Africa have been going on for over three years now and I would call to mind the commitment we have entered into to conclude the EU/South Africa agreement by March at the latest . #% The impact of domestic and physical and/or sexual violence should not be underestimated , as it results in severe damage to individuals ' physical and mental health giving rise to severe depression and even suicide . #% Irish investment in wind energy will only pay off , for example , if there is European infrastructure to export that energy via the UK and France . #% 50 000 such packets were seized at a house in Oldham . #% They have failed to do so up to now . #% Does he think that this policy needs to be reviewed and that an individual regulation to suit each Member State is required in the spending of structural funds ? #% In conclusion , you can have all the regulation in the world , but if there is not a committed individual watching and guiding for all the Member States , it will amount to nothing . #% Its implementation was a momentous , historic development , representing the largest quantum leap towards political union . #% I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner . #% If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs . #% These are the problems that are swaying the balance between life and death for Haitians . #% Finally , this motion supports the UNHCR and calls on the Commission to establish a closer partnership with the UNHCR by offering both political and financial support to assist them in their office in Cairo in order to work more closely with the Egyptian authorities to find lasting solutions to the difficult situation of Sudanese migrants and refugees in Egypt . #% in writing . - Due to a conflict of interest , I abstained from all votes . #% But the important point is that this is a subsidiarity issue and we must give no indication that it is otherwise . #% Look at the century we have just left . #% It is important that the European Parliament and the Commission are seen to be serving the public of Europe . #% The European Union must also implement the Financial Services Action Plan by the end of next year . #% Why should 5 % prevent the 95 % progress that could be made ? #% The UK gets 40 % of all foreign investment which comes into the European Union . #% Furthermore the sector must deliver on best practice from a food safety perspective and here I disagree with my Irish colleague Mrs McKenna . #% Mr President , there are big problems with the Members ' Statute . #% I would press the Commissioner to send one of his officials to Northern Ireland immediately to assess for himself the tragedy and gravity of the situation . #% I would like to see private operators exempted from the scope of this directive . #% I do not believe that the troops in Iraq can oversee the peacekeeping efforts in that country . #% The budget for next year is going to have to take account of these commitments . #% There must be fair fishing grounds with all parties committed and forced to comply with the rules . #% I welcome the new Commission 's commitment to continuing this fund which provides people with a ` hand up ' as opposed to a ` hand out ' following redundancy . #% I would just point out one factor alone : that in the new buildings we have in Brussels it is impossible for a person in a wheelchair to move from the B block to the C block or from the B block to the A block , because the passageways are too narrow . #% At the same time , we must be true to our values in relation to respect for human rights and try to get the balance right . #% We had the widest grasp of any committee . #% The issue of social exclusion is a matter to which the presidency attaches a high priority . #% However , not everyone has access to this knowledge base . #% I do not agree with the German agricultural minister 's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified . #% More R [ amp ] D is needed to tailor selectivity devices such as square mesh panels and sorting grids to make them even more effective in protecting young fish . #% But above and beyond that it is recognised that you are a man of strong conviction with many natural human qualities ; a person of great energy and determination and a person who has always been positive and even-handed ; a person who is encouraging and indeed , a person who can be very firm and authoritative when that sort of authority needs to be shown , as we have witnessed on occasion . #% I condemn that duplicity , I condemn that hypocrisy but most of all I call on the Dublin Government to end the shame and to return these fugitives forthwith . #% Livestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community . #% Except the US and Somalia , all countries in the world have ratified the Convention ; but despite the fact that the EU Member States have ratified it too , the EU institutions themselves have so far failed to implement it . #% It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and , frankly , the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for . #% One amendment I have difficulty with is the proposal to reduce NOx emission limits from 650 to 200 . #% Indeed , such a proposal could even undermine existing consumer rights . #% When we eventually have true equality there will be no need for positive discrimination . #% As I have already stated in this House this morning , the people I represent especially have no confidence in Commissioner Patten . #% The European Union Social Fund is a key financial mechanism which has been used very effectively , particularly in Objective 1 regions , to provide new training opportunities for the unskilled . #% In its initial communication , the eight biophysical criteria proposed by the Commission to assess the classification of areas with significant natural handicaps were undoubtedly biased towards the warmer and drier climates of continental Europe . #% I believe the Structural Funds have a very different objective to state aid and I would simply refer to the case of rural areas . #% Let us assume our responsibilities as a House in the area where we have the complete authority to do so and let us vote in the order indicated . #% The oral question this morning raises an excellent point about the hypocrisy and inequity of the Western world demanding materials for vaccines from developing countries to protect their rich citizens , and then having the audacity to sell the selfsame vaccines back to the poor . #% I would urge the Commission again to examine the possibilities and its policy in relation to food aid . #% 
I come from a country , Ireland , which in some ways is out of step with the major demographic trends evident in other EU Member States . #% I welcome the compromise reached and support the provisions relating to the possible lifting of the feed ban , because the provision is based on sound science . #% Because of the problems of unemployment , in particular long-term unemployment across Europe , we must have preventative as well as curative measures for the long-term unemployed . #% Mr President , before I address the subject of today 's debate , it is important that I record in this House the fact that the Irish sugar industry will cease production totally . #% I would ask you to study that in full also , Mrs de Palacio . #% The Palestinian leadership has been presented with a list of security messages by the United States Government that will have to be implemented . #% Remember , colleagues , that using sugar as raw material , Brazil is the world 's ethanol superpower , with an interesting ownership of the sector -- not all Brazilian . #% I accept that Ecofin endorsed the judgment of the Commission . #% Madam President , one thing that makes my heart very glad is to hear the last unreconstructed Tory of the seventeenth century agree at last that freedom is a good thing for Ireland . #% I am therefore deeply disappointed at the negative attitude of the Council of Ministers which can not even be bothered to get a proper legal base for the SAVE II programme . #% There is no place for dissidence at this critical time and those found in breach of the regulations should , in my view , be severely censured . #% I am therefore sickened that anybody should expect that their republicanism can be used as an excuse for violent and despicable acts of murder , particularly in the case of Robert McCartney . #% For these conventions to be effective the implementation of the procedures must be extremely rapid and almost automatic . #% Ten years ago , who would have believed there would be such an expansion in information technology services . #% Yes , people come to this committee with problems that we very often can not solve , but at least they have a port to call on and , where cases are inadmissible , we try to redirect . #% Mr President , while the resolution is correct and proper , it has omitted to include Ireland . #% A recent EU Fundamental Rights Agency report concludes that ` The amendments could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of , or information about , homosexuality ' . #% Mr President , I intended to vote against , instead of for , Amendment No 4 to the Arias Cañete report . #% It is doing the fishing industry no favours in the long term if this is the kind of simplistic , nationalistic short-term approach that has been taken . #% However , after the report was debated and voted on in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , there was an outbreak of the acute respiratory disease , SARS . #% In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today . #% On 18 May , there will be protests around the world organised by many groups , including the Tamil Solidarity Campaign , to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war . #% Mr President , I am pleased indeed that Commissioners Lamy and Fischler will be going to Tokyo for the mini-ministerial with an approved position . #% The European Union is the biggest aid donor in the world , donating 60 % of aid , and we are probably the biggest donor of humanitarian aid as well . #% It is very clear that there is a strong move to reduce farm prices to world price levels and the levels of Eastern Europe to save money . #% Our Irish example shows that this is clearly not the case . #% Mr President , I supported the joint resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament decided to retain the reference and the call for a moratorium on these weapons . #% We have , as a country , chosen to remain nuclear-free . #% In the light of what has happened with the hushkits legislation I would like a response from the Commission . #% in writing . - Firstly , let me say that I welcome the moves of my colleagues , especially Senor de Castro , who has taken the initiative to start the debate on this issue . #% As I said , the rule must be that if Council is involved , Parliament is involved . #% This has been central to the problem of the common fisheries policy for decades and nothing that has been put in place by way of improvement has worked to date . #% I would not , and I am sure no other colleague would either . #% The President-in-Office of the Council has had three meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister , Mrs Çiller , to stress the importance we attach to early progress in the adoption and implementation of the further reforms necessary to ensure respect for human rights and we will continue to pursue the issue in contacts with Turkey . #% These people will not know their rights , not have legal representation . #% It then went back to the Bureau , and the Bureau made the decision on the basis of what , I assume , the Conference of Presidents had requested . #% That is a proposal which I tabled in December 2000 after Nice . #% Madam President , I extend my congratulations and good wishes on your election as President of the European Parliament . #% We in Parliament represent over 340 million individuals across the continent , all of whom suffer from the same problem of unemployment . #% This would ensure that human rights are given the kind of political priority the Commissioner has spoken of today . #% If we look at what has happened in Iraq , and even in Afghanistan , we can see that people still suffer as a result of the use of this weapon long after wars are over . #% Events in Belgium have focused international attention on the many loopholes which exist , both nationally and internationally , in our laws . #% Where dialogue does not take place , the gap is only filled by mutual misunderstandings and ritual condemnations and fear . #% To that end I wish to put on the official record that I intended no insult or aggression to any individual Member within this House and I wish to apologize unreservedly if my remarks were open to a different interpretation . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commission to clarify Article 14 . #% I welcome the fact that the newly established European Food Safety Authority will play a key role in assessing applications for authorisation . #% Recently a farmer -- who is a third-generation sheep farmer -- took me to see his last flock of sheep . #% We need a positive operational environment for SMEs . #% I refer you particularly to the importance of the SAVE programme . #% It is regrettable that there is such a mad rush to finalise this by May . #% On the manufacturing side , the industry has in the past provided a very important employment opportunity in the sugar plants , in addition to supporting employment in associated industries . #% Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU/IMF programme are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances . #% This makes it possible to use waste materials , which would normally be thrown away , in order to produce energy . #% The Committee on Institutional Affairs ' report contains many elements with which I am in total agreement . #% On the contrary , I believe that this differential treatment should be a spur to the Council to renegotiate our cooperation agreement with ASEAN . #% There was a moan or two for a week when we would forget to bring the old shopping bags , but in changing the mindset this tax on its own has done what years of talking in this Parliament and national parliaments could not do . #% The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown , other than we know that ecstasy is still a drug that can cause depression and memory impairment . #% This remains a concern of mine . #% But what is the future to be ? #% The fishermen will not find a regime legitimate unless they are able to make a contribution and their voice is heard . #% Were we given powers on condition that we would never use them ? #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , as Irish soldiers leave for Chad to protect refugees from neighbouring Sudan , I am again painfully reminded that this tragedy of genocide in Sudan continues day in and day out , without any end in sight . #% Surely , the US and the European Union governments can agree on one item , and that is simply that the use of greenhouse gases depletes the ozone layer which results in higher sea levels and more coastal erosion , and affects the living environment of island communities . #% I hope that in Göteborg the Council will find the wisdom lacking in the statement of the General Affairs Council to include the European Commission in the search for a way forward . #% The Presidency should also have been aware of the public attacks on the EOM by several government ministers , using such inflammatory language as ` these Western whites have no interest in peace in Pakistan ; these people come from unfriendly nations and have hostile objectives ; this Mission is interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan ' . #% But let us start somewhere ! #% 
With reference to Ireland , we need an independent body to monitor the transplantation and harvesting of donated organs . #% This would lead to products that are not organic and not GM-free being on the market labelled as organic . #% Each of us has focused on different priorities and , in many ways , we have ceased to understand each other 's concerns . #% The Union should aim to minimize the bureaucratic and administrative burden placed on our industry , particularly by Union directives and regulations . #% Adults are twice as likely as previously thought to develop cancer after being exposed to tritium and this particular tritium was discharged by a factory . #% We must listen to the 100,000 people who took to the streets in Ireland last week to express their anger at the ` Race to the Bottom ' threatened by the actions of the Irish Ferries company and the Bolkenstein Directive . #% I strongly support the family unit being based on the natural order of complementary sex couples and I value the benefit to children which results . #% The inclusion of natural sun radiation in the new Directive will disproportionately affect small agricultural and construction businesses and add unnecessary administrative costs , particularly in the Northern regions of Europe . #% The European Union must be equally professional and use all its combined forces to tackle these crime barons throughout the European Union . #% Citizens of each Member State must have access to the wide range of information concerning the factors affecting their health and on the way in which public health systems within that country meet their needs . #% For more than 20 years European policy in respect of waste management has been based on the principle of treating hazardous industrial waste and household and similar waste in a different way . #% Mr President , firstly , may I congratulate the rapporteur . #% I believe that anomaly has to be corrected . #% An amendment has been tabled calling for the directive to be transposed into national law by 13 June 2001 , instead of the Commission 's own proposal of 2002 . #% If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group , I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission , its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers . #% One of the most striking statistics in his report -- apart from the ever rising number of complaints , which the Ombudsman quite rightly points out is not necessarily a feature of deteriorating administration -- is the fact that 75 % of the complaints received by the Ombudsman 's office did not in fact relate to his mandate . #% I am now asking you , Mr President , to ensure that you conduct the vote tomorrow in an orderly way , to ensure that Parliament and its Members are permitted to vote as they are empowered to do by their democratic mandate to draft and make legislation . #% I must insist that nuclear energy is not sustainable and produces CO2 . #% But there are some questions still outstanding . #% It would be very untidy of us as a parliament to vote on a contradictory text in light of this most recent information . #% I am disappointed with the I-EDN Group which chose to table amendments and ask for split votes , thus taking up valuable time in this House . #% As Mr Watson rightly said , 40 journalists have been killed in Russia in the last two and a half years . #% I would , however , like to sound a note of caution . #% I would be appalled at that , but I am sure it is something she would never do . #% We are opposed to any other countries joining the nuclear club or the extension of the nuclear abilities of those powers already armed with nuclear weapons . #% Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease . #% The only solution that can achieve lasting peace in the region is a socialist Israel , alongside a socialist Palestine , in which borders are mutually agreed by both communities and are part of a democratic socialist confederation of the Middle East . #% Little wonder that we can not compete . #% Finally , I can not understand why the Commissioner is not putting pressure on Member States to ensure that they comply with Natura 2000 in the Alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of Community interest . #% The best method of preparing the sector is to put in place a stable , long-term support system for our family farms . #% This process should give priority to the meeting of human needs and the fulfilment of basic human rights . #% The future enlargement of the European Union to incorporate the ten central and eastern European countries is the most dramatic development ever to be contemplated or undertaken by the Union . #% One must of course have a level playing field as regards state aids and other similar areas , and we do have this . #% I am confident that the measures outlined above , and others , can contribute significantly to sustainable fishing and ultimately lead to sustainable fisheries . #% Do you understand the income crisis that exists among the vast majority of our farmers across the Europe of 25 ? #% Is she aware that its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste run to GBP 34 billion , while it has GBP 235 million worth of shareholders ' funds on its balance sheets ? #% Finally , it is important that , as newer technologies come on stream , this process must involve the consent and widespread participation of the general public and local communities . #% I would like to know what commitment the President-in-Office intends to show to ensure that EU policies will always give special priority to assisting peripheral and island regions , including those regions on the Atlantic coast . #% Indeed , in Northern Ireland last year , we only had , I think , three identifiable cases of BSE and the projection for this year is one or at worst maybe two . #% In food and water it is a curse . #% Mr President , I should like to call on the House to show its support and solidarity for the freedom of the press and for freedom of speech and to show its sympathy for the horrific death of an Irish journalist , Veronica Guerin , in Dublin last week . #% Now we hear new proposals coming forward that if we have a situation of enlargement , we have entirely new proposals for entirely new policies towards the new Member States and without any provision as to how these will be financed . #% I welcome the intention of the Commission to extend the scope of the 1992 directive on the control of illicit narcotics to include precursors used in the manufacture of these new drugs . #% Yes , the methodology of the Auto/Oil Programme was innovative but it had two problems : firstly , it took a long time , so that recent worries about , for example , particulates were not covered ; secondly , the European Parliament was involved at a very late stage . #% Mr President , it is clear that more initiatives will have to be implemented if the European Union is to become the most knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% That would result in a significant amount of pressure on national governments . #% I would like to take the questions on behalf of Mr Andrews , Mr Hyland and Mr Fitzsimons , who are at an ongoing Constitutional Affairs Committee meeting . #% What the Commissioner has said is that he is leaving it up to the Member States to pursue those areas where preferential access has been granted illegally . #% The subject of eugenic practices is one such subject which , through the adoption of Amendment 15 , was included in this resolution . #% Mr President , the image of the European Union has suffered greatly because of recent scandals relating to fraud . #% Mr President , the aim of the proposal is to facilitate the sale by telephone , fax and Internet of financial services such as banking , insurance , investment and mortgages while at the same time protecting the consumer from fraud , high-pressure salesmanship and certain unsolicited sales communications . #% The statistic this amendment presents on the main cause of death is inaccurate . #% An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation . #% In theory , nobody should be against it but I suspect there is much disparity in some areas , especially under the third pillar . #% The very best response , apart from the obvious security measures that we have to take , is to defend our ideas of freedom , of democracy , of justice and of ending exploitation . #% European political parties , that it is hoped might eclipse national parties , may fit the template of European integration , but the rock upon which they will perish is that of democratic rejection when they have to face the harsh reality of seeking a popular mandate from real people on real issues . #% Yet we do not take one measure in the form of renewable energy which would certainly provide jobs . #% It is a multilateral solution which enlists a reputable and widely trusted agency , the World Health Organisation . #% The fact that they are abandoning the sales ban is an absolute disgrace , apart from the fact that it was supposed to come into effect in 1998 . #% The changes introduced by this House have improved the proposal , and Mr Schlyter 's report is both balanced and objective . #% It is quite clear this is all driven by profit . #% We will , no doubt , continue cautiously , but progress is surely being made in recognizing that the guarantee fund is a vital part of the future for the European film industry . #% But this is not the vital and fundamental issue . #% Our quality food products are closely linked to our grass-based natural environment . #% It can not be an abortion if you are not pregnant . #% But what about a bigger industry , the Irish beef industry , which will not be allowed to stand in the way of global corporate farming either ? #% 
I have no confidence at all that Member States will maintain or indeed establish adequate standards . #% Each Member State will have to put in place procedures which can deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes . #% However , I believe that parts of this resolution , rather than bringing clarity to the rules , will only serve to confuse the general public and in particular funding operators . #% We must never lose hope . #% Finally , the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de-escalate the conflict . #% In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success . #% It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations . #% I wonder , Commissioner , whether you have ever considered the possibility of reversing the burden of proof . #% To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Ireland 's policy of having no age limit on gambling with the state-run tote . #% The EU Council must listen to the European Parliament in this regard . #% It is important that we make that distinction . #% I congratulate all parties in this process in reaching agreement to protect stricter laws in countries like Denmark , and in issues of labelling . #% It is a clear demonstration that the political process and the peace process are well under way . #% The Luas tribunal must begin as a matter of urgency . #% But we can work towards it and we are getting there . #% Mrs Kauppi has referred to the concerns regarding the legal basis in her attached explanatory memorandum . #% It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications . #% For all our aircraft in the middle to large categories we are now in basic agreement . #% It is seen as being interfering , over-burdensome , over-arching and , indeed , uncaring when it comes people 's everyday concerns . #% It has been a first presidency for Sweden , and I believe both your government and state can feel a justifiable pride in a job well done . #% I do not want to be alarmist in any way but the fact that the British Government has already acted is something which should be taken into consideration . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs believe the focus and priority for EU spending must be the funding of economic investment and research which boosts the economy and creates jobs . #% Only 8 % of all municipal waste in Ireland is recycled and this figure is simply too low . #% This is basically ICES ' way of saying that it is in deep trouble . #% I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on . #% The scientists blame the fishermen , the fishermen blame the scientists and we try to find a way through . #% Multiannual plans are vital to allow the sector to plan forward . #% - The EPLP delegation voted in favour of the compromise resolution on additionality because we believe that the principle of additionality is one of the core fundamental pillars of the structural funds reforms , for which I was Parliament ' s rapporteur . #% I welcome the fact that Macau 's crime rate has also improved . #% We need to recognise the effects and risks of reprocessing , shipment and reshipment on everyone , not just the countries of origin and destination that are making money from the nuclear business . #% We need to use EU money as a seed to grow local solutions . #% And I would remind you that disability is , in itself , still an area for development within the EU . #% I would argue that if the European Union admits third country nationals for the purpose of servicing the specific needs of individual Member States ' labour shortages then it would be repulsive to adopt a ` revolving door ' policy by taking no responsibility for the tangible economic input of workers from third countries . #% In particular , lifelong learning is becoming more important to people 's everyday lives , whether as regards access to opportunities to employment , or in using ATM machines to get cash , or having to go on-line to get banking and other services because local public services are being closed down in an era of competition and liberalisation . #% It is true that the rule would possibly have allowed bogus health care professionals and those struck off for malpractice to work in another Member State without having to register with the host country 's regulatory body . #% Concrete steps must be taken at the Luxembourg Summit to ensure that the battle against unemployment can be won . #% It is also desirable that the composition of the EU team should not only draw upon youthful idealism and enthusiasm but should also have considerable depth and wealth of experience . #% I hope that the next time that you come back to this chamber you will not respond in the same curt fashion that you did to Mr Newton Dunn , if the presidency wants to work with Parliament . #% Parliament is undoubtedly becoming more and more , as a result of your leadership , meaningful to the ordinary citizens of the Member States . #% The only country that has been ` wronged ' are the Irish fishermen who have been denied their natural share and who were never allowed to exploit the seas . #% The reality is that new information technologies are changing all the time . #% We have urged Mr Giscard d'Estaing not to have his little meetings behind closed doors . #% I come from a country which exports over 90 % of its entire beef production and quality and consumer satisfaction have always been a priority . #% I want though to reject the criticisms of the Socialist Group made by Jim Nicholson yesterday and again today . #% This situation I have no doubt is reflected in other Member states and surely it is not the way to engage citizens to feel politically concerned at local , national and European level . #% To some extent we are dealing with the issue of Box 7 ( A ) in the Irish Sea , which has been closed off at times recently , in cooperation with the fishermen . #% I also see the importance of community development measures that will stimulate the economy and activate untapped economic resources in the region . #% With the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation . #% The European Commission is best placed to lead a campaign in support of monetary union . #% That will help create trade diversification in our manufacturing and service economy base and stimulate economic growth to the benefit of European businesses and consumers alike . #% The outbreak of FMD in the European Union in 2001 was a disaster not only for agriculture but also for many related enterprises and organisations . #% We live in an internal market where there is free movement of people . #% The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate . #% I will be supporting paragraph 3 myself and will be indicating this to my Group , but there are those who have concerns about it . #% I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7 , even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt , but I go for a standardisation of the chip , and only the chip not the tattoo . #% In relation to Laos , we call on the authorities to release political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , develop a multi-party system where all views and opinions can be taken into account , respect religious minorities and their rights and allow UN agencies unrestricted access to all parts of the country . #% The only way we are going to do that is to ensure that environmental damage is considered one of the most serious crimes in our society . #% I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in Cancún , and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets . #% That had no precedent ever in European law making . #% However , despite my strong commitment to the process of enlargement , I acknowledge that we face real dilemmas during the process . #% Two of my constituents petitioned Parliament when their parents died in a carbon monoxide poisoning incident in a holiday apartment in Spain . #% I welcome the Commission 's assurance that any distortion of trade which might arise as a result of these labelling measures will be dealt with . #% Clearly the problems of the telecoms sector have been difficult for satellites in the European Union . #% I should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports . #% Without the agreement of the UN Security Council , this war would be a breach of international law , would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral . #% The European Union is a political model that has helped to bring peace to our continent . #% 
Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year . #% Of course , there is more work to be done . #% I once heard a former member of the Council of Ministers say that he put the question informally to all of the finance ministers who were seated around the table : ' What are NCAs ? ' . #% You have our support , Mr Barroso . #% However , to even consider , by definition or otherwise , banning all products that come from remunerated donors is a retrograde step . #% There is one point of detail I would like to finish on . #% Mr President , the European LIFE programme is the key European Union initiative to integrate environmental measures into the broad ambit of European Union policies . #% A great many of our children have suffered . #% We need to listen to that child as mothers do , and to help them find a way to reconcile home and work to the benefit of both . #% As you are probably aware I did lobby your government colleagues , Minister Quinn and Minister Michael Lowry , in June of this year , urging that the Irish presidency should take this up as one of their issues . #% You and some of your ministers will need to be courageous in standing up to the lobby groups that want to push us down a single road . #% We are calling on both sides to cooperate fully with the International Red Cross on the question of the disappeared and missing since the conflict began . #% In fact , the pattern of harassment of human rights activists and opposition figures and church personnel has reached alarming levels . #% The two sides will not be brought together unless there is an immediate and serious third-party mediation , and the US government must be seen to be vigorously involved in this process in a firm and meaningful way , as must the European Union . #% It is the first time that they have submitted comprehensive proposals . #% Initially , we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed . #% It is now 12 months since President Hänsch appointed me as his special mediator on transnationally abducted children . #% There is also the whole question of neutrality which has not been touched on . #% In Ireland we have had governments which have neglected or even denied our rights , but under the shelter of our constitution , even the most vulnerable of us can demand them . #% Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe . #% This means that we also have to have a crisis initiative in order to enable us to support the future crisis sectors . #% The European Union and national Member States must work closely together at all times with Europe ' s motor and oil industry so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future . #% I am sure that everyone is as relieved as I am that they were released and have now left Afghanistan and returned to their homes . #% Will the Commission address this issue ? #% To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks . #% In other words , it would mean giving in to the logic of the generals , not accepting the decision of the people and basically undermining the National League for Democracy . #% Unfortunately , that seems to be too often the case . #% ( Laughter ) I travel through Frankfurt airport and there our European passports have been described by customs as a joke . #% After the first reading , the Council accepted 16 of the committee 's 26 amendments , which included the provision that the depositing of proof of insurance in one Member State should suffice for all Member States . #% Now today , while we concentrate our focus on human rights in Europe I would urge you to look at one section of our society in Europe for whom the situation is no better than anywhere else in the world : I am talking here about women . #% From the outset I would stress that economic and social cohesion is an enshrined principle now and for the future . #% This morning we are dealing only with the first , a proposal to improve the intervention access , changes to the various premium schemes and other changes in the beef sector . #% People should have the right to defend themselves when they are accused or allegations made against them . #% The alternative will inevitably be overfishing and problems for the industry in the long term . #% With the help of European Union structural fund investment in tourism projects in recent years , it has been possible to record significant advances in the tourism sector . #% I am quite sure that Archbishop Courtney 's family and many friends will appreciate the support of the European Parliament at this time . #% I appreciate and understand the constraints which the President-in-Office of the Council has with this question . #% On a humanitarian basis , I want to ask you why you wrote this letter to Mr Howard . #% There , we compete with fishermen from the Republic of Ireland , whereas the Northern Ireland fisherman for years has been subject to those draconian UK penalties . #% In my view the death of Robert McCartney was not in any way politically motivated . #% In Ireland we have a commonly used phrase - `` if it is not broken , why fix it '' . #% I agree with Mr Poettering when he said that those who have been waging that war and taking those lives should not be rewarded for bringing an end to that now . #% At least that would go some distance to compensate fishermen for the loss and fishing areas for the loss of jobs they have experienced . #% We must also enhance cooperation and communication channels between organisation and stakeholders concerned . #% We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information . #% If their representatives do not reflect their will , they are replaced . #% Also under discussion , although not in this plenary session , is the renewal of the multi-annual guidance programme , which has also been stalled due to the Council 's inability to make a decision . #% It is to them , not to the institutions of Europe , that I owe my allegiance . #% Contradictory approaches are almost impossible to explain to the non-initiated general public , and , in my opinion , completely undermine our collective credibility . #% Ironically the European Union can take pride in its achievement in improving health , safety and working conditions through the implementation of the social chapter . #% However , amendments have been tabled in line with its proposals and these must also be accepted by the House , otherwise we will be in deep conflict with our citizens . #% However , even if we achieve the increased budget sought in this report , increasing it to EUR 54 million , we will still be only scratching the surface . #% Enshrined within this process must be recognition of the role of smaller states , which must be protected within any new future institutional framework . #% Commissioner Byrne 's White Paper on food safety sets the ground rules and parameters within which the practical application of genetic research impacts on public health and the environment , and I have no doubt the vigilance of Parliament is a further safeguard . #% I turn to the report by Mr Purvis . #% The proposed EN 1384 standard is a compromise which does not provide the best possible protection available , as required by the personnel protective equipment directive . #% Ireland has one of the worst records , second only to Spain , for greenhouse gas emissions . #% Turning briefly to the reports , the proposal from the Commission to allocate an extra ECU 1.4 billion to the beef sector is very welcome but I can not accept the method of funding proposed , namely to reduce aid to cereal farmers by the same amount . #% I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment who supported the compromise package and the Council for recognising the importance of this compromise and for putting the recommendation on COREPER 's agenda at very short notice . #% He has set the problem out very well . #% Mr President , at the threshold of the Twenty-first Century women 's bodies are used , often gratuitously , to sell goods in order to make money for other people . #% However , I do not believe that these peace talks were a complete failure either . #% The primary motive of much organised crime is financial crime . #% Let us listen to sound scientific advice and trust in our own food safety system , which I believe is second to none . #% But the real challenge for the Irish presidency will be to get concrete results so that these aspirations are not left as empty sentiments . #% I believe that history will justifiably acknowledge her contribution , if the present negotiations bring permanent peace . #% 
On top of that I believe the present Amsterdam Treaty for the first time underlines the importance of employment within the overall European Union development . #% The petitioners and complainants invested in what they thought was a properly regulated market according to UK and EU law . #% I hope this kind of support will maintain this very important committee . #% It is vital , of course , that workers ' standards and conditions are protected and not undermined ; guarantees have to be retained that the progress made on workers ' pay and conditions over the years is not undermined in any way . #% I would ask those in this House who are supporting Mr Berlusconi in opposing the European arrest warrant to ask themselves why are they supporting a situation where the criminals who put these people into this container will escape the justice which needs to be meted out to them ? #% Mr President , coming as I do from a small country which landfills 99 % of its waste , I am particularly anxious to make a few remarks about this extremely important directive . #% I am a diabetic and were it not for biotechnology from the liver of a poor innocent pig I would be a dead man today . #% The European Research Council , for example , has done much to support individual scientists . #% Given these experiences , we should not be alarmed at the prospect of taking similar decisions in other areas rather than face paralysis and stagnation at the hands of eurosceptic Member States . #% Conversely , we can not ignore the importance of transport in contributing to economic growth and development . #% It has also used inhumane cluster bombs . #% I am slightly disappointed in the answer to the question . #% If we proceed with ` one size fits all ' legislation which ignores the particularities of individual countries or regions , we risk alienating our citizens . #% Minister , is that answer not a pitiful and cowardly cop-out ? #% Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Dell ` Alba 's report and its recognition that the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund are an innovative means of consolidating the peace process . #% I give my group 's official position first , after which I will make a couple of points myself as the President 's mediator for transnationally abducted children . #% I just wish to congratulate the Commissioner on his replies . #% The labour force is growing steadily and unemployment is at last beginning to fall , down from almost 16 % in 1993 to actually just over 11 % this year . #% I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his report , which contains many good things : an admittance that pharmaceuticals can cause more mental illness than they cure ; a recognition of the importance of childhood for mental health with a call for support for families ; a recognition that employment can affect mental health for better and for worse ; and the need to consult those who have recovered from mental illness to learn how recovery happened . #% in writing . - The objective of any waste policy is to minimise the negative effects of waste on human health and the environment . #% We are abdicating our duty as legislators to stand back and to pause and reflect . #% Mr Trichet , can you give us the facts on the inflationary effects or otherwise of abolishing the 1 and 2 cent coins ? #% Our farming and food production sector is facing great uncertainty at the moment and we must be vigilant in ensuring that any steps we propose serve to enhance the position of these crucial industries . #% The present instability and violence can not and must not continue indefinitely . #% Indeed , whereas we feared the Ecofin Council under some duress may unnecessarily want to toughen what has been suggested by the Commission , which we hope will not happen , we believe Parliament has just voted a set of amendments which unnecessarily go in precisely the opposite direction . #% While a lot more work is needed prior to any legislative initiative from the Commission - and I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein 's offer of a second round of consultation - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has laid out its stall , proposing separate core settlement services as a user-owned or public service , governed by the rules of non-profit status . #% The document tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs should have confined itself to a simple recommendation to vote for or against the Amsterdam Treaty . #% in writing . - The current RoHS restricts the use of six hazardous materials that were once contained in certain electrical and electronic equipment . #% And I think the Commissioner should encourage the continuation of good cooperation because it creates a good atmosphere all round and creates a very good working relationship . #% We need to protect these industries which create jobs and boost our economy - not just locally , but in the European domain . #% Anti-pollution devices must remain effective for at least 80 000 km or five years from the year 2000 onwards , and for at least 100 000 km from 2005 . #% These vary considerably throughout the Union . #% You are denying the reality of the situation if you say that force-feeding does not cause unnecessary suffering or injury . #% And , if not , could it make one at the next part-session at the beginning of July in Brussels ? #% It was clear when I was in Canada in 1990 that nothing had been done on it up to then . #% The fees issue was also hotly contested . #% For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes . #% The fishermen are looking for a fundamental review of the current quota system , they are looking for a review of the tie-up policies , they are looking for a review of the direction of the Common Fisheries Policy , they are looking for a review of the best way to achieve proper cod recovery and to achieve the recovery of other fish stocks . #% I would fully agree with you . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I know that this is not one of our most headline-grabbing reports , but it deserves to be , because this Prospectus Directive has actually been crucial to regulating European firms ' access to capital . #% Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States . #% A lack of enforcement systems for payment undermines the internal market and business confidence . #% The implications of this are very traumatic , because incomes will fall despite the compensation that is on offer . #% Commissioner , may I say ` more power to your elbow ! ' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court , because we can not have one Member State playing a different game from the others . #% Some countries bailed out their own banks at huge cost to the taxpayers , without any handouts from the EU . #% I know in the major scheme of things this might seem like a detail , but we have a responsibility . #% In fact , only one Member spoke and he did not address the issue of Northern Ireland . #% Firstly , do we know how many missing children there are in the enlarged European Union ? #% We also need to follow through on existing dossiers , be it the services directive , the protection of public services or the right to universal service , and bring these into being . #% It would seem they would prefer to forget the events in Tiananmen Square and yet at the same time they will protest loud and long about the denial of democracy and human rights in other parts of the world with which they have no significant trade . #% In the year 2000 smuggling of tobacco caused losses of GBP 3.8 million to the British Exchequer . #% If you stick a funnel down a goose 's throat and force-feed it with maize , there is no way that you are not causing suffering or injury . #% The rapporteur mentions the ` plastic soup ' , the drifting mass of plastic and rubber in the Pacific Ocean , and notes what is described as an increasing problem in the Atlantic Ocean of lost fishing nets . #% They should mean something and there should be consequences if they are repeatedly breached . #% This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water . #% Mr President , the Northern hake stock is outside safe biological limits . #% Sometimes in Parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing . #% In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events , but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties . #% Commissioner you say that as far as new facilities are concerned , if there are to be any , you feel that there is a case . #% While I was speaking I said that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Dublin this evening meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister . #% The importance of education can not be underlined enough . #% Producers or importers should assume responsibility for the recovery and safe disposal of all pesticide packaging and pesticides past their expiry date and revoked pesticides products . #% Right across Europe , the abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is a growing problem . #% That must be the underlying basis of our strategies with regard to the quality of jobs , work and employment opportunities available - the kinds of skills that we give to people . #% We will vote against that amendment . #% We need to think about that again in more detail when we consider the health programmes themselves . #% 
Your job in promoting the Plan D -- debate , democracy and dialogue -- is being undermined by the fact that the Council continues to refuse to make law in public . #% It is important that we have a dialogue not only with Kosovo but also with Serbia , to give them the encouragement to move forward and to find a new path in the nation-building process . #% Our responsibility is to find a balance between the needs of employed and self-employed drivers and the community at large , so as to ensure that the latter can go about its business safely . #% They were then told , in 2003 and 2004 , that further adjustments had to be made to take account of the approaching World Trade Organization talks . #% Community agricultural statistics #% I applaud the view expressed by the Commissioner that we all share the task of selling this historic challenge but I deplore the fact that someone as pre-eminent as Commissioner Verheugen , at least according to a number of newspapers today , should say the Member States should not leave the Commission to do the dirty job alone . #% My one big criticism of the destruct scheme is that it did not particularly insist that Member States with a problem targeted the older cow , where the real risk cohort still remained . #% All our countries need the Hague Convention . #% These alternatives to cadmium are what we really need , and they already exist . #% A negotiated settlement is still the only real long-term solution for the securing of a peace settlement in Chechnya . #% Madam President , I wish to express my thanks to the President-in-Office and to the Commission President for their contributions to this debate here this morning . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate the rapporteur and say that it is not before time that we had this debate in Parliament ; but the more we talk , the less we appear to do on issues like this . #% Child obesity is a serious problem in Ireland and in Europe and this problem must be effectively tackled head-on . #% The values of democracy were distorted , unwarranted concession after concession was made , but as each was pocketed , new demands appeared . #% I wish to put on record , as someone who has a long-standing interest in that policy question , that I ask whether I am entitled to receive a copy of the written and oral submissions which were made on behalf of the House on an issue which is of grave concern to many Members . #% Because of procrastination then hundreds of thousands of people needlessly died in ethnic cleansing . #% I hope , in the context of Mr Evans ' report , there will be some way in which we can hear - preferably directly from the people who have been helped by this - precisely what the effect of the Tempus programme has been on their countries . #% Unlike Mr Cunha I can not offer him a remedy for a speedy recovery , but a hot Irish whiskey is not bad for the flu either . #% She did not say what it was , but she certainly signalled that it was going to go in during the debate yesterday . #% Two hours might be too much in that case , let alone four hours . #% The Council is wrong in trying to say this is the Commission 's responsibility . #% I welcome attempts to harmonise the management of packaging waste while recognising the high initial cost of putting in place schemes for recovery , recycling and sorting of waste . #% A strong pillar of direct payments is vital for the world and to meet food demands . #% It is up to us , who support enlargement of the Union and who recognise the absolute right of candidate countries to join the Union , to convince our voting citizens of the importance of the provisions of the Treaty of Nice and of its broader political implications . #% The timing of this decision , however , is a highly cynical one , considering that it was made as a smokescreen at the same time as war was declared on terrorism . #% As Commissioner Patten said , the agenda for the talks which are presently under way is a very serious European agenda and one that must be addressed before we can make progress . #% Mr President , I understand the ideal contained in this report to complete the internal market in the railway sector , thereby allowing freight transport by rail to compete successfully with freight transportation by road . #% And , finally , what is the Commission 's up-to-date view with regard to continuing GSP + with Sri Lanka , considering that , after the election , the policies of Mr Rajapaksa 's government continue to be against human rights and workers ' rights in that country ? #% I voted in favour of this report , but I am disappointed that some of the most important aspects were rejected . #% Finally , we all have to take responsibility for what has happened and to shoulder a little of the blame . #% I have put my suggestions before you . #% The Commission is meant to be putting together a policy on invasive alien species , but so far we have seen no sign of it . #% Unless crops are grown , harvested , processed , eaten , and even the waste disposed of in laboratories , it is inevitable that there will be contamination . #% It appears that , so far as we understand it , about 11 of these people came from Turkey , one from Albania and one from Algeria . #% I am also concerned about United Kingdom organic farmers being undermined by products from Eastern European countries . #% Madam President , I should like to ask you to protest vehemently on behalf of all of us at the savage and brutal public execution on Tuesday of a mother of seven children by the Taliban regime in Kabul . #% in writing . - While tuberculosis is viewed by many in the past tense and seen as a 19th century affliction , it continues to have a serious impact , both directly and indirectly , on the lives of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the EU each year . #% A CO2 tax applied to all polluters should be used to reduce other taxes and applied equally to all sectors , for example agriculture and smelting . #% I really think it is irresponsible of the EU to push something through without a proper study being carried out and , as Mr Miller said , any studies done to date have been by vested interests on both sides . #% It is clear that there is a need to improve on aspects of monitoring the Common Fisheries Policy and proper sanctions for those in infringement . #% I appreciate the difficulties that remain regarding the issues of refugees and settlements but I do call on leaders from both sides to stand firm in their support of the Roadmap . #% Have you any estimate -- at Commission level -- of how long it will take Romania to tackle what is a huge problem for the country ? #% Many Irish missionaries are involved in this work . #% The common organization of the market in beef is an important measure in the overall framework of the common agricultural policy and is of great importance to my country , Ireland , where beef production is one of the main farm enterprises . #% The future instrument must ensure better integration of environmental and climate change issues in developing cooperation . #% There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act . #% The Greens have tabled a series of amendments with a view to converting the money spent on fusion to promoting sustainable and renewable energies . #% I am very shocked that my own government has made several attempts to water down EU proposals to regulate emissions of electromagnetic radiation from mobile home masts . #% People will be none the wiser , because we do not have labelling . #% They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework . #% After the defeat of the Tamil Tigers , the nightmare continues for the Tamil people , especially in the north of Sri Lanka , with 300 000 people - including 31 000 children - forcefully detained in camps where disease and malnutrition are rife . #% The country is proud of you . #% I cautiously welcome Prime Minister Sharon 's announced intention of complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , but there are a number of conditions that must be met in the context of future Israeli withdrawal from Gaza . #% We were not all that good , but we were very lucky . #% This has led to a situation in Europe where TB is not the persistent threat is once was . #% It is wrong that our money is being used in this way . #% Let us vote on the issue before us and not mix up other issues with it . #% In another sense , both politically and scientifically , a huge amount has happened in the whole area of TSE , more particularly if you like , in relation to BSE . #% Part of the reason for that seems to me to have been a piece of written advice that was circulated , which pre-empted my proposals by claiming that PPE policy had been decided . #% All of us must avoid inflaming the debate by raising issues which could be interpreted as threatening in many national capitals . #% The Irish delegation will vote for President Prodi and the Commission . #% At the same time , amongst the 7 200 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails , also held in breach of the Geneva Conventions , 1 500 are held for an indefinite period and 13 have already served 25 years . #% In his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , Mr Solana talked about having a less declaratory and more active foreign policy . #% We worry unduly about the countries which will stay out and pursue soft currency policies in order to gain competitiveness . #% It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve . #% When we look at the Council meeting and the results from it , there have been some successes . #% 
The challenge , when dealing with something as widespread , serious and preventable as injury , is to save lives and preserve health . #% However , Article 182 ( 5 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon , which establishes measures necessary for the implementation of the European research area , could provide a more appropriate legal basis for future joint programming initiatives in the field of research . #% We do not want to create a situation where airlines will decide to fly regardless of what the outcome will be . #% The discussions that will take place on 4 October will be the next phase of these important negotiations . #% Two weeks after the world is advised of the most brutal genocide following elections in an attempt to establish the very essence of democracy which we , as Parliamentarians , above all should uphold , we are not yet in gear and not seen as relevant to the solution by any commentators . #% It is good that we have recognised the need to test children 's medicine specifically for children . #% On average , the Latvian fleet is some 20 years old , whereas the EU vessels which will be transferred can be as young as five years . #% Mr President , I should like your guidance . #% Indeed , we will need sellers in the market for it to work . #% Furthermore , as the sea is the ultimate sink for much industrial material from the shores and rivers these sources must be included within the definition . #% We can not contemplate a centralized monetary policy without a coherent parallel economic policy , subject to appropriate democratic control . #% ISPAT in Cork , Ireland , which was formerly a state company , was bought over some years ago by a private company and is now in liquidation . #% A one-year grace period during which the home country insurer would be obliged to continue cover is perfectly reasonable . #% Social Security and Pensions , #% If the patients - not the pharmaceutical or blood companies - are asking us , we should listen to them and respond to them . #% Therefore you have to go down in a lift to the ground floor and cross across the buildings outside or inside and get to another lift and go up there to get from one side of the building to another . #% The scope of the regulation is absolutely clear on that as well : global warming reduction targets , air quality improvement . #% The reason I underline this point is that the role of the Irish navy is not an Irish one ; it is undertaking a European task . #% In the long and complex history of Anglo-Irish relations and relations on the island of Ireland , and especially the violent history of the past 25 years in Northern Ireland , one lesson is beyond any possible doubt : that violence from whatever source postpones the day of reconciliation . #% I have serious doubts about this . #% The Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party believes that there is a credibility gap at the heart of Union economic policy , which is undermining public confidence in the entire enterprise . #% She also failed to deal with issues such as coherency with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had . #% I do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of EID , particularly in relation to traceability and disease control , has been assessed . #% The Council has instead persisted with its vague commitment to consider the matter when the location of future landfills is chosen . #% Mr President , I think that this is a very noble initiative and it shows Europe at its best . #% For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost-effective . #% Thanks to British Midland International and the good work of their staff , I got here rather late , but still I am here . #% Democracy depends on the public being informed . #% By all means let us protect and encourage those who want to produce speciality foods , but let us also recognise that EU agriculture produces high-specification commodities which are also in need of protection . #% I am pleased that Mrs Gradin said that the Commission would deal speedily with this , but I am dismayed that the Council says that it has no timetable in its agenda . #% The Council of Europe is in the process of completing preparations for the world ' s first international convention on cyber crime . #% Like others , I want to express my deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends of those who have died . #% I abstained on the vote because no mention or condemnation was made of the recent attempt of the French Parliament to brand and outlaw certain Bible Protestants in France as sectarian . #% We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle . #% There is a clear and demonstrable link between growth and research and development . #% The message we should send out is that there should be an absolute and complete end to violence . #% Let us have space policy in the Convention . #% It was a great shame to see that Ireland was one of the countries not implementing the required directives , and I would hope that our government will change that and immediately implement them . #% Similarly , we can not accept the ECR toolbox-based approach without sufficient evidence and impact assessment to demonstrate that this is the best way to protect consumers and help businesses . #% The NGOs know where they are and there is no reason why we should not have the information . #% As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now . #% Too many people see us now as working against the Commission , and I want to warn that is not a healthy trend . #% If Sinn Féin had participated in the debate this morning they would -- although they are the direct political opposites in Northern Ireland -- have been making exactly the same case . #% I certainly agree . #% As far as natural radiation is concerned , risks must be pointed out and reasonable precautions must be taken , but Member States should have the responsibility for drawing up the action plan , and that should give legal certainty to workers and employers in different countries . #% This is erroneous . #% Let me begin by saying that the Greens support the proposal of the Commission for both the FIFG and the MAGP . #% Commissioner , can I ask that in seven years ' time the red squirrel be added to that list of biodiversity successes ? #% That would greatly help . #% Even though they do not apply to all the beneficiary Member States in the same way and to the same degree , I subscribe to the rapporteur 's concerns about other environmental aspects relating to the fund . #% We are going to end up with a serious problem in relation to the marine environment . #% Members ought perhaps to be aware that this is not a very nice way of behaving towards the staff of Parliament . #% I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them . #% Mr Commissioner , deny it as you will , but is that not the truth of the matter that these socio-economic pressures help you attain that goal ? #% The question of safety of nuclear fuel shipments is an urgent one . #% There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union . #% It has had to bed down the peace process and make it worthwhile for people to abandon their support for paramilitary organisations and to engage in constructive and proactive work , both north and south , across the border and in border areas . #% I want to see Axis I , in particular , accentuated , not diminished , with money actually getting to farmers , not being hijacked into government departments . #% We need to reduce amounts of waste in landfill and incineration . #% Sympathetic utterances are not enough . #% Negotiations surrounding ACTA need to be more open , and the Commission and Council need to show their willingness in this by ensuring Parliament has broad access to documents on the issue . #% I am confident that by the end of the Irish presidency , in six weeks ' time or so , we will have made significant progress in the whole justice and home affairs area . #% There seems to be some misunderstanding . #% It is time to face up to it and bury the corpse that is the EU Constitution . #% I believe we must do more to assist those interested in a restructuring programme - and the rapporteur made reference to it in his report - through the pooling of land and human resources , which would lead to greater efficiency and improved competitiveness . #% But having scoured medical literature and asked colleagues to point out to me the scientific and medical evidence , I can not find examples of people who have overdosed or killed themselves with vitamin C and various others . #% 
On a separate matter , the European Commission has already stated that the reduction in the use of tobacco products will be a key political objective of this European Commission . #% I hope that they are practical and achievable , as regards the various aspects in the proposal . #% It certainly looks very bleak at present for those fishing communities . #% In relation to our joint motion for a resolution , I believe that those MEPs that have just returned from Guantánamo should be given an opportunity to contribute to that motion and improve its accuracy , effectiveness and credibility . #% I want to wish you all well : Mr Prodi , Mr Kinnock and everybody else who is taking on enormous responsibilities on behalf of the people of the European Union . #% I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz . #% in writing . - I wholeheartedly welcome the approval of $ 7.45 m in EU aid to help retrain 850 workers made redundant from SR Technics . #% Either there is something wrong with the foods in question , in which case they should be banned , or they are safe , in which case no special rules are required . #% I think it is very timely , and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone , because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection . #% I support the Commission 's assessment that the EU has an overall health situation and health care system that are among the best in the world . #% In the last ten years there has been an unprecedented rise in forced and voluntary migration worldwide . #% When Ireland joined the European Union it had 59 % of the Community average . #% It is rather disappointing that our ambitions of seven to be added last summer have been reduced to up to three at this stage . #% That is what we are doing here today . #% Our market is open . #% As a sovereign , non-nuclear nation , we in Ireland have a right to self-determination in terms of our people 's health and environment . #% Parliament has a duty to support what the Environment Committee is proposing . #% The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland . #% As regards the modified proposal on the efficiency performance reserve , Parliament must be involved in decisions on the mid-term review and the reallocation of the national reserve . #% But these brave women , the McCartney women , through refusing to be intimidated in their four-month campaign for justice for their brother and their partner , have achieved more to highlight the residual thuggery and criminality that has existed in Northern Ireland since the official IRA ceasefire than either of the two governments or the political establishment in Northern Ireland have managed to achieve in the last decade . #% The United Kingdom Government announced last year that it would offer an extra EUR 8 billion over the 2007-2013 budget period to help the new Member States build their economies and societies . #% Listening to discussions in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , it is not clear if these concerns are grounded or not . #% I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts , regardless of who their employer is . #% Nepal has accepted a compromise put forward by the UNHCR who has been playing an important role in seeking to help to resolve the impasse . #% This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves . #% I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group . #% In June 1995 the Council of Ministers adopted wide-ranging rules on the transport of animals . #% It is however regrettable that some unnecessary , unhelpful amendments have crept in at the last stage in committee . #% It is not uncommon for birthday , Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and , ultimately , with the Irish Exchequer . #% We are all seeking to ensure that we put in place a Treaty which can govern the operation of the Union over the next 50 years . #% Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes . #% Mr President , in relation to BSE , dioxins and concern about the safety of GM foods , this House has been vigilant and responsive to consumer concerns . #% This is not a resolution for doing nothing , as many Americans would say , but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning . #% It is not only a question of seeking to prevent violence by different factions in the Middle East , it is primarily a question of guaranteeing that conditions can be improved in the hope that the violence ends and that negotiations can be reopened . #% Madam President , I believe that the EU leaders ' recent meeting in Tampere in Finland was a very successful one . #% It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk . #% The future of the common agricultural policy and structural funds , together with the obvious need for a bigger budget in an enlarged Union , are all difficult political issues which should be tackled in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference . #% I commend the resolution to the House . #% This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region . #% Domestic violence aims to control and destroy the human spirit . #% Mindful of what the Minister has said , and also of what Mr Hyland has said , Mr Cunningham gave a commitment to have this matter looked into in some detail at the Agricultural Ministers ' Meeting . #% It was very questionably driven by design criteria and not performance criteria . #% However , the Commission must ensure that there is coherence in EU industrial policy and that the EU budget is not used to increase shareholder value in some companies , while EU workers pay a price . #% It is for these reasons I believe that those detractors who are voicing concerns about the operation of the Irish economy are over-reacting . #% I would highlight one special case in this regard : the situation of the lime industry . #% I note that there are concerns . #% Mr President , I wish to draw attention to this magazine called the Parliament magazine which purports to be a record , and to represent the opinions , of this House . #% Mr President , I share the general disappointment at the failure of the Amsterdam Treaty to take on board the business it was supposed to discuss , which was the formation of an energy chapter . #% It basically promotes the whole idea of a fortress Europe , keeping out the so-called undesirables , whereas we should be looking at why people are seeking asylum , not victimising them . #% Ladies and gentlemen , I hope you will visit the exhibition outside this hemicycle on the Teres II programme . #% Mr President , first of all let me say that it seems there is no more a case for harmonising corporate tax rates or bases than there is for harmonising property taxes , wealth taxes or capital gains tax . #% This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation , but progress , I regret , is far too slow . #% Refugees have died in holding pens in modern-day Europe , without sanitation or proper services . #% But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament . #% The main reason for that is that they do not have access to more long-term finance than just a one-year term loan . #% In particular , I would like his views on the reflections of the Europol expert who said that there was no effective cooperation or coordination because of a series of political , legislative and judicial problems . #% I do not accept that British fishermen have been wronged , because if you look at the figures the British fishing industry is getting its natural share of European fish . #% Mr President , speakers have drawn attention to a number of problems , including cigarette smuggling . #% With the measures agreed in this package of legislation , they will be reduced by more than 20 % from the 1995 levels by 2012 . #% I would also like to thank him for taking on board many of the Verts/ALE Group 's suggestions . #% We need a strategy . #% I would appeal to other states to do so . #% I want to say to the House here in the couple of seconds available to me that , in my view , one of the ways of relieving people from the terrible poverty they face is by investing in bringing about land ownership in the developing world . #% First of all with regard to all EU fisheries agreements , not just Moroccan agreements : they should follow the precautionary approach . #% That is to be welcomed . #% These same people , of course , are those who would have been quite content to allow Saddam 's tyranny to continue undisturbed . #% 
His detention is part of the most severe police crackdown in China in decades . #% These programmes have demonstrated palpable success over their lifespan and have contributed to the modernisation of the educational and training systems in Europe . #% Mr President , last year when I spoke in this debate , I said that annual reports provide an opportunity not to look backwards , to assign blame and criticize , but to look forward and learn from the difficulties that we have had in programme implementation . #% There is a particular need to follow up on research in relation to the effect of breast implants and , as has been pointed out by Mr Miller , implants in other parts of the body . #% The directive which is before us today has two principal key objectives : first , to harmonise national legal provisions on food supplements so as to reduce and eliminate considerable problems facing the free movement of food supplements ; second , to establish an appropriate level of consumer protection in the use of food supplements in the European Union Member States . #% It goes without saying that any sudden adjustment or withdrawal of funds would have a detrimental effect on the Irish economy and would serve to undermine the success that we have achieved in recent times . #% Not everywhere has the same problems and I am deeply conscious of the need , where necessary , to ensure that regional differences are respected . #% The figures are startling : 18 million people across the EU suffer from severe depression ; 58 000 of our citizens commit suicide every year -- roughly equivalent to two or three small towns in any rural area being obliterated every year . #% At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century . #% Therefore , existing imbalances and discrepancies between core and peripheral regions should be counterbalanced by giving special stress to the setting up of information highways and facilities in the peripheral regions . #% It will be seen for what it surely will be : a crusade by the West against Islam . #% So even the definition of what is a minority language is something which needs to be examined . #% That proved to be disastrous , because it encouraged a belief that you could keep a foot in both camps . #% To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy . #% It is also quite clear from the rapporteur 's report that this is the case . #% However , Turkey entered into agreements with the European Union , under the Ankara Protocol , to do certain things . #% It is crucial that the EU applies restrictions on a fishing effort within this area . #% While social protection , social security and social advantages are important areas , they can not be considered ` services ' and are best dealt with elsewhere . #% The problem as I see it is that everyone comes here to these debates and makes all the right statements , says all the right platitudes , but they are not prepared to take the tough decisions necessary to help those most in need . #% Firstly , I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties . #% This is one of the most important issues to be dealt with by Parliament in the last few years . #% The fact that most , if not all , of the people involved in this murder are either members or supporters of the IRA or Sinn Féin in no way excuses their actions . #% I welcome the fact that we are going to give more responsibility to local fishermen closer to the areas in which they work . #% I will take a slightly different perspective . #% Some of that debate unfortunately centred around the common agricultural policy . #% In Montreal it was agreed that there would be two tracks in the negotiations : one for the UNFCC framework and the other for the Kyoto Protocol . #% Some 9 000 people from cross-community groups have been involved in these projects for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and some 5 000 people have been involved in the cross-border projects . #% Commissioner , given the Commission 's desire to control its own propaganda -- as evidenced by Commissioner Wallström 's announcement recently of her proposal for a politically-controlled European news outlet , the EBS -- what confidence can exist that any attempt will be made at striking a balance in terms of the distribution of funding between organisations and individuals promoting a pro-Constitution stance and those who promote an anti-Constitution stance ? #% For colleagues who are not aware of it , there is yet another general strike in France tomorrow , so the trains will not be able to get here . #% Therefore I strongly support the interoperability aim of IDA and its support of community policies as outlined by Mrs Read , those that are traditional -- agriculture , employment statistics -- and those that are newer -- civil protection , humanitarian aid and justice and home affairs . #% Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today . #% Two months on I have still to receive outstanding items and my visa card has been debited the full amount . #% However , I remain unconvinced by the buy-out scheme . #% Global issues of maintaining peace and security are best addressed in an effective multilateral system within a European Union working together with the US Government , the Canadian Government and our partners at the United Nations to combat international terrorism , tackle global poverty and promote democratic values . #% That area was also closed when the Norwegians were working on the project , and scientists came forward with new conclusions that did not affect the industry . #% Our government was obliged by a Supreme Court decision to spend as much money telling the public the reasons to vote `` no '' as the reasons to vote `` yes '' . #% This hardly supports the fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity . #% Surely in this era of competition we should permit public airports to compete with private airports for the generation of air travel business , because at the end of the day it will mean cheaper air prices for consumers . #% . -- Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Winkler , and President Barroso for their presentations here today . #% We should bear in mind , as the Commissioner has pointed out , that it has taken two and a half years to get to this point through negotiations with five presidencies . #% I would appreciate a Commission response . #% Why , if quotas are being observed , do we need such emphasis on tonnage ? #% We can not seriously ask the people to support us in the European elections next year and at the same time pretend we do not have a role and that we have nothing to say about the direction the world is going in . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Banotti for raising this very important issue in the House . #% UN sanctions are applied with a ferocity that tears apart the fragile consensus of the region . #% They are not even afraid of further development or enlargement of the European Union . #% Finally , Taoiseach , you deserve a rest after all your hard work . #% As the Commissioner himself has said , it has not been defined as low-leakage or low-dispersal material . #% I find worrying the noises the Americans are now making in this respect and I believe they are trying to move the goalposts regarding farming . #% There have been so many genocides in the past 100 years and each time we say it will never happen again . #% In the last two weeks , two former high ranking officials in Ireland 's biggest bank have been arrested in dawn raids . #% I am happy as long as we indicate a preference in timing while being realistic enough to realise that we do not control all the possibilities . #% Pre-term birth is the number one cause of infant death and premature babies are far more likely to develop lifelong chronic illnesses . #% It is essential that the Intergovernmental Conference is not allowed to withdraw into the shadows . #% Who could have forecast that in the second half of that century all those countries would be together or that we would be all together as we are today ? #% Equally , it is important that there is an intensification of support for employment initiatives in urban and rural blackspots . #% Secondly , we also have a duty to ensure that the working environment and the ability to compete and to get a job within our Community is also made available and is as accessible as possible . #% Care for the frail and elderly is a challenge that faces us all and unfortunately it is one that we will probably all face ourselves at some stage in our lives . #% Traditional herbal medicines have been used in our societies from the earliest times . #% We will only succeed , however , if we are committed in the short term to supporting the European model based on family farming . #% Similarly I am opposed to the notion of creating human life for the sole purpose of harvesting tissues , after which this human life is to be disposed of . #% Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment , when we need sugar production more than ever . #% We have also learned a lot in the last year in relation to new variant CJD and that patients with a distinct genetic makeup are prone to it , not the entire population . #% The report is firm on keeping the policy an EU one , rejecting attempts to re-nationalise it . #% These laws protected basic trade union rights and their removal is a very worrying development . #% There is considerable potential in rational use of energy ; if research into renewable energy had been funded at the same rate as nuclear energy has been over the last 40 years , we would be in a very different position . #% 
The first priority - the plight of the unemployed - is also our first priority . #% Well , the donkey has various traits - one of which we know is stubbornness . #% Groups representing the food industry , farm organisations and consumer interests are all actively involved in the implementation of these directives and regulations . #% It is important , when we are placing so much emphasis on one aspect of increasing education qualifications and increasing the opportunities for lifelong learning , that we provide a proper regulatory framework for employment creation in that area . #% This concept originated in the US in 1957 as a method of investigating the non-military uses of nuclear explosives . #% You may believe that if the Constitution were adopted during the Irish presidency , it would have a better chance of success in an Irish referendum . #% As you said , the solution must be lasting , fair and legally viable . #% I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues . #% For this reason , and for many years , my group has been calling for a greater involvement of fishermen in the ways the common fishery policy is run . #% Mr President , waste management is now central to achieving the highest standards of environmental protection . #% The current situation where creditors alone decide on how to deal with unpayable debt is clearly inappropriate and to date this has failed to resolve the decades long debt crisis . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I would like to say to Klaus Hänsch , as his twoand-a-half year term of office comes towards and end , that we believe that he has conducted the business of this House firmly but with great fairness . #% I agree with those who have called for Parliament to be further involved by way of co-decision rather than just being consulted on an issue which is of such great importance to our citizens . #% Local communities have to live with that and , in some areas , even farming has been affected because the mining companies leave their mess behind , affecting not just the water supplies but also the land in general . #% The cooperative sector has been waiting 30 years for this legislation , because of the extremely diverse nature of this sector . #% With regard to the financial perspective , the present one which runs from 1993 to 1999 was accompanied by an increase in the EU budget ceiling to 1.27 % of EU GNP . #% Indeed , the international community should show commitment exceeding that shown to tackle the financial crisis . #% Ninety per cent of our total beef production and 80 % of our milk production is exported . #% Many of our citizens are asking this now . #% It was sensible to remove the prescriptive obligation for mandatory audit committees and replace it with a proposal to assign those functions to a body that meets audit standards and objectives and can implement the requirements in a transparent way . #% However , this may not be at the expense of rank-and-file workers in the Commission , as was suggested in Paragraph 81 . #% So I welcome the proposals put forward by Mr Chanterie to try to bring some regulation and flexibility into that sector . #% We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens . #% We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments , which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere . #% Violence against women exists everywhere and among all classes , rich and poor , educated and uneducated , the socially mobile and the marginalised , but a widespread and structural blindness to this problem has persisted . #% On top of that , as already mentioned by Malcolm Harbour , there is the question of disabled access . #% A total of EUR 5 billion is out on loans at the moment . #% It is vital that the Irish Box is maintained as a biologically sensitive zone . #% Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems . #% The European Union is determined to play its part in reaching our targeted 8 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels over this decade . #% For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago . #% I pose the question , and not for the first time , what happens following decoupling if the projected price increase in the market place does not materialise ? #% Do you know the numbers of Community citizens travelling outside the Community as against the number of Community citizens travelling within the Community on a regular basis ? #% We can not aspire to a social inclusion process and produce lots and lots of documents outlining how to achieve it if , at the same time , we do not ensure that this process is mainstreamed in our initiatives . #% Unfortunately , we seem to be no closer to resolving this murder . #% Mr President , I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate this evening . #% 55 percent of all our milk is processed as skimmed milk . #% The attention of European legislators must also focus on the need to secure more financial resources for greater medical research into cancer prevention and into the health consequences of passive smoking . #% I believe we should use the existing established structures of the special beef premium and suckler cow grants , both of which are part of the agreed CAP framework , as a means of determining the shareout of the additional funds between Member States while at the same time allowing individual governments to decide how best the package can be applied to each sector . #% However , we have a moral obligation to draw attention to this situation and we have to stand up and be counted on an issue as important as this . #% That is disgraceful . #% Ireland had , until recently , a very active National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism ( NCCRI ) and a well funded Equality Authority . #% At the same time , we continue to adopt a cavalier approach towards the biodiversity of less developed countries through this trade , even though there is a ban for the moment . #% Unfortunately this government has had many friends in this Parliament over the years and many EU governments have put the profits of their arms industries above those of the basic human rights of the unfortunate people of East Timor . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , for her excellent report and , more importantly , her consistent and energetic efforts to achieve a consensus on the Community patent in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal market . #% I feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties . #% Since 1985 there has been a provision in the technical measures regulation to allow Member States to impose stricter measures for their own fishermen in EU waters . #% It is certainly worth saying that , when the ILO was created in 1919 after the Treaty of Versailles , which ended the First World War , it was to reflect the belief that universal and lasting peace can only be accomplished if it is based on social justice . #% EU governments fully recognise that the development of the European economy can not be achieved unless we take full advantage of new and evolving information technologies . #% The ultimate goal of Union sought by the overwhelming majority of Member States can not be held to ransom indefinitely . #% Then there is the complex question of vaccination , even if it is not on the Irish agenda . #% They are angry and frustrated at the sclerosis that exists in the decision-making processes of the European Union and indeed the United Nations . #% The EU must establish a legal framework to enable action at other levels . #% That payment has to be made by the end of the year . #% Secondly , the price reductions should be significantly less than what is currently proposed and implemented more gradually . #% Up to 24 000 people in my country die prematurely each year due to this major hazard . #% It follows from this paragraph that a decision not to impose water charges would be in breach of the Directive if it can be linked to the Irish Government 's failure to meet the new standards . #% In certain cases it is also where child abuse takes place and we know that children have been abused in schools and institutions . #% No Member State on its own can effectively resolve the problems of air traffic control or safety in the air . #% Indonesia itself must facilitate the work of relief agencies and the international forces so as to ensure that peace and stability return to the area . #% I fully supported the text as adopted by the Council . #% I believe the response of the EU in Geneva was appalling . #% An enlarged Union will be able to play a more positive and influential role internationally , both politically and economically . #% It happens - and this is a new dimension to our relationship with these countries - that the three prisoners I mentioned have relations in Ireland and , because of the interaction between voluntary organisations in Ireland and Kosovo , pressure is being put on me as an MEP to find a solution to this problem . #% Can the Commission encourage the removal of those older animals ? #% We intend to remain vigilant at all times so as to guarantee that confidence in the European food chain is fully restored , sooner rather than later . #% 
This legislation will reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed by pesticides and is aimed at halving the quantities used within a decade . #% The consumers do not want GM food , so why are we being forced into it just for the benefit of multinational companies ? #% Article 175 will also allow those Member States which already have more ambitious legislation in force as part of their Kyoto strategy to keep that legislation where it is appropriate for the functioning of the internal market and not , as would be the case with the current common position , force them to bring their environmental standards down to lower EU levels . #% That is a very serious topic and we need to be properly informed on such research within the boundaries of the European Union . #% We will also recognise and appreciate in the future the stronger and greater links that you have established with the applicant countries , helping to foster democratic and parliamentary values there . #% It is deplorable that our own government is trying to force people to change their minds . #% There is , however , one important bridge to be crossed if this desired objective is to be achieved . #% I welcome the Ombudsman 's suggestion that there be a much closer working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman 's office with regard to the legal implications of some of the cases that come before us . #% Perfluorooctane sulfonates - PFOS - are chlorinated compounds with numerous applications in consumer products such as textiles and paper , are known for their repellent properties , amongst others , and are used daily in many consumer products . #% Their role in society is not always sufficiently recognized , in particular at a time when reward for work is generally measured in terms of money . #% Do the people know that they have lost their power ? #% We must work incessantly to convince our own consumers and customers in exports markets that our beef is safe and wholesome . #% I can say , however , that this whole area is being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference . #% I like the reference to Star Trek in the ` boldly go ' . #% For the ill-informed it was an eye-opener as to current human rights abuses , restrictions of freedoms and political and religious repression , with different accounts coming from each country . #% My other points concerns the motion for a resolution . #% Mr President , in conjunction with the other speakers , I wish to congratulate Mr Burtone on the tremendous work he has done on this report . #% Legislation to take this on board is vital in Member States . #% People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable . #% For 42 stocks it set TACs that were more than 10 % higher than the Commission 's proposal . #% We must all work together . #% It is emerging as a huge barrier to investment and the government is doing very little to remedy this situation , apart from giving endless employment to consultants . #% Now , both the European and Canadian transnational corporations want to break into the provision of public services in Canada - on a maximisation-of-profit basis , of course . #% Indeed , why has Ireland not ratified the Europol Convention and why are we not fully participating in it ? #% I am sure work on other strategic issues is ongoing . #% I take this opportunity to warn the Irish Government that it is following a very dangerous path . #% The truth is , and we have got to face it , Saddam Hussein has effectively made fools out of the international community ever since that time . #% The death penalty , children 's rights -- and , in particular , children in armed conflict -- women 's rights and gender equality , the role of international business in human rights , human rights in the fight against terrorism and the role of the ICC in the fight against impunity are all issues that need to be given continued priority by consecutive Council presidencies and the Commission . #% In the past , too many Member States have paid lip-service to the idea , but where there is a choice between trade and defence of human rights , economic self-interest has always taken precedence . #% I would like to see that broadened to include those representing the development area . #% in writing . - This is a very pertinent issue , and I strongly support the group line in focusing on Early Years Learning . #% We are in a situation in Europe at the moment where we are pouring millions of euros into the agricultural industry , yet the farmers have never been worse off in their lives . #% You have been an outstanding representative of this House who has earned the thanks and support of everyone here . #% In conclusion , while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER + , I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme . #% Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject . #% The General Affairs Council , as Mr Poos says , must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper . #% I would like sincerely to thank the Council for its understanding on this significant point . #% Finally , I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7 , which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work , with the support of Eurostat . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as I agree with the fundamental point that there should be ` transition ' regulation in this sector . #% I strongly support the rapporteur 's idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy . #% Broadband , in my view , is just as essential as electricity to rural regions , and yet many parts of rural Europe do not have this basic facility . #% There are many Member States within the European Union which are not involved in the arms industry and do not want to be involved in the arms industry . #% She has made considerable progress . #% We must encourage the public to donate blood . #% Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness , but we need to acknowledge and recognise , as the Commissioner has made clear , that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice . #% The common good that the authority of the State serves is only as strong as the certainty in the minds of its citizens that their rights are protected and their responsibilities are clear . #% We need at least 2.5 % ; that is attainable . #% We should look at modifying and solidifying those tachograph requirements . #% Many citizens will not accept this as the constitution of the EU and if referenda are held , as they must be in some states , I believe there will be no majority for a constitution promoting nuclear technology . #% Unfortunately , with the European Constitutional Treaty not moving as some of us would have hoped , our competence is fairly limited . #% I am very pleased that the Commission has raised the human rights question with the Vietnamese authorities and I should like an assurance today from Commissioner Van den Broek that , on behalf of the Commission , he will maintain this approach . #% I wish the authorities could do something about the fact that we still have a landfill site in Rogerstown estuary in north County Dublin , in an area which is a natural habitat for wild birds and so on . #% The report goes to great lengths to push these kinds of dangers under the carpet . #% We also see that huge death duties accrue to partners who have bought houses together where , on the death of one partner , the other is faced with a massive tax bill , very often resulting in that person having to sell what was , in the truest sense of the word , a family home . #% They have allowed thousands of illegal dumps right across Europe , including in Ireland . #% It is true that we had a very successful changeover programme but , more importantly , we have 4 % unemployment , less than half the EU average , and our economic growth is approaching 6 % , three times the EU average . #% So why generate a battle about some EUR 300 million that , in the end , I do not think that we will have to call down from agriculture ? #% It is questionable whether it is acceptable that a Member of this Parliament be paid more than , for example , the president of his own country , which could happen in certain cases . #% But we have to remember that we can not finance a meaningful regional policy for the new Europe out of the present budgetary resources . #% Now the question asks how the EU Commission evaluates whether the states that benefit from preferential trade agreements with the EU protect workers ' rights and protect human rights . #% What is the situation regarding our immunity ? #% Finally , with the Internet now being presented to us , we must ensure that this resource is tapped for the greater good not for exclusivity . #% All the institutions of the Union , as the budget increased , tended to participate in the creation of regulations which did not facilitate the best and the most efficient distribution of the resources which were at our disposal . #% Whereas we are denied import quotas , China 's state owned factories benefit from export subsidies , state aid and even free electricity , as well as the benefits of its artificially undervalued currency . #% Mr President , I am pleased to announce that in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy this evening the last piece of the jigsaw , Mr Clegg 's package , was voted through unanimously . #% I am therefore pleased that one of the important declarations at the Summit confirmed that there would be a safeguard clause on food safety included in each of the accession treaties . #% 
Mr President , we should remind colleagues who may not be here for the formal sitting that the vote on the calendar for next year takes place at 12.30 p.m. , so everybody should be back and not caught offside . #% On tobacco I wish to support compromise Amendment No 20 , on the need to look at the automatic trigger . #% There is , however , a need for continued detailed debate on one issue in particular , a CCCTB . #% His commitment to keeping his message simple , human and , above all , relevant , is also greatly to be welcomed , because if we do not do this , and include the citizens in our programmes , the vital survival of this Community will be at risk . #% I had hoped that Commissioner McCreevy here today would have demonstrated that he had understood that message , but unfortunately his remarks with regard to services of general economic interest do not encourage me to believe that he has . #% Respecting your request , I understand that the Commission is undertaking a report on commercial and retail activities in US airports . #% Many years ago , a greater Irishman than I am said , ` Nobody or no group has the right to put a stop on the march of a nation ' . #% The European Parliament should work closely with the US Congress to stiffen the backbone and resolve both of the European governments and of the current US administration . #% When we talk in Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation about trying to help developing countries , it has been recognised that cancelling the debt would be one of the most sensible ways of ensuring that we can actually help these countries . #% I want to add my voice to those who congratulated Mr Mulder , the chairman of the committee , Mrs Schreyer and the expertise that we have all around us . #% The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations . #% It is important to get the message across to European citizens that we are all beneficiaries of the European model of farming . #% I do not share that approach , as I believe that the internal market laws should be the responsibility of Commission officials as part of the discipline of effective policy-making . #% With regard to the question of whether an institutional agreement or an article in a proposed treaty or Constitution is the best place for this , I personally have not made up my mind on that point . #% Perhaps we were a year too early , because this would have allowed us to show a dramatic improvement in meeting all targets and timetables - I am being somewhat sarcastic but it is a serious point . #% However , the discharge of Tritium from the BNFL Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria and Chapelcross Nuclear Power Station , to mention only one discharge , is extremely large - millions of litres of tritiated water and air every year . #% Mr President , Ireland is the only country in Europe in which driftnet fishing of wild Atlantic salmon is allowed . #% Some trade restrictions are acceptable in view of the social environmental problems that are so obvious . #% Here no clear decision has been taken about what should be done : the site of a nuclear power station has not been returned to a state in which it can be used for other purposes , and we have a legacy of nuclear waste which will stay in the mountain for a long time . #% Mr President , the current Russian crisis has profound economic and political implications for the country itself , the region and wider geopolitics . #% The research stated that residents within three kilometres of a landfill site were associated with a significantly higher risk of congenital anomalies and that systematic environmental health surveillance is needed for municipal landfill sites and other pollution sources . #% Any further delay would rightly be regarded as political . #% There is an old saying in the media that if it bleeds , it leads ; the more dramatic the image , the better chance it has of making the headlines . #% Today , the UK Chancellor is outlining drastic public sector cuts - cuts that the EU have urged Member States to make . #% Clearly -- and he acknowledges this himself -- it is the Commission that is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law , including international agreements concluded by the Community and , therefore , the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement . #% But it shows that , when Parliament stands together , when the different groups do not allow themselves to be divided and are determined not to give away the powers of this House , we can , with the other institutions , come up with a very good instrument and one that ensures that the prerogatives of this House are protected . #% In particular I refer to the tradition in the common agricultural policy of applying premiums to male animals only . #% This need is also a result of the establishment of OLAF and indeed the fact that , quite shortly , we are hopefully going to ratify a constitution which contains a charter of citizens ' rights and which will clearly enhance the role of the citizen in Europe . #% I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office 's positive remarks in that regard . #% I would also like to draw attention to the regrettable situation that has developed there . #% The URBAN initiative is a small programme with a big impact . #% As far as energy from renewable energy sources is concerned , every foresight programme undertaken , including that in the UK , has identified this sector as being of tremendous importance , including wind energy , photovoltaic energy and , of course , biomass . #% Mr President , pursuant to Rules 127 and 108 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament I wish to beg the indulgence of yourself and the House , if possible , to clarify remarks which I made this morning . #% I understand that off-road vehicles account for about 8.5 % of the diesel vehicles in the European Union . #% We need to work more closely together to combat the scourge of human trafficking . #% We need a permanent solution . #% Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor . #% Without prejudice to the question of substance - the abolition of duty-free - the call for a study remains as valid today as it was before , and I renew it now . #% Rather than trying to construct a new consensus , as Mr Barroso suggested last week , we should concentrate on strengthening the current European consensus on competitive markets , fiscal discipline and hard currency . #% In his New Year message , speaking to his own people in his own state , he set out as one of his three objectives to work for the creation of a federal Europe . #% It is an unfortunate fact of our life in this world today that many hundreds of journalists die virtually every year in pursuit of their vocation of serving and informing the public . #% Undoubtedly , the European Council , representing the fifteen governments , will have to reform its structures . #% It is for this reason that I really welcome last week 's decision by the Commission . #% It is quite clear that smoking is a danger to health . #% The turnaround has been dramatic and there have been few complaints . #% The importance of containing spending and being careful has nothing to do with denying the needs of the Community in so far as budgetary resources are concerned . #% INTAS is the only pan-European , EU-funded programme dedicated to scientific cooperation with the NIS countries , including involving the scientific community in Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% To conclude , I repeat what I said to the Commission last July when the mid-term review proposals were made and again when the legislative proposals were made last month : the combined effects of the prospect of greatly liberalised agricultural trade under the WTO and the Commission proposals for major reform of the common agricultural policy are potentially devastating for European agriculture . #% It was never a possibility , considering the detail and the complications of this regulation , that our objectives for spending in the year 2000 could be achieved . #% The gender pay gap - 17.4 % - has barely narrowed since 2000 . #% They have been causing pollution for such a long , long time the length of our coast by polluting the Irish Sea and putting the public in Ireland , and indeed on the west coast of the United Kingdom , at serious risk . #% Mr President , can I make clear that the Socialist Group wants the words `` free , fair and socially-balanced '' included . #% I am convinced that a united European Union could have stopped this war , could have disarmed Saddam Hussein , and indeed could have played an important role in bringing peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians . #% I welcome the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection 's support for the polluter pays principle and the proposal for a tax on waste going into the landfill sites . #% We are equally aware of the discrepancy between the EU audiovisual market size and the position of EU productions within that market . #% In fact I understand that the UK Government is only wanting ECU 51 million of that , therefore not taking up ECU 175.304 million . #% Mr President , I want first of all to welcome Giorgos Katiforis ' s report . #% Then we will be in the same situation as with the tobacco companies where millions could be paid out to people whose health has been put in danger . #% However , several studies have revealed the long-term limitations of this arrangement . #% That has to be a cause for concern in terms of misleading consumers . #% I am confident that the Irish presidency will work hard to secure an agreement capable of winning the support of all the peoples of the European Union , in which all citizens and all Member States have equal rights , there is no second-class membership and we all make progress together . #% I especially want to thank the staff of our own Committee on Budgetary Control who were most diligent and expert and generous with their time , despite being moved around a lot recently , which is not very helpful . #% Mr President , congratulations to Mr Marset Campos , not least for his patience and persistence with this report . #% Look at all the expertise that is involved in this job and I genuinely mean ` expertise ' of our assistants in our Groups , the staff of the committee and the Commission and the experts in the Council of Ministers . #% It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach . #% I look forward to working with my colleagues to do what I can for the people of Haiti . #% 
All policies are interdependent and no economy should have a higher rate of dependency on any one energy source and no amount of increase or decrease in the interest rate can change that fact . #% We know the emotional pain and human tragedy that resulted , largely because of the controversy about vaccination . #% However , in Ireland we refuse to be cast in the role of villain because of one or two high-profile relocations in recent years . #% Again , this is a serious matter for consideration by the governments of the Member States , and finance for these measures would be a good investment on the part of the EU . #% We need to ensure that the rights of such people can be carried across borders . #% We are , therefore , in a new situation and it is misleading and incorrect to say there is no money to resolve it . #% These fears must be addressed as must also the wish to see the introduction of an accelerated timetable for the introduction of universal suffrage . #% - Commissioner Byrne , at his hearing stated that : the future of public health policies should not be linked only to the present crisis of the day ; that there must be a high level of human health protection in all Community policies ; that we must be proactive in public healthcare . #% In my constituency of Northern Ireland , 98 % of all companies can be classified as SMEs . #% This is an extremely important matter for this Parliament , which is concerned because the European Union provides Guarantee Funds to the EIB . #% As we inevitably wind down some of the supports in the process of enlargement and , at the same time , maintain the pressures to protect the environment and the consumers , then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration . #% Whereas the European Commission has called for graduated taxes designed to penalise carbon dioxide emissions , the European Parliament calls for the focus to cover all pollutants and fuel efficiency . #% President Bush 's decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational . #% In many cases I do not believe that we have a guarantee that the money has gone where we expect it to go . #% This includes the areas of TACs , managing effort through days at sea -- based on stocks size consistent with the precautionary principle -- and of course Chapter 4 , which most importantly deals with measures to police , monitor , inspect and survey the effort management system . #% Therefore , the report calls on the Commission to present , as soon as possible , a detailed communication on children 's rights , linking the issue with EU development policy . #% As well as the ethical question of mass-medicating members of the public , who do not want fluoridation in their tap water , could you comment on the ethical and infant-related issues ? #% I welcome the issues highlighted by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll in their respective reports . #% Mr President , the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely . #% For the record , Raytheon , a high-tech software plant to which the amendments are directed , is to be funded by the IDB , the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland , not the IFI . #% What hope have the poor and working people outside the borders of Europe in view of that situation ? #% I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended . #% I say to Commissioner Papoutsis that we know he has a strong and sincere commitment to renewable energy . #% In 2002 alone seizure of such goods doubled in the European Union . #% That is why it is essential that we protect and maintain the some EUR 1.7 billion which Ireland annually receives under the CAP . #% The EU , which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation , is now being militarised . #% Mr President , I wish to acknowledge the Commission decision to provide ECU 650 million compensation package for farmers who have and still do experience serious financial losses resulting from BSE . #% If our GNP goes down a percentage , our contribution to these people also goes down . #% Would he agree that rural tourism requires additional funding under the proposed new operational programme for tourism ? #% It was adopted unanimously by our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and it provides us with a very useful argument in favour of economic and social development . #% In fact the dose could be 12 times more dangerous for children according to the recent study . #% The dead included a four-year old boy , a ten-year old girl and a sixteen-year old boy . #% It is important for the more stringent set of rules to apply to the provision of services for sectoral regimes . #% Violence has only resulted in an intensification of hatred and recriminations between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples . #% Had the Commission been as good as its word , such a study and its consequences would long since have been dealt with . #% Such a concern is misplaced . #% . I voted today against the EC-Morocco Partnership Agreement on fisheries because I am not satisfied that all steps were taken in respect of this agreement , which could and should have been taken to protect the sovereignty and rights of Western Sahara . #% However , when you look more closely at the scientific and empirical data available on bird flu , you see certain trends emerging . #% It was with some regret then that one noticed that , if there was a delay , it was among your ` line managers ' from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers . #% He must see the clear link between the necessary loan and aid packages , which are vital to the country 's economic well-being , and the democratic and constitutional reforms which we all expect of him . #% I wonder if # 150 , 000 is the prop that keeps the Referendum Party represented in a group in this Parliament by Mr Nicholson ? #% Taking traffic straight off roads and on to the railway can only be good for the future . #% President-in-Office , I want to support the initiative of my colleague , Mr Hindley , and the remarks of my colleague , Mr Newens . #% I feel , however , that we should be consistent here with other accession reports . #% in writing . - The reality is that this proposal will have a disproportionate impact upon the peripheral Member States in the European Union , such as Ireland , as centrally located Member States have the option of switching to rail . #% - At the outset , I would like to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur Mr Lehne on the way he had dealt with this difficult brief . #% As for agriculture , we know that this is an industry which needs all the help it can get in both parts of Ireland . #% Those who do not believe in the federal Union foreseen by our Founding Fathers must consider whether they are entitled to bring this movement to a halt and ultimate collapse or whether they themselves should go . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , I should like to begin by congratulating the Prime Minister and his colleagues on a successful presidency . #% Whilst I voted in favour of the report and the decision to refuse to grant a budget discharge for 2008 , this is the first time that a discharge has been used against an individual organisation . #% We need clear implementation of good , humane laws and we will all benefit from them . #% Studies on gender-based violence estimate that 20-25 % of all women in Europe have experienced physical acts of violence at least once during their adult lives . #% in writing . - Men 's violence against women is a violation of women 's human rights which both reflects and reinforces inequalities between men and women . #% Mr President , the fisheries industry in crisis - we have heard it all before . #% I welcome the Ombudsman 's initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future . #% I would ask the Commission and the Council to listen to this united voice and to adopt ` European Food Safety Authority ' as the title of the institution . #% It is especially important to monitor , and act on , the gender dimension of poverty , violence and the needs of girl-children . #% The Hatzidakis report and the Commission proposals prove that the Jeremiahs who say that enlargement is bad news for UK regions have got it wrong . #% The reality is a picture of widening disparities in regional unemployment in Europe . #% Serious clarifications must be given by the US Government to the issues that have been raised . #% However , it is a package and there can be no cherrypicking by anyone - the choice is either to accept the package in total or to reject it . #% Keeping the word ` safety ' in the title of the authority will give a clear signal to consumers as to its purpose and goals . #% Even more importantly , the failure of Sinn Féin 's leadership to ensure that justice is done in this case undermines the cause of Irish Republicanism . #% Mr President , I wish to ask the Commissioner how the European Union can so confidently in the preliminary negotiations for Kyoto offer the reductions that they have done and although we have heard this evening how important these targets are - 7.5 % by the year 2005 and 15 % by 2010 - how can we achieve them ? #% The effects of the full battle between the voluntary cooperation of the European sovereign states and the dictatorial incorporation of those states into the European superstate have yet to be witnessed . #% For some time now this institution has been under hostile attack in some Member States - not on the basis of policies which Parliament is pursuing , but rather in the form of outlandish insinuations about the internal administration of Parliament . #% 
We need to have a real evaluation of what success the past cuts have had and what information is available to be examined . #% An ILO mission in February was denied access to Aung San Suu Kyi , and the UN Special Envoy strongly criticised the slow progress of dialogue . #% Innovation is the very key , the very engine that will drive our economies . #% At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October , Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey . #% An Alzheimer 's action programme would be of enormous benefit to the many thousands of Europeans suffering from this disease . #% Mr President , if the overall social human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured , then the standards laid down by the EU 's recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% The amendment related to Budget line A-3015 which is used to finance the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages . #% I welcome this Commission . #% The main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ? #% Our ultimate aim has to be the reduction of these unwanted by-catches and the virtual elimination of discards through a discard ban , with incentives in place to ensure that all unwanted by-catch must be landed . #% My call in this House is that across Europe , under the aegis of each nation-state , organised crime should be relentlessly pursued . #% Dennis Halliday , who resigned from his position as director of the UN humanitarian mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions , confirms the UNICEF statistics - five to six thousand children die every month as a direct result of the sanctions . #% Furthermore , how can Yasser Arafat exert any authority when he is humiliated in this way by Ariel Sharon ? #% This relates to the facility that MEPs have to sign on a register on a Friday so that they are enabled to claim their allowances for accommodation on a Thursday night when they participate in votes on a Thursday afternoon and are unable to fly home . #% It is a very finely balanced question which is a very genuine one and a very important one . #% There is no doubt about any of that , but there is much room to doubt the worth of the Commission 's response . #% Parliament should support what the Environment Committee is putting forward . #% The core elements and goals are still as valid today as they were when it was first agreed : to make Europe the most dynamic and innovative economy in the world by 2010 . #% The CAP accounts for almost half of the EU budget and it is only correct that every euro spent should be accounted for . #% We are coming up with a programme which highlights key areas for research but at the same time expresses the wishes of the citizens of Europe for scourges like cancer and other illnesses and for environmental dangers to be combated with intelligence . #% Last week in Northern Ireland the forces of the state capitulated in the face of lawlessness . #% But we should not just consider our need for healthcare , but the needs of those who deliver it . #% I should like to propose that to Members as a technical amendment . #% The specific point that I raised in my question , which I thought would be self-evident , was that because of sudden downturns in the economy in America and other parts of the world , there is increasing pressure being put on small and medium-sized enterprises in a very strict and rigorously competitive market . #% Of course , this is nothing new . #% My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks , but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the unpredictability of political life . #% Yesterday due to the constraints of time , it was not possible for all of us who wanted to speak to speak . #% This report emphasizes the importance of space , the need for support from public funds - commercial interests will be totally inadequate - and the real added value that comes from European Union work . #% It must be flexible and market based . #% We have long argued for the development of research in clinical methods in the fight against HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries . #% Mr President , my Group voted against this report because we feel that this issue has been pushed and promoted by the arms industry . #% I was fortunate that this was my experience in Sri Lanka . #% Quite frequently they do not remember or think about the role that cohesion policy has . #% Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is right to say it is not just quantitative , it is qualitative much more than growth . #% The SAVE I programme was very small beer , a very small amount of money . #% Will the presidency back Parliament 's demands in the Council for a strengthened partnership pact , and what concrete and practical actions will the presidency take to ensure that partnership is not just an optional extra but an integral component of all programmes , strengthening the cohesion of a People 's Europe ? #% We know of a recent victim . #% The recent change in government in Turkey in no way alters my view . #% Studies in my country have established a statistically robust cause-effect link between eutrophication , or algal bloom , which has an enormous detrimental effect on water quality and aquatic ecosystems , and phosphorous concentration . #% Citizens have paid twice , with costs of a taxpayer bailout followed by the pain of recession and spending cuts . #% The EU , as one of the most important regions from all these points of view , clearly has a special responsibility . #% Our now costly emergency plan to restore consumption and consumer confidence calls for 100 % participation by each Member State . #% I also thank Ms Malone for her good wishes . #% in writing . - I voted against the report on the integrity of online gambling as I believe the alternative motion , which was rejected by the plenary , would have better reflected the up-to-date position in the online gambling sector . #% I ask the Commissioner to do something about that urgently or all this legislation -- framework directives , water directives and so on -- will come to nought . #% At the end of the day , the GMO industry does not have anything to offer the consumer or the environment , even as regards the use of chemicals . #% Finally , the danger now is that agreement at the IGC will be much more difficult to achieve because of the antiEuropean forces unleased in the United Kingdom . #% As we face a mid-term review of the Berlin agreement and the inevitable long term CAP reform , we must not allow the review to deviate from what was agreed in Berlin or to contemplate a move towards re-nationalisation of CAP in future reform . #% I commend Mr Fox on his work to at least bring some modicum of common sense in 2012 and 2013 . #% I would like to thank Parliament for its assistance in this matter . #% The UK 's Anti-Counterfeiting Group has estimated that as many as 4 000 people lose their jobs as a result of this trade and that the GBP 1.75 billion lost in VAT alone could build four new hospitals a year . #% With the creation of the single market it is now basically up to Brussels to control everything : indirect taxation , national budgets , interest rates and corporate tax . #% The highest priority must be given by the industry throughout the European Union to the attainment of best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance , as is currently the case in Ireland . #% She is in a secure psychiatric mother and baby unit in England , and it seems to me that if the decent English people who fought hard for the release of Louise Woodward were to consider the inequity of the imprisonment of this young woman on very flimsy evidence , they would call on their government for her release . #% On top of that , there is also a necessity for us to make sure , once the legislation is passed at a European level , that the Member States strictly enforce the legislation and open up the opportunities that are available . #% We believed Parliament 's amendments unnecessarily watered down something which is a deeply sensitive political issue on the road towards EMU . #% We have come a long way towards achieving this . #% Let us take the reform of the sugar sector , for example . #% Forty per cent of travellers in my own country , Ireland , do not bother to use packages , and I know this is replicated in many other Member States . #% We are trying to work with the problems that all this creates . #% We need to remember that the well-established groups were once small too . #% This is a fundamental right given to each citizen of the European Union . #% I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group . #% I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard . #% Clearly Father Shay Cullen 's campaign against this vicious tourism , which Parliament has condemned many times , is causing considerable worry to the powerful and corrupt circle in the city in which he is campaigning . #% You simply can not get public access to the information , and this is something which is essential for small enterprises . #% 
Countries that have serious internal hostilities and all the terrible reaping of that where the innocent go to the wall and countries encouraging displaced persons to return home ought to be helped . #% The UK authorities argue that in spite of ethical doubts the cloning of human embryos is necessary because it is the only way to help patients suffering from various diseases . #% You passed over my Question 39 . #% It has been reported that Israel is now demanding that the European Union stop giving financial assistance to Human Rights Organisations operating in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories . #% In some parts there are very high levels of unemployment , maybe as high as 75 % . #% It is of the utmost importance that consumer information campaigns about the timetable and effects of the new euro currency continue in the run-up to the introduction of euro notes and coins in the year 2002 . #% In fisheries , the policy always seems to be about reducing the catch . #% Madam President , firstly I should to thank the Belgian government for outlining in its legislative agenda the priorities it intends to pursue during its six month presidency of the Union . #% I fully support the right of junior doctors and doctors in training to secure the benefits of this directive , but the Conciliation Committee conclusions will have reluctantly to be accepted . #% Still students are encountering financial problems while studying abroad . #% Our response in Ireland , from what I know of other EU countries , tends to be slow and ungenerous . #% Those who have had reservations on enlargement in the past should realise that not only have their particular concerns been misplaced but the current crisis is in fact an argument for accelerating the agenda for enlargement . #% Mr President , the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed leaders , like Musa Hilal , seem singularly immune to Western criticism . #% Unfortunately , there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of Tamils in Sri Lanka . #% Thirdly , we are in favour of ensuring that we can give the best education and the best tools of knowledge to our young people to guarantee that they can make informed decisions about their own personal lifestyle . #% It is far more important to obtain a good result than an early result . #% The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue . #% Mr President , ten years ago over two million children were exposed to the fall-out from Chernobyl . #% The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 . #% That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports . #% I grew up in Northern Ireland in the shadow of violence , terrorism and intimidation . #% In Parliament , as you probably know , we are currently considering a protocol to extend the EU-ASEAN Agreement to Vietnam . #% This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union . #% I support the legislation , but before welcoming the compromise package agreed between the representatives of the European Parliament and the Council , which goes further by extending the ban of concentration in toys and childcare articles to children in general -- as opposed to the original wording referring to children under three years of age -- we must first obtain clarification as to the exact nature of the risk posed by DINP , DIDP and DNOP to children . #% She has rightly insisted on the need to enforce the welfare rules which are already in place . #% It is quite clear today that this is going happen and there needs to be a bit more honesty with the people . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Taoiseach , Mr Bertie Ahern , and his colleagues here today . #% I welcome proposals for network access for renewable energies . #% My point directly follows on from Mrs Eriksson 's . #% However , particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland , whose prosperity and employment levels depend , to a large extent , on its capacity to attract foreign investment . #% The reaffirmation of this commitment at Liège will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations . #% I also wish to thank the President of the Commission for his contribution and to say that my group will strongly support the main thrust of what the Commission President said here today . #% He had the right to intervene and I regret that he was not facilitated as others were . #% Who better to be President of Ireland than Mrs Banotti , who has worked for that in this House and who is the best placed to build bridges in Ireland itself and sweep away old enmities ? #% EQUAL stands for `` equality '' . #% In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways . #% This is contrary to the views of the British Royal Society , which finds that the scientific case has not been made . #% I am very concerned about the threat to combined heat and power in the gas directive . #% For me the issue of general-interest services -- both economic and non-economic -- is a line in the sand between those who favour a social market economy model and those who favour a neo-liberal market economy . #% Changing the essential balance between human activity and our environment led to the loss of this precious ecosystem . #% Yesterday evening after the votes in the Chamber , a comment was made which I would like to distance myself from and not to be associated with . #% We could use solar energy to heat our houses , if we so wished . #% There is a long litany of incidents and disputes . #% As I found out when I was rapporteur on the report for the same subject for 1994 , the level of surveillance and control of EU vessels varies widely from one country to another , but nowhere at all is it satisfactory . #% I can confirm that the Council recently received a Commission proposal for a set of measures in the beef sector on which the European Parliament has been consulted . #% If we are now going to insist on country of origin for mince , why can not we have country of origin for the larger pieces of beef from 1 September , or whenever ? #% I wonder if the fact that you did not have enough resources at your disposal has anything to do with the report that was published yesterday by the Court of Auditors , which says that a lot of work is being impeded by people being on short-term contracts . #% Turning to the Irish presidency , I am sure that Mr Ahern will remember my illustrious predecessor telling him six months ago in this House , with characteristic humour , that the most beneficial thing likely to emerge from the Irish presidency would be that Mr Ahern would have less time to meddle in the affairs of British Northern Ireland . #% As such , I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP ; to supporting small - and medium-sized food producers ; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture . #% I want to stress that the publication of the Green Paper on sustainable energy in Ireland should be viewed as a positive contribution to the debate on how we deal with climate change threat within the energy sector . #% We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories , indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement . #% In fact , the draft changes would deepen the European Union 's relationship with the nuclear armed Western European Union and pave the way for the eventual merger between the two bodies . #% There may be various explanations of a technical sort and I should be interested if so , to hear them . #% Employment in both the food and tourism sector is dependent on our quality image . #% Turkey is currently applying for membership of the EU and I support that move , but part of that process will have to be a requirement that major companies like Gama respect and protect workers ' rights within the EU . #% My group , the EPP group , can only note the result of the Berlin Summit and while it is a significant improvement on the original Commission proposal it falls far short of what is needed by producers . #% Disaster risk reduction needs to be fully integrated into policies for development aid and humanitarian aid . #% This right to determine , to control , to have any say about the risk of nearby concentrations of nuclear installations is denied to those of us who inhabit the western shores of the Irish sea . #% I recognise and agree with the need for rewards and incentives to industry which will encourage the development of paediatric medicinal products . #% That would inevitably lead to protectionism , which is already raising its ugly head following the French and Dutch referendums . #% I believe that the greatest problem for the European Union -- and perhaps it should reflect upon the two ` no ' votes in France and the Netherlands -- is that we try to make the one suit fit everyone , from one end of the Union to the other . #% Their health and safety is put at risk with fake medicines , foodstuffs , toys coated in toxic lead , flammable children 's clothing and fake alcohol containing high levels of methanol which has led not only to people being hospitalised but also , in one case in Scotland , to the death of a woman . #% As someone who has worked with young drug addicts and young alcoholics in the past , I know that nothing is more calculated to send out the wrong message than proposals calling for the legalisation of illegal substances . #% I welcome the focus on better research in Europe , especially as we know 85 % of research today is without EU coordination . #% It is quite clear that by the discussions here today we are setting up a European military state with its own arms industry , and neutral countries such as Ireland should be well aware of this . #% However , the fact that EU leaders were able to agree a reform of the decision-making procedures within the EU institutions at Nice before Christmas is certainly a step in the right direction . #% 
Developing countries must be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people under their own licensing terms . #% Mr President , I too would like to compliment Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her report . #% On the first thirty pages , I was not able to find a single site for the European Union . #% The Irish pound , as one of the smaller currencies in the Union , has sometimes been subject to external pressures which in turn resulted in very high interest rates . #% Any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution to solve political problems within Pakistan . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their tremendous work in this area and , even if I do not agree with a lot of what they did and their final conclusions , I do appreciate their diligence and their efforts to try and find compromises where it was possible . #% If the deaths of migrants in freight containers , on the undercarriages of trains or in ship holds in recent months demonstrates anything , it is that responses to economic migration based solely on the monitoring of the illegal movement of people will not prevent people from resorting to desperate measures to travel to Europe . #% I am afraid I do not have the information to hand . #% Combined with unemployment and poverty , drugs are laying waste large parts of our cities and destroying the lives of our young people . #% In other words , the current pillage of certain types , certain deep-water stocks by some EU countries would not be allowed to happen . #% The ACP governments , on the other hand , need to show an increased commitment to fighting against tax havens , tax evasion and illicit capital flight . #% We now have the opportunity to revitalise the process and bring a positive message to the peoples of Eastern Europe . #% A properly resourced EU action programme , like Europe Against Cancer and Europe Against AIDS , is needed to raise awareness about the disease and coordinate activities against it . #% The new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport . #% I did miss a vote during the week because of the lifts , but I recognise that in due course these matters will be resolved . #% The emergency regulations prevent him from leaving the country for six months or from being in contact with any foreign person -- even by email or phone -- otherwise he will be rearrested . #% Europe is capable of supplying its farmers with GM-free grain , but if we accept the inevitability , if we accept safety studies that are not really studies at all , then farmers will be forced into feeding their animals GM because otherwise there will be no other grain . #% If we can do that I think we have moved very far . #% I mention this simply to indicate that I am fully aware of the benefits that carefully-developed tourism can bring to a region . #% The criteria for EU funding only of pan-European political parties exclude and therefore discriminate against smaller national parties and independents . #% Also I want to emphasise that in 2004 Irish agricultural exports exceeded EUR 7 billion . #% Now it actually used the money it was getting from these interest payments on land that they were purchasing . #% We have seen many wonderful success stories in the biotech field , the development of genetic insulin for example . #% It must be emphasised very strongly that , insofar as this Research Fund has any impact , it must be on safety at work . #% The Parliament 's draft statute ( rapporteur : Rothley ) , has been approved by resolutions of the European Parliament and President Cox was given a mandate by the Council of Presidents in June to undertake exploratory contacts with the Member State Governments and to report back to the Conference of Presidents in the context of the opinion on the Rothley report . #% As colleagues may know , the peace talks have been suspended since April . #% In external relations , as with previous presidencies , the Middle East will once again be a priority issue . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her willingness to go over time and take extra questions . #% When he was Ireland 's Minister for Finance in 1991 he joined other EU finance ministers in agreeing that duty-free sales should cease by the end of the decade . #% In some cases , this may mean allowing the adoptions to proceed . #% If the criteria the EPP seeks to apply were applied initially to the Irish process , the IRA would still be engaged in its murder campaign . #% My group will not be voting for those particular amendments . #% There seems to be a view that , by asking for the truth to be established , we are in some way taking sides against the Uzbek authorities . #% In spite of the rapid advance of the grey squirrel , our Commission has not carried out comprehensive research to map or to control the spread of this species . #% I do not want to say or do anything which might upset negotiations which are at a delicate stage and where the Council will endeavour to take a common position within two weeks . #% I just want it put on record that I have raised the plight of these people in Guatemala in this House , because I think it is an absolute outrage that people can be treated like that in this day and age . #% What , if anything , did the information offices do to rebut the allegations made in this television programme ? #% I know it is very late and we are testing your patience . #% So , we are not simply talking about listening and caring , but about proper practices . #% Such a composition does nothing to ensure either the objectivity of the watchdog 's decisions or its independence as an authority from Hungary 's government . #% It is extremely important that action is taken to ensure that we reduce the amount of pollution-related diseases . #% Mr President , I come to this debate today with a lot of reservations because of some of the comments made by other speakers in a previous debate . #% I take note of what has been said in the General Affairs Council , namely that the Council will continue with the ratification process . #% I regret though that the resolution on this important subject was misused as a vehicle to attack internal government composition in Member States , which is the product of the democratic process and , frankly , beyond the remit of the European Parliament . #% The idea is to distinguish between how an enterprise relates to internal stakeholders , shareholders and employees . #% Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive . #% Regrettably , the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU 's influence and our foreign policy strategy . #% In my view , it is unfair to blame the workers for constant breakdowns and delays in the train service . #% The present tourism operational programme for my own country , Ireland , accounts for IRL 369 million , which is over 8 % of total Structural Fund spending . #% Since control measures might harm the industry , we also must support the rapporteur 's plea for the issuing of new compensatory training and reconversion measures . #% Secondly , only some countries would take up the match funding opportunities which might arise in return for EU regulation and competence . #% I also find it quite alarming that this treaty basically endorses the whole concept of a European constitution which is something that has not been debated in the national parliaments . #% However , in the final analysis , whether you are new born or elderly , citizen or migrant , rural or urban , nobody should be at risk of violence . #% I am calling on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership to take the necessary steps to re-establish mutual confidence , accept the need to make concessions and focus on the overriding goal of achieving lasting peace and stability in the region . #% This is essential because , by following the road of incineration , any incentive to reduce and look at alternative ways of dealing with the reduction of waste is destroyed . #% I tabled a question on this and it did not come up in today 's session . #% I would urge the House to support the joint resolution . #% I certainly agree with some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , including the need for setting a deadline of seven working days for the supplier to return monies that have been received from the consumer . #% However , we still lag a considerable way behind our European partners in terms of our infrastructure , in particular transport , telecommunications and environmental protection facilities . #% Our consumers expect European agriculture to deliver on these multifunctional aspects , and our farmers are prepared to do this . #% We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade . #% Frankly , we are all sick of hearing that and we do not want to hear it any more . #% But is it right that European taxpayers ' money should be going into something like this when people all over Europe are crying out for essential social needs ? #% In Ireland , we operate a judicial system whereby one is presumed innocent until proven guilty , whereas the opposite system operates in many other EU Member States . #% I would ask you to support the amendments I have tabled . #% The industry would still be subject to monitoring , reporting and verification requirements . #% 
It has been stated by many human rights organisations that human rights abuses by paramilitaries have the support of the armed forces and that the murder of the poor people in rural areas is as a result of this . #% A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness . #% Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations , then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good , healthy and proper debate . #% One of my concerns is not actually about this year or next year but about the new programme which starts in the year 2000 . #% These proposals must be changed substantially before they would be acceptable . #% Can the President-in-Office assure us that , in the new Treaty following the IGC , the rights of children will be given the just , legal weight they deserve ? #% Too much is left up to the Member States . #% This was very effective in the past - in 1992 , for instance , because of the threat of aid cuts the President agreed to a multiparty system - so perhaps we could add the GUE Group amendment as an addendum . #% In particular there is the question of replacing the word `` similar '' with the word `` equivalent '' . #% in writing . - Negotiations for a new global climate agreement are now on a knife edge . #% What I am about to do is to read the wise wisdom of all his words that he has thought out and put on paper . #% The main feature of the Commission proposal is to ensure that Member States set a minimum level of oil stocks for a period of 120 days . #% In the event of the disappearance from the market of a manufacturer , such a guarantee would ensure that the costs do not have to be borne by society or by other manufacturers . #% We are happy to note that , but progress will not be sustained unless there is equality for all its citizens , and particularly the weaker ones . #% This charter spells out responsibilities and entitlements , such as full recognition by the home university of academic achievements , as well as credits to be obtained by students during their term on Erasmus . #% Mr President , I can not speak about the transportation of nuclear waste without speaking about Sellafield , which Mr Chichester has mentioned . #% What mechanism is in place to ensure that an individual or groups of individuals whose data has been misused can get some kind of comeback from the American authorities ? #% We were then told agriculture would be safe in the WTO . #% I would like to seek clarification on aspects of the statement . #% But we all know in this Parliament that any kind of subsidy , whether it is structural funds or state subsidy funds , can not last indefinitely in the near future . #% Those are the comments I wanted to make regarding those two reports . #% So it was clear that the 1984 legislation had to be updated , and I agree with the proposals . #% in writing . - I support this report which urges the Commission to remain vigilant and undertake a review of the scientific basis and adequacy of EMF limits through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks ( SCENIHR ) . #% We should make the creating of a job the most attractive thing that anybody with any sense of entrepreneurship can do . #% The key priorities for the European Union at this time include : the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU , which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States ; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross-border basis ; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions ; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector . #% We need an EU that allows local and regional democracy to flourish and which respects the sovereignty of Member States and their people . #% The principle underpinning this new Community Action Programme is to create an open method of coordination between the Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion . #% Commissioner Byrne , I may add , is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU ' s rapid alert system for food emergencies . #% The European Union is right to support a negotiated settlement in the Middle East which reflects the principles of the transfer of land for peace , which ensures the collective and individual security of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples . #% I would have preferred a stronger resolution but I know how difficult it is to achieve that . #% Each of us is fully aware that junior doctors in training carry out tasks which are virtually the same as those carried out by their so-called `` masters '' , the consultants . #% If we can not even do it in our own Parliament , we should not preach to others . #% The companies we are dealing with here are quite powerful . #% This is frankly not the best way to work , and I am sorry that the Council of Ministers is beginning to expect accelerated procedures as the norm . #% I realise that many small farms do not have the capacity to generate sufficient income for their owners because of scale and enterprise . #% The Charter should be legally binding and enforceable under EU law . #% The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months . #% We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union . #% Mr President , I am aware of the concept of irreversibility of membership of the European Union . #% We know that the European economy has been sluggish recently . #% I welcome the compromise agreement on the Europol convention which , together with the extradition convention , I hope will be implemented as quickly as possible by all Member States . #% Following on from what he has said , Parliament has been told by the Commission that it can not undertake any action because the Council has made a decision and has refused to alter that decision in any way . #% I often give the example - as I did at a committee meeting this morning - of the survival of the only cotton-weed colony in Ireland in the south-east corner of Wexford . #% The comments and the good wishes offered to him are well-merited because , in my experience , no one has done more to ensure a quicker , effective presidency than Ireland 's Minister for European Affairs . #% We really need to change our policy on how we treat asylum-seekers and refugees and we have to stop building the barricades higher and higher to keep them out . #% The promotion of liberalisation and mobility must not be achieved at the expense of public health and consumer protection . #% However , animal welfare must of course also be a priority . #% Madam President , as there is time remaining , allow me to bring to the attention of Commissioner Fischler an issue relating to his decoupling proposals and the area required to be farmed once decoupled . #% There are a number of church-based groups which are under serious threat because of their work in support for justice and peace . #% We need to look at local initiatives , education , training , the organization of working time , promotion of SMEs ; but above all we need to win the arguments for EMU in our regions . #% The honourable Member raises some interesting questions . #% Without clear objectives and a programme of work , this muddled policy will continue to fail the most vulnerable in the region . #% Thank you for what you have done for this Parliament . #% Even with a gradualist approach to enlargement and long transitional periods which will reduce the overall cost , it will still be necessary to increase the size of the budget . #% Certainly I , personally , would support the concept of an EU-wide list . #% What sort of a message do Members want to send from this Parliament ? #% Any proposals will need the approval of Member States . #% The European Union has taken a great stride towards political as well as economic integration today . #% This effort is being sat upon by a gigantic Norwegian effort - which has obviously been subsidized over the years - that will not allow the flagship of fish-farming activities which is salmon farming to get off the ground . #% I am glad to have the opportunity to explain my amendment . #% These rules had been proposed in large measure by the then Irish Minister of Agriculture , Mr Yates , and have been fully implemented in Ireland . #% Undoubtedly there is a high level of expectation on the ground for clearer rules on the granting of aid to TEN-T projects . #% This recast was born because the original directive was being poorly implemented . #% This must change , and I hope that our Member State governments are listening seriously to this debate . #% I want the title to make it clear that it is the G7 proposal for the completion of the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear reactors in Ukraine . #% When we hear talk about utilising jurisprudence in the work that is being done with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and building on that , of course we should all be heartened to hear that our laws and our policies will be guided by those principles . #% 
No joy , no progress , perhaps even no response - I do not know . #% It is therefore necessary to maintain the embargo and indeed to tie it in with making our own Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally binding . #% I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said . #% President-in-Office , it is absolutely disgraceful that up to 700 000 people have been displaced from their homes , their houses and businesses completely destroyed . #% Finally , I attach the utmost importance to the contribution of the European Parliament to the reform of the Cohesion Fund in the coming months . #% There has been a lot of debate -- indeed , dispute -- in this House about how Romania is caring for its most vulnerable children and young adults with handicaps . #% Its ceasefire is fragile , its political prospects uncertain . #% The promotion of democracy , respect for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are all values which form an integral part of the Union which we have built together over the past number of years . #% Human population growth , poverty , bad governance , and the commercialisation of consumption and distribution of poached animals are the underlying causes of the bushmeat problem . #% There is no doubt in my mind that this must be done without calling into question the fundamental principle itself . #% We must encourage enterprise , we must facilitate enterprise but we must also at the same time have a sense of social justice and those two , so to speak , must go hand in hand . #% Within the European Union we have 60 , 000 farmers depending on sheepmeat and milk . #% The initial figure of 70 % Community participation and 30 % national participation in the Haug report , was adopted by a very large majority . #% Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration , asylum , refugees , displaced persons and European visas . #% Pesticides are expensive commodities and farmers only use them where necessary . #% We should make progress on trade conditional on progress in securing and improving human rights . #% The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union . #% We should not forget that the European Union and its institutions were unique in building the foundations for a unique situation and we can continue that evolution of unique institutions for the future development of Europe . #% If there has been a change in attitude I will undertake to communicate the concerns of Parliament to the Swiss authorities . #% It is quite possible also that in an open method of coordination , the national parliaments would also have transmitted to them the proposals which are coming before this Parliament and other institutions . #% The European Disability Forum , in particular strongly argues that we need EU legislation to protect people with disabilities against discrimination . #% Many factors can contribute to relocation decisions . #% One point which I should like to stress from the outset is the gains for small organizations who become partners . #% This is not just to do with the fact of people being denied the right to asylum , but it has to do with how they are treated afterwards . #% But if it is going to happen there have to be a number of measures taken to ensure that the industries that say this technology is safe take responsibility . #% It is amazing that in this day and age people with such huge responsibilities are working under such difficult circumstances . #% While recognizing that the problems are very complex , they can only be solved by courageously taking the first decisions on the various items on the agenda . #% Regrettably Parliament can not insist in law on fiscal neutrality , but it does so as a matter of political conviction . #% The legislative dialogue must be restarted . #% They can not both be right . #% In view of the committee report on Echelon , we should address the issue with some urgency . #% However , we must be committed to an end to human rights abuses in the whole region and should not lessen our criticisms of one country because of our approach to others . #% We in the Committee on Regional Affairs are very concerned at the lack of transparency in the document that you have adopted , the draft communication about the coherence of structural policies and competition . #% The Member States must ensure the budgetary flexibility required in no way endangers continued full funding of PEACE 11 , as envisaged last year when funding for that programme was guaranteed into 2006 . #% The European Parliament now has the power of codecision with governments of Europe in over 50 fields of legislative activity . #% I would agree totally with the previous speaker , that the vast majority of people in the agricultural industry , be they in the manufacturing side , the factory side or indeed at the farm level , are not involved in fraud . #% Mr President , I should like to join in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work . #% A combination of conservation and good management on the one hand , and increasing fish farming on the other , will go some way to securing that future . #% I was in the presence of a cult . #% All stakeholders must be intimately involved in a bottom-up approach if stock recovery is to be achieved . #% The objective of this new directive is to contribute to the improvement of air safety by ensuring that essential safety information is reported and collected , stored , protected and disseminated in order to facilitate its effective analysis and monitoring . #% I would like that put on the record now , rather than tomorrow , because it is of fundamental importance to me , coming as I do from a neutral country . #% Will it more effectively secure the financial interests of the European Community or the European institutions ? #% I am always fascinated by the reality , particularly in an Irish context , that sometimes people complain that Europe is too powerful and yet , when they have a problem and turn to Europe for help , they sometimes complain that Europe is not powerful enough . #% Mr President , very briefly I want to thank the Commissioner and congratulate him on the progress he is making in the particular area of poverty reduction . #% It is time to remember that . #% It is also losing significant state contracts , which enabled it to maintain its public service obligations , because of the public procurement requirements . #% However , we do not have sole responsibility , and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too . #% There must always be confidence in the fiscal framework that underpins the European Union . #% 100,000 people expressed their anger and made it clear they will not accept a European Union based on the lowest common denominator in social , employment , and public service provisions . #% I attended a meeting this afternoon with some Israeli citizens talking about their aspirations for peace . #% For some farmers this could be organic farming . #% It is obvious to us all that the single market is just not working in this sector , especially when you look at the high cost of car insurance in my own country , Ireland . #% It is not an inspiring example of responsibility in action . #% The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States . #% I very much hold the view that there should be no escape for Mr Milosevic and that at some stage he must face the charges of war crimes in a court of law . #% In conclusion , I welcome the statement from Commissioner Fischler on the proposal to decouple aid for tobacco producers , which will hopefully lead to a reduction in the production of this health-damaging crop . #% At a time like this , it is always very difficult to know what balance should be struck between looking for support for a Constitution and looking for fairer debate , but the two ideas are not mutually exclusive . #% Finally , Madam President - if I may be allowed the same latitude as the other group chairmen were allowed - when we speak about energy and common energy policy and energy needs , one of the biggest opportunities that we are denying ourselves is the renewable energy that we can create and grow on our land . #% This Costa report , despite its plausible verbiage , is part of that process of harmonisation aimed at creating a single criminal justice system . #% Maybe you agree with what this or that side is saying , but we would like to know where you stand . #% Let me be clear that we are not talking about micro-management , as a colleague has already said , or individual programmes and projects . #% Madam President , we have all been deeply distressed by the illness of our colleague . #% As the scientific evidence is still inconclusive , we can not allow parents to be misled . #% Unless the proposals are extensively amended many marginalized Irish farms will come under pressure and some may not survive . #% The Resolution calls for the Commission to conduct a full impact assessment of the EU 's policies and programmes in the areas of agriculture , development and trade in order to guarantee a coherent , sustainable policy approach to global food security . #% 
Besides , it is not acceptable for the EU to broaden the definition of Official Development Aid to include other financial flows such as remittances or debt cancellation measures . #% I will deal with the future , because that is important in terms of the review . #% Israel , as a democratic state , needs to ask itself questions . #% I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq . #% On tax deepening , we believe the Commission has opted for an unnecessarily complex formula . #% Mr President , first I should like to congratulate Mr Linkohr , not least for his patience in this apparently never-ending saga of the refinancing of the fourth framework programme . #% As a spokesman on human rights , I would be a hypocrite not to demand clarity as to whether or not detainees have been transferred through EU countries to third countries where they may be at risk of torture . #% I particularly support the Amendment calling for : the phasing-out by 2010 of all forms of export competition , including food aid , export subsidies and state-trading entities , by all industrialised countries in parallel . #% The Lisbon challenge is to delineate policy and methods for redressing these deficiencies and to release this potential dynamic . #% I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria . #% A final matter which gets very little attention is what is done with the vessels . #% We need to have partnership . #% Since we are discussing the budget and our contribution , we have to look into our souls , and I very much hope that the Commissioner will give us an adequate response to the concerns I am expressing about this issue . #% That has a life of its own and needs an adequate fund of its own ; hence my disappointment at the cut in the budget for rural development . #% There is a great danger that the European Union institutions will respond in a piecemeal manner to these appalling issues of violence towards children . #% Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland . #% The second concerns police information which is intended to assist in the gathering of data relating to counterfeiting at both strategic and operational levels . #% If we are going to shut down sugar production in Ireland and in the EU , we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers , even if just to salve our own conscience . #% In conclusion , the rights of each Member State and each person who lives in Europe must be guaranteed . #% access to religious institutions #% Commissioner , I have listened to you answer this question on a number of occasions . #% Farmers and non-farmers must face this reality and do so before it is too late . #% On East Timor - and I note , Mr Prodi , what you said this morning - where are we ? #% For instance , EU cephalopod vessels are allowed to keep over four times as much fish by-catch as Guinean vessels . #% This situation has to be tackled because taxes on the peasants have increased dramatically over recent times because of the need to modernise . #% Strengthening control was one of the key priorities of the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy . #% Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU-US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue . #% I also welcome the Commission 's communication . #% This is the core of the challenges we now face . #% We salute all of those , on both sides and none , who helped to bring us to this day . #% A number of measures have already been implemented under the Wye River Accord , including the transfer of control over specific territories as well as the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners . #% The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions , regardless of how one might feel about the issue . #% We must set common policy objectives together and face the key challenges which lie ahead for the European Union within a united and unified framework . #% Mr President , in complimenting Mr Souchet on his work , I express my disappointment and concern with regard to the Commission proposal to reduce subsidies worth EUR 145 million per year to the food and drink industry . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this report allows Parliament to outline our views before the Commission brings forward its proposals on the future of the CAP by the end of this year . #% I have a report here by Parliament , from the STOA committee . #% I should like to know what has happened to the thinking behind the rational planning in the gas and electricity distribution sectors draft directive . #% I would therefore call on the British Government in this debate to avail itself forthwith of the opportunities available under these regulations . #% My mother died a month ago . #% One of the greatest challenges facing us in the European Union today is to ensure that we do not have a knee-jerk reaction to every horror or outrage . #% We have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the Rapid Reaction Force . #% There is justifiable criticism in the report of the use of violence , inhuman , cruel or degrading treatment or punishment inflicted on persons on remand by the security forces or the forces of law and order . #% Madam President , after that intervention inspired by naked self-interest , may I come back to more important matters of the day . #% I very much welcome the news conveyed to the House by Ms McCarthy of the generosity of the Japanese people in this particular respect . #% This is an issue of violence between people who at some point must have loved each other . #% I do not support this criticism . #% The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags ; they turn a blind eye and do not care . #% These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani . #% Regarding Amendment 2 , while I disagree strongly with Pope Benedict 's quoted stance on the prophylactic use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS , I could not support this amendment because of the gratuitous and inaccurate drafting . #% That is the general thrust of the position we have taken in these areas . #% I hope that in the next Parliament we will address that issue and decide on the appointment of a special Ombudsman for children . #% It is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans aged between 30 and 99 suffer from neurodegenerative diseases , and scientists anticipate that this number could double every 20 years . #% Who , then , could have dreamt that , in the second half of that century , those same peoples would unite ? #% It is as well to remember that in June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive of guarantees for consumer goods and after-sales services . #% The sexual exploitation of children , including child pornography on the Internet , in any form , is abhorrent . #% I think it is ridiculous that somebody who is elected by the body of the Parliament - by the individual Members here within the Parliament - can have their office terminated by a decision of the Conference of Presidents . #% The scale and European-wide nature of this problem have been tragically highlighted by these episodes and it is up to us as a European Community to respond far better than we have done heretofore . #% The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous . #% It is against Amendments Nos 4 , 5 and 8 for legal reasons . #% Let us not forget that every time we use a computer , whether it is to buy Christmas gifts or to book flights , data is already being retained by companies on those websites to target marketing and other products towards us . #% In these circumstances , it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly . #% I ask you , Mr President , to make direct contact with the United States Congress to express the concerns of this Parliament and also to urge the President-in-Office of the Council to make contact with the authorities in the United States to express our concerns . #% In the General Election in a week 's time people in the regions will judge the government on their inability to deal with regional policy issues . #% In that document Mr Bourlanges sets out in paragraphs 7 , 8 and 9 the reasoning behind the conclusion that Parliament does not approve the Council ' s proposals . #% Issues of high politics are caught up in issues of human rights . #% I think it is very timely , and the recent crisis in the dairy sector , which crippled so many of our farmers across the European Union , certainly demonstrated the serious volatility which can affect our agriculture markets . #% 
Mr President , I welcome the resolve that was shown here today by the French Presidency and the Commission in placing emphasis on enlargement as the key priority for the external action of the Union . #% I eagerly await the conclusion of the Commission report of the impact of body scanners . #% I just wish to finish by saying that I understand that the GUE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 5 . #% It has opted for the airport-based approach along the lines of ICAO Resolution A337 . #% Quite frankly , I think the way we are going about our business as we head into the 21st century is a lot better than the way we went about our business heading into the 20th century . #% Temperature increases can trigger serious consequences , with coastal areas flooded and the lives of many people living in island communities under threat . #% However , it is important to note that there has been a reduction in the number of pelagic vessels permitted from 22 to 15 . #% But it had become increasingly obvious , particularly since the Nice European Summit in 2000 , that the old intergovernmental method of revising European Treaties did not enable adequate European responses to the common challenges facing us to emerge , nor did it enable citizens to feel that the process belonged to them . #% You can not continue to shut them out and blame them for non-cooperation . #% The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health . #% In 1995 600 , 000 were exported from the EU and half of those came from Ireland . #% in writing . - Dear colleagues , I rise today in appreciation of the work of our ombudsman , Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros . #% If we are to set unreasonable objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste which take no account of capacity constraints , we might just as well get it over with now , book our slot in advance at the ECJ for non-implementation and spare the Commission a waste of envelopes on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty . #% We must also remember that she is not the only woman in these circumstances . #% The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done . #% The report calls on the Commission to replace this non-strategy with ambitious proposals , including clear targets and binding timetables . #% The one concern I have -- and maybe the Commissioner or the President-in-Office of the Council could respond to this -- is doubt with regard to the legal basis for this directive . #% To conclude , it is a truism that once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage . #% Our group will have to decide tomorrow on this report , on the basis of what amendments are passed by the House . #% As many speakers have said , conventional arms kill more that half a million people a year , that is one person every minute . #% The report examines how universal , accessible and affordable health care systems can be set up and how we can share best practice from the European experience . #% I believe this to be a serious violation of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% In this case I hope it does . #% But , unfortunately , far too much environmental damage still occurs and we must have tough measures to make sure those who cause such damage really do pay the cost . #% The latest figures of serious CFP infringements are -- as we have heard -- those published by the Commission for 2003 . #% Some prevention , and some stopping . #% The issue of decommissioning funds is one that has been rightly raised and is of great concern . #% We are afraid that these monies will be denied to them in the future . #% Madam President , the Commissioner has made three proposals . #% If the proponents of EU citizenship think they will make the EU more loved and more wanted by promoting direct Brussels taxation , then I have to say that , happily , they are more out of touch with the citizens than I ever thought they were . #% We are now at last making good progress under the direction of Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Bonino . #% As long as we have surpluses this system will be necessary . #% I would like to suggest to the Minister that this is potentially an important industry within the European Union . #% Perhaps that explains why our government did so little , took the electorate for granted and was content to mine the Eurosceptic vote for the forthcoming general election , with several ministers in recent months giving very ambivalent signals . #% Any deal on agriculture can not come at any price : it must be balanced and fair . #% It is supposed to be a common fisheries policy , therefore common rules and obligations should apply to all equally . #% Finally , I want to quote the cases of SOLVIT , which I believe is an excellent initiative of the Commission . #% In particular when we speak about the free movement of workers , as was pointed out in the two previous debates on Lisbon and on the Lipietz report , the free movement of workers is not just about internal barriers . #% It was a tragedy but also proved to be a catalyst when finally the political classes woke up to the fact that there was a really serious problem . #% Initial budgetary plans which have been forwarded to the European Parliament for its consideration have included within them a recommendation that monies for road safety campaigns in Europe be reduced by # 1.5 million ( EUR 1.9 million ) . #% We are moving on to a debate on avian influenza and market support measures . #% It can also be complementary to industry in those regions at a time when wild fish stocks are less available , so that the extra capacity we have and the infrastructure for processing and marketing can be made use of through the production of farmed fish . #% All of these problems have to be tackled . #% In essence , we have gained an extra year on the timetable , which essentially means that further steps in protecting our coastal zone will come sooner rather than later . #% I am fortunate to live in one of the most beautiful places in the Union , namely West Cork in Ireland . #% I believe it is important to get away from the emotive aspects of the debate and focus on our role as European legislators , which is to guarantee consumers that we have put a legal framework in place that guarantees the best quality and the safest products . #% Such an approach does not allow enough flexibility to take account of new products placed on the market . #% I completely support a fully effective ETS , as do all my colleagues , but the system is not working well . #% We need time to reflect , to analyse the outcome , to learn from it , to respond to the legitimate fears and concerns and , above all , to try and understand why 65 % of the electorate stayed at home . #% I have another question . #% Here is one example : this is a Manchester United football shirt , coveted by many youngsters . #% Therefore , procedures to improve security standards must be put in place as a matter of urgency . #% This can not be said of many of the other Member States . #% Given that it constitutes a huge proportion of their diet , fluoridated tap water that is not inspected , in which the levels of fluoride are not regularly checked , is a serious health risk to our neonates and infants in Ireland and in parts of the UK where they still fluoridate tap water . #% It is important that the WTO is restored in a reformed way . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Mr President , there has not been any assessment of the social , environmental and economic effects of an economic agreement between the European Union and Canada . #% Reducing the levels of harmful active substances and in particular replacing the most dangerous by safer , non-chemical alternatives and encouraging pesticide-free crop farming are aims I very much welcome . #% It is incumbent on all of us to grasp the opportunities which are before us to help build a more stable European continent at peace with itself . #% It is clear that we will experience a drastic drop in the number of young farmers over the next couple of decades , unless appropriate and effective measures are put in place now . #% I thank Mr Rothley for his research in this area and for clearly identifying the areas in which the legal protection of accident victims can be improved . #% In doing so , we should address a serious failure under FP7 to provide funding for research in maternal and child health . #% As we know , binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration , paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector , who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement . #% Payments are the financial lubricants that allow the real economy to function . #% This whole enterprise can only come about by agreement . #% This issue is now before the courts in Ireland . #% Could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier ? #% 
It is my hope particularly that the Irish Commissioner , Ms Geogheghan Quinn , takes a leading role in the new commission with her innovation and research portfolio . #% I do not want to be difficult in saying that we would vote against it , but , as Mr Posselt has said , we have to be careful about setting precedents . #% We expect and demand no less of our future partners . #% It is also worth pointing out that in the original proposal from the Commission a minimum distance from residential areas was included and was later removed by the Council . #% It is all very well to speak of stringent controls , but you can not guard against human failure . #% There , they have periodical dry-run operations and the strategy nationwide is tested , weaknesses are discovered and the fine-tuning of the whole programme is updated . #% The impact assessment estimate for the UK , if maternity leave is extended to 20 weeks , is almost GBP 2.5 billion per year on average . #% Governments throughout the EU should be honest with their electorate , especially in neutral countries like my own , and say : ` This is really what is going on here . #% It was a decision made in good faith . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I want to correct a misconception about the Irish Constitution which , it has been alleged , bans embryo research in Ireland . #% This will contrast with the past , when Mr Rothley was working on his own and efforts were made just to get a deal done to give a presidency something to their credit at the end of the day . #% This is fine and good , but it must be conditional and selective . #% I would like to commend the Commissioner for her decisive action in putting a proposal to the Venice informal Council to improve the efficiency of structural funds . #% There needs to be a change in the attitude of the current US Administration if the transatlantic relationship is indeed to be restored . #% Mr President , though this House , in self-congratulatory euphoria , will embrace this Constitution , thankfully the ultimate decision rests with the Member States . #% In today 's economic climate there is a growing need for detailed analysis of the effects of recession and other financial shocks on national economies and the EU . #% I encourage the House to establish common sense and preventative action in the area of floods and flood control . #% You only have to look at a photograph of the Heads of States of the European Union and compare the number of men and of women - it is just not acceptable . #% But the fact of the matter is that in addition to the dangers for small publishers , we are facing the onslaught of a massive , blockbuster culture where huge amounts of money are made on sometimes quite appallingly bad books . #% The President-in-Office of the Council , Prime Minister Bertie Ahern , will present to this meeting an assessment as to the state of the negotiations with regard to the new EU treaty . #% This would also give ordinary people throughout the European Union time to lobby for referenda on this issue . #% Mr President , the United Nations evolved from various initiatives to bring the countries of the world together to promote true peace through the recognition of the dignity and worth of the human person and the value of the community -- local , national , and global -- in protecting the person . #% It has been totally counterproductive and every effort will be made in future to prevent similar intrusions . #% The proposal has many good ideas including : outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted ; rules for deciding about fishing , given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort . #% Firstly , we should recognise that Europol did not appear out of thin air . #% We know that a fiscal black hole is opening up in the area of pension provision and we just can not ignore it . #% I appreciate his point that under the 1995 fisheries legislation provisions this is taken into consideration , but does he support the provision of funding commensurate with the area to be surveyed by the Irish authorities ? #% Mr President , it is regrettable that we are having to discuss this White Paper in an inappropriate legal framework . #% That also appears to be the view of the EU justice ministers , who are meeting today to put in place enhanced EU programmes to better coordinate EU asylum policies . #% I fully support the position taken by the Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection , Mr Byrne , when he states that it is dangerous to assume that a Member State can protect its citizens ' health by its own efforts alone . #% I have said that the job losses were very considerable . #% Last week I met with the Abusive Images Unit of Greater Manchester Police , a small , committed team led by Terry Jones , leading the field in expertise in the UK on tracing and convicting child abusers on the net . #% To date , there are three versions of the ` truth ' . #% Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union , together with Europol , must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken . #% Politically , however , I regret the failure of the Vienna Council to adopt specific decisions of substance . #% It would not make sense for us to have a debate without the President of the Commission . #% I just wanted to reply respectfully to our colleague who drew attention to the small attendance . #% Finally , Commissioner , in 1999 I asked you a question in response to which you told me that cars in Britain would be cheaper if Britain joined the euro . #% I want to appeal to you to take Question 9 , which is the next one and in my name . #% I , for one , share that approach . #% I too regret , as previous speakers have , the failure of Member States to insert an energy chapter during the discussions in Amsterdam . #% Therefore , it is blindingly obvious that SMEs will play an important role if we are to resolve the very high unemployment problems that we have generally in the Union and specifically in various regions of the Union . #% Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long . #% From an Irish perspective , I welcome the recent support given by the Commission for Ireland to continue to receive cohesion funds until the year 2003 . #% This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas , but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing . #% What can we do to ensure that they are not excluded from society , and what can we do to help them ? #% The Finnish Presidency will direct preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the decisions taken at the recent Cologne European Council . #% The single greatest challenge facing the European Union is to prepare for the enlargement process with the accession of six new countries to the Union by the year 2004-2005 . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he is aware that recent public opinion polls in Austria indicate that over 80 % of Austrian citizens want to see the sanctions lifted . #% I believe , therefore , with the European Parliament , that the veto should go , and should go quickly . #% However , our tolerant and open society is under threat from organized crime and from the drug trade . #% Mr President , I would just like to thank those Members who voted for my report . #% By saving energy , we produce fewer CO2 emissions and other pollutants . #% These are , in my view , the real weapons of mass destruction in the world today . #% The net result has been that a group of perfectly talented Irish architects were discriminated against and their movement in the internal market curtailed . #% The final issue on which the debate rested was whether a doctor would be responsible for the assessment of the eligibility of donors , whereas the Council wanted a health professional and deemed that to be sufficient . #% Mr President , those who are resisting the notion of increasing the budget in this House should ponder one very stark statistic . #% Over-description would only lead to confusion and is unnecessary . #% Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars . #% It certainly generated widespread headlines almost implying that farmers are criminals . #% I also wanted to say that this is not the last word , and we reserve the right to reopen some of these compromises if necessary with the Council and the Commission to ensure that mediation truly works for our citizens and that we achieve our objectives . #% My hope is that this strategy at European level can help assist and support those most at risk from violence . #% On the one hand , we are warning of the disappearance of oil and promoting alternatives ; on the other hand , sugar -- one of the viable alternatives -- has been made to disappear . #% In many Member States , there is no requirement to even look at demand site management . #% The necessity now , with the advance of technology , in particular the information society , is to upgrade people 's skills , to give new skills to people presently in work , to give extra skills to those who are unemployed and who need to get into new types of work and also to have less regulation on the labour market to allow more flexible access to training . #% What many of us felt at the beginning would be a dossier which would not cause us much of a problem turned out to be an awful lot more tricky than we thought . #% 
They refused to go and were loyal to the king . #% Internally and externally our economic relations are set to reach a new plane . #% The Chinese authorities have successfully persuaded companies such as Yahoo and Google to allow filtering of their search engines . #% The European Union has a terrific responsibility in this regard . #% We can not allow that to happen as a Parliament and we must call for your support right across the political groups for this amendment . #% There are quite a lot of Irish vehicles locked with perishable goods , mostly lamb and beef , in refrigerated trucks which now for twelve to fourteen days have been surviving on a small amount of diesel to keep the refrigerators going . #% I will raise these issues at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly in Jordan this weekend . #% There are a lot of people who believe , Commissioner , that something more positive could be done with this quality meat product . #% It is also extremely worrying that the decision on whether or not a party will share in EU funding will be taken by an institution of the European Union . #% The difficulty is that the financial institutions which are given responsibility for selling these products are in many cases resisting them because they can not make enough money out of the categories of people that they are aimed at , mainly the lower income section of the workforce . #% However , they have been prevented from entering the gallery which is scandalous considering that I made the necessary arrangements . #% That is the way to look at peace , security and justice for all . #% The time has come to make those who engage in the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms legally responsible for damage to human health and the environment . #% The European Union has always been very supportive of my constituency of Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , key to the 1994 directive were targets for Member States for packaging recovery and recycling , to be set initially for a five-year phase and thereafter to be reviewed for subsequent five-year phases - and hence we are here today . #% We must ensure that they are doing what the MAGP intends they do in the long run . #% I want to thank all Members who signed it , even if at times they felt overwhelmed by our enthusiasm and over-zealous attempts at persuasion . #% Every time the European Parliament has debated this issue there have been increasing doubts as to the safety of these toys which derive from PVC . #% To the people of the United States of America , to its President , its Congressional and civic leaders , and its communities throughout the country , especially the peoples of New York and Washington , to the grieving families of the missing and the dead and to those who have survived the ordeal , we express our sympathy in this hour of hardship and devastation . #% The attitude of the US in the post-war situation will provide the key as to whether or not we can achieve any or all of these . #% That is surely solidarity between the generations . #% Last weekend the company placed security men on board its vessels as a bullyboy tactic seeking to force the changeover of staff . #% I would be anxious to ensure that any Eurodac register would be fair , reasonable and compassionate in its application . #% Thirteen million hectares of crops have been destroyed which would be , I imagine , sufficient food to feed 80 to 100 million people . #% I sincerely wish it all success in Dublin and in its concluding days . #% Mr President , Mr Prodi this morning you used a Russian word , glasnost , which means openness . #% I would therefore like to take this opportunity , I am sure on behalf of us all , to salute his sporting memory and to express condolences to his son , his aged father , his brother and his sisters . #% I hope that South Africa will shortly be able to respond to this improved offer and that every effort will now be made to conclude the negotiations as near as possible to the target date of mid-1998 or at latest by the end of the year . #% We in the European Union have set India a bad example and I would also like this House to condemn the transfer of civil nuclear technology to third countries . #% The European institutions and European lawmakers have been given the power by the Member States to make that law . #% Our citizens are very concerned and our policies and funding should match their concerns . #% In Africa , in 2000 , at least one species of red colobus monkey probably became extinct due to hunting , and many other species are expected to follow shortly . #% We must take up that challenge in the context of Agenda 2000 . #% Tomorrow we will vote on a compromise package of 21 amendments . #% We can now afford to do this and these excellent professionals are a boost to our health service . #% The light transit system should be part of an integrated transport system . #% The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture . #% It is unfortunate that during the many months - almost one year - that have passed since the first discussion of the dossier in committee , interinstitutional negotiations have not made any progress . #% Foremost in the minds of Members who , like myself , represent coastal regions of the Union heavily dependent on fishing are the Commission 's recent proposals on the reform of the CFP . #% There are , however , serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999 , when it was agreed that Member States ` determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty ' , but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured then the standards laid down by the EU 's recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% Indeed , consumers in nine Member States , including Ireland , have been penalised by a measure which has reduced their purchasing choices . #% The relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament must not be based on strict contractual terms . #% I believe that this view is now widely accepted and I hope that the Commission now accepts it also . #% I endorse the commitment given at the Copenhagen Summit to start the negotiations with Turkey in 2004 , subject , of course , to a review on progress on human rights and rule of law issues . #% Of course , first and foremost , we have a social obligation and social concern for the most vulnerable within our society . #% The rights of children as European citizens must be fully safeguarded . #% Such central contact points will explain to consumers to whom they may address their complaints and seek appropriate redress . #% Madam President , I believe the document that is before us today is a very significant document . #% There is , however , a need for continued , detailed debate on one issue in particular , a CCCTB . #% Since this is the first time , it is very important that we get it right . #% It would threaten the independent , commercially based and subsidy free nature of British ports . #% This directive must , I believe , ensure that professionals do not face the same uncertainty and obstacles I encountered in exercising the right , as an EU citizen , to exercise one 's profession in the single market . #% The Scottish Parliament estimates that landscape tourism contributes EUR 560 million to Scotland 's economy each year , much of this in economically depressed regions . #% I would like to place on record that at all times this Parliament and its Members were extended every courtesy and assistance at political and official level . #% I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report . #% It was quite clear yesterday in relation to another issue , Guantanamo , when Commissioner Patten said ` We can not do anything without the Council ' . #% Mr President , in isolated coastal communities such as my own constituency , there are very limited possibilities for locally-based economic development initiatives . #% The final package must perforce reflect Parliament 's priorities . #% Rather than reiterate what other colleagues have said , I think the core issue is the junior doctors in training . #% But alcohol causes major problems throughout society , from health problems , to violence , to abuse against other people and the persons themselves . #% This is a good step forward , but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States . #% These proposals were published so late that it is not going to be possible to commit money to projects until February 2004 . #% I will support the conditional motion of censure if the Commission does not satisfy our demands . #% I hope that the US and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases . #% It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today . #% 
We also need clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the consensus and the UN guidelines . #% It should not just be a privilege for us to have Mr Solana present ; perhaps he should be here on a more regular basis . #% However , could I take this opportunity to ensure that , with the good offices of the Commission , and utilising the partnership agreements we have with Nigeria , there will be a greater understanding , not only of the respect for human rights , but also of our total abhorrence of the death penalty in any form , whether it be by electric chair or by stoning or by any other method . #% I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do . #% A target date of April 2003 has also been set for accession treaties to be signed in Athens under the presidency of the Greek Government . #% However , I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commission 's common consolidated corporate tax base . #% There is no need to remind the Commissioner that the beef sector , even before the advent of BSE , was in financial difficulty . #% There needs to be coordination between research infrastructure and regional policy . #% We welcome his efforts in this respect . #% You tell us today how much the European Parliament encourages you and offers your Commission incentive to further your reform programme . #% In the first year , 2005 , the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated by the 21 governments in question . #% My fear is that this will just be a self-fulfilling prophesy . #% I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market . #% Those who say that it is not must not be listened to . #% Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , three are fluorinated gases . #% But over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission . #% Farmers must have guarantees of direct income supports at adequate levels over the medium to long term if they are to be in a position to plan for the future . #% The eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission published today states that IRA members are still heavily involved in fuel smuggling , and that the level of smuggling has remained more or less constant . #% So , by all means , let us have parity of treatment , but let us understand the detriment suffered to date by those who , for years , have kept to the rules on pain of savage punishment . #% However , all of us , and the EU institutions in particular , need to recognise that the plutonium being sent across the seas to Japan from both Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France is directly usable in nuclear explosive devices . #% Regarding the issue of Christianity versus Islam there is a major problem . #% The most moving sight during the Irish presidency was the raising of the flags of our ten new partner countries at Aras an Uachtarain , the home of the Irish President . #% From an Irish perspective , agriculture and the associated food industry are central to our economy , and the chocolate industry , which is the subject of this debate , is a very important component . #% I would like briefly to refer to Mr Mote 's comments : he might be a bit more sanguine about the health and safety regulations if he had once had to gather up the remains of an unfortunate worker who had slipped off a roof and ended up dead on the street below because there was no scaffolding available during his work , and had then to go to the family of that unfortunate man and explain why he was dead . #% Two weeks ago I spent the entire weekend and most of the week trying to negotiate for the handover of children who had been illegally abducted from the United Kingdom and taken to Italy . #% The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake . #% If we were more careful in the way we live and the materials we use , just as Mr Marset Campos said very clearly , we could eliminate this type of problem . #% The failures of those banks have brought on a crisis which continues to severely hurt citizens around the world . #% Whether it be the imposition of one 's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one 's religion , one is as bad as the other . #% While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round , the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement . #% Mr President , I would like to emphasise one recommendation of this report : the need for clarity in GMOs . #% I hope you will pursue rigorously a policy of encouraging renewable energy sources and rational use of energy . #% Mr Novo 's call on the Commission and the Council to guarantee that the Cohesion Fund will continue as of 1999 receives my full and unambiguous support . #% Mr President , during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative . #% It is actually our reckless abandon of the environment that has led to this dangerous changing of our climate . #% The use of the GDP criterion overestimates Ireland 's true position . #% This applies not only to the workplace and job market but also to access to , and supply of , goods and services . #% in writing . - Given the economic crises the EU is facing , it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties . #% The strong transnational dimension of the problem requires the establishment of high standards of Community law in relation to child sexual exploitation , standards that also apply to the CEEC countries where the problems are even greater than within the Union . #% It would have benefited from the structural funds , amongst other things . #% No one had conceived of using a fully loaded , large passenger plane as a weapon . #% We must now proceed in a planned way with their integration . #% In Austria , foreign ski instructors can not provide services for more than 14 days . #% Under what rule or regulation did you write the letter ? #% The vigilance we are rightly demonstrating on the release of genetically modified organisms on the environment and food safety must be intensified with regard to research in the sensitive and ethical area of gene technology and its impact and implications for mankind . #% Is the Council aware of this study ? #% Having said that , it can not be ruled out that any horse could enter the food chain at the end of its useful life and therefore safeguards are necessary to cover this aspect , as I have already mentioned . #% The clear Council statement of December 8 needs to be driven forward with vigour and determination by you . #% Why are we having this ? #% We might benefit in the heavily populated urban areas , the normally profitable areas , but at a very great cost to the non-urban areas . #% I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports . #% This is very important , because I believe that issues of taxation should be addressed by national parliaments and not decided centrally by the European Union . #% We share common democratic values and interests and we stand together willing to fight against terrorism and promote those interests and values . #% Let us take it one step at a time , let us at least have observer status at the coordination meetings and at the meetings where the real work is done and of course be part of any press conference and press briefing that may wind up the week . #% This is also a feature of the Irish rules and on the larger ships it is quite usual for a veterinarian to travel on board to supervise the stock . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , President of the Commission , colleagues , this is an important place in which to celebrate this important moment . #% On the one hand we are saying to governments that they must reduce their deficits and taxation , on the other they must increase spending in order to match European money . #% The second criteria is that the regional approach should be followed . #% As for weapons of mass destruction , I agree that somebody like Saddam Hussein should not have control of them , but there are others in the region who should not either . #% I would also like to ask a supplementary question . #% When I came to Europe in 1989 , we did not have a food problem . #% At the moment , unprocessed wool is being exported out of the Union . #% In this regard the role of farmers and processors is crucial . #% Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency . #% The decision is based on scientific evidence and will bring some movement in the beef sector which is very welcome at this time . #% On the last occasion they insisted on dismantling agricultural support and then proceeded to provide support for United States farmers at a level three times greater than that received by European farmers . #% 
This is a new world with a new economy where fair distribution of wealth and tackling climate change are new priorities . #% Population-ageing , increases in the incidence of disease and increases in the treatments for them mean a greater demand for workers in the health sector . #% A working group has been set up in Europe to bring forward conclusive proposals on the basis of draft regulations which have been drawn up , so that a level playing field can be reached on this issue . #% When I saw this letter to Mr Howard , I have to say I was absolutely horrified and so were other Members of the European Parliament to whom I showed it . #% Macro-economic policy such as structural adjustment programmes should be brought into line with the requirements of guaranteeing long-term food security for all . #% If this House does not give assent to the general regulation , there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it . #% Mr President , I should like to apologise to the House for being absent when my name was called earlier , and to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak . #% In that context I would like to make some very brief points . #% It is making an impact with the citizens . #% We are prepared to engage in the debate on closer cooperation and welcome the way it has been put to us by a number of important political personalities outside this House . #% Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty , poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market . #% What issues has the Commission identified in this important debate and how does it intend to promote discussion on them in the future ? #% We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place . #% The emphasis in this report on decentralization is very welcome wholly from a European perspective . #% The European Union needs to be extremely diligent to ensure the same fate does not befall the people who go out and vote . #% This identifies the weaknesses in the policies where we have a quota system and at the same time require vast Community resources to subsidise surpluses . #% The guilty people continue to walk the streets of their community and to associate with their political family despite the pretence of disowning them by the Sinn Féin leadership . #% I see no reason why European Union Member States can not work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible . #% There is a deception I have to say being perpetrated on both the regions of Europe and the EU by some national governments , not least the government of my country , the United Kingdom . #% In Ireland we consider VRT to be a national tax and we consider the mix of taxation , the rate of taxation , to be a matter falling within national competence . #% The UN Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs prohibits the use , manufacture and distribution of ecstasy , LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld . #% The European fight against trafficking is a major crime issue but it is also a fundamental matter of women 's rights . #% It says that there can not be respect for human rights as long as there is armed conflict . #% Animal feed or , more appropriately , the ingredients used in its manufacture are understandably central to the regulations governing food safety and consumer protection . #% This must be avoided if the European sector is to meet the challenge of quality and competitiveness in the future . #% It is not , as Mr Mote said , that the Irish were kept in ignorance : they were treated differently . #% Ever-closer union has failed . #% However , Turkey too has serious obligations . #% The Union as a political entity has a moral and legal obligation to ensure that a clean environment is protected and promoted under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty . #% Until such time as both sides can be brought together to work out a solution then peace will never arrive . #% However , it is vital that the same standards apply to imported foodstuffs , otherwise the antibiotics only just banned in the EU could make their way back onto our plates . #% I hope the Commission is as concerned about this as Members of Parliament are . #% I hope that at the end of the temporary conference all Member States will ratify the setting up of the International Criminal Court so that the war criminals who are so prevalent today throughout the world can be prosecuted . #% These distinctions are important and , in particular , we must ensure the continued free service for those who most need it . #% Only USD 3 billion a year is being spent globally in trying to halt the spread of AIDS . #% We could say that Ireland is a country under construction . #% We have this tradition of regulation by professional bodies , not with the kind of legal base that is common in other states of the Union . #% Again , as we await the ratification of Amsterdam , the same logic applies to institutional reform . #% There is just one point I would like to make , and that is the greater need for transparency in our financial institutions , be it at regional , national or EU level . #% In the end , there was an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament , the Commission and the Council which said that we , through our Committee on Development for example , would have scrutiny rights over the DCI , and we set up groups to carry out that agreement . #% That starts , in my view , with good , clear drafting of laws , high-quality impact assessments and effective , comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation . #% Dublin II is fast approaching , to be preceded as we have heard by an Ecofin Council next Monday in Brussels . #% There are new laws in place . #% The effects of the dramatic drop in the price of milk in 2009 were compounded by the EU 's inability to react swiftly enough to the situation . #% In relation to Amendment No 5 I fully support it . #% This is only right and proper in the light of the fact that consumers are criss-crossing the frontiers of the European Union on a daily basis . #% I will support the truth that the fundamental rights of the human person are from God . #% We have not been able to fill our quota this year because of the BSE crisis . #% There is always a dilemma between humanitarian aid and the political dimension . #% The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process . #% Medicated feed or feed containing pre-mixed antibiotic additives have one very definitive purpose on large units : to treat sick animals . #% Madam President , it has been an interesting debate . #% It is not the same form of terrorism we have experienced in France , Ireland , Spain and elsewhere , by ETA and other terrorist organisations . #% Of course we have to defend our democratic way of life when it is threatened by violence , but we have to do so in a way that does not deny or reduce basic human rights , not only for society in general , but for those sections of society which are alienated from society at large . #% It was a new technology which fired many hopes , some of which have been realized , most not . #% We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees , and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes . #% I did such a course in the Irish language a few months ago and was refused such allowances even though in years past such courses have been sanctioned by Parliament . #% Continuing the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports on a voluntary basis in the future does not go far enough . #% I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States . #% Ingredients in cosmetic products are now to be listed in full , including the ingredients of perfumes information which so far has not been available . #% Instead , he delivers clear and factual information quickly to the people . #% The debate has centred on statements of personal preference proposing/opposing the argument , using the Netherlands and Finland as case examples . #% The misleading business practices in question typically consist in luring businesses , as well as professionals and non-profit entities , into being listed in a business directory free of charge only for the signatories to later discover that they have signed a contract with a fee . #% Under the economic governance package , Member States will have to be more transparent with their own budgets . #% Each of us must have concern for those who suffer the horrors of addiction and we must do all that is possible to assist them to recover from their addiction : facilitating the use of drugs is not the way to assist them . #% The form of terrorism that now threatens the world has no boundaries , no identifiable location . #% 
To run through this as if all hell will fall on us unless we finish by 12 noon does not do justice to the statement that has been made by President Santer . #% It will be very difficult , if not impossible , to create a single currency without the support of the citizens of the participating countries . #% The European Union and the United States have a strategic role to play in the recovery process . #% Mr President , there has been a lot of criticism here this morning about the fact that contracts have been awarded to Korean companies and the damage that this has done to the European industries . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I hope this debate and resolution will add , in some small way , to the international pressure to successfully achieve the release of Alan Johnston following his abduction two weeks ago . #% As indicated in my reply , I can not speak for the Council on this matter . #% We must ensure that we can help our colleagues in the Danish Government withstand the pressure they are being put under by voices in the media to go back on their present position . #% The difficulties being experienced by the existing Member States in relation to reaching agreement on a single currency are nothing compared to the broad range of issues facing future enlargement to the east of which the future of the common agricultural policy and the structural fund review are but two . #% I would like to see a more concerted effort by the Commission directorates to work closely at all levels , not only between Commissioners but also between policy directorates , to take up the challenges of EMU , enlargement and the future reform of the structural funds . #% But structures have evolved to pressure them and monitor their activities ; to ensure that they were disarming and completely committed to politics . #% Secondly , it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas , in particular . #% For example , Ireland and Britain have common law systems in operation , but many other European Union states have a civil law structure . #% We must protect our public service broadcasting . #% We must never forget that terrorism is rooted in poverty and social exclusion and , as we discuss the economic governance of the EU at the spring summit , we must realise that our economic growth depends on peace and stability which , in turn , depend on our efforts to ensure economic stability and growth in those parts of the world where poverty and social exclusion are the norm for millions of young men and women . #% In the longer term , in the light of experience and information as a result of implementing the framework Water Directive , we may then be in a much better position to translate threshold values at national level into EU-wide groundwater quality standards . #% What is more inexcusable is that we have tolerated this . #% Education and training needs to be improved and the number of women in higher level education needs to be increased in order to afford them the opportunity to become more involved in politics . #% It is important for women who have not been in the workforce before to get access to it . #% To my mind , those are the two key issues with regard to achieving the Lisbon Strategy for the future . #% I suggest that we now need to make immediate use of the existing network and to ensure , at the same time , that there is improved support for it . #% With Blair having agreed to surrender the British rebate by stages and as the real cost of enlargement builds , the situation will only get worse . #% Legislators must not be afraid to state harsh realities when looking at potential impacts . #% I should only like to say two things , which I already mentioned to the Prime Minister but perhaps President Barroso could take them on board as well . #% Mr President , I am probably going to be the only person here tonight with my position on this particular report . #% There is nothing in the health and safety regulations that is an undue burden on business . #% The half-a-degree temperature rise is similar to that observed at the end to the twentieth century . #% Therefore , it is important to break new ground , to offer fishermen the hope of greater participation than they had in the past . #% However , that said , I believe that the committee 's work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date , and certain facts are available . #% This is one of the few rights that individual Members have : to question the Commission and the Council directly in this House . #% Although the end-result of the Treaty negotiations represented a step forward , they did not go far enough . #% Mr President , we understand the reasons why Commissioners Lamy and Fischler can not be with us this afternoon . #% However , I believe that the Parliament needs to review our entire working methods and staffing with a view to improving our effectiveness and efficiency . #% The involvement of the United Nations in the conflict would be a welcome step forward . #% I know that , as a skilled lawyer , you are committed to ensuring legal certainty for both business and consumers . #% The group considers Amendments Nos 3 , 6 and 10 as very important . #% In conclusion , I would like to see the reprocessing of nuclear products terminated at Sellafield . #% This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another . #% I have to say that it can not bring in closures and tie-ups to help recovery without compensation , as this will not work . #% Mr President , a single currency should result in lower interest rates in many parts of the European Union . #% It is a bad mistake and gives a wrong signal . #% Peripheral and island regions have their own specific and geographic characteristics which require European Union responses , particularly with regard to infrastructure and employment needs . #% The bottom line in relation to every aspect of the application of GMO technology , particularly in food production , is transparency , consumer information and accurate labelling . #% Mr President , would you get into a plane flown by a pilot who was exhausted and had worked more than 70 hours in a week ? #% The question is , how do we do that ? #% With regard to the EU operational programme for forestry and the generous funding available for afforestation , it is imperative that the end product of this investment is a quality , sustainable forest product , one capable of yielding over time a return both for the individual farmer and the community . #% Critical new clauses , which we have insisted on and which were met with resistance in the Council , are the provisions combating asset stripping . #% We would view any change in this objective as a reason for voting against the report . #% As I said , this is an own goal and we will end up importing products from the US via the Internet . #% I know that the Commissioner will be most innovative in bringing forward new ideas for e-Learning and for education . #% He was a fearless journalist who over many years tirelessly illuminated that twilight world where gangsters and political terrorism and political extremism intersect . #% However , this is a crime without borders , and as such , it is European legislation as much as national laws that will truly put an end to slavery in Europe . #% The sad truth is that Mr Slobodan Milosevic is the only leader in Europe today with a clear vision for Kosovo and the political will and military means to see it through . #% Has this legislation achieved its objective or , on the contrary , has it led to distortion and fragmentation of the internal market ? #% Accident victims with very severe injuries such as paraplegia would not receive sufficient cover with a maximum sum of EUR 1 million . #% The situation is not altered by Ireland 's participation in the European Rapid Reaction Force , but it is still very important and politically necessary for a declaration to be made in Seville expressing the support of EU governments for this special foreign policy issue , which means so much to so many people in Ireland . #% That being said , however , we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights . #% This is not a humanitarian effort , especially when you see what happened last night , when civilians were killed as a result of NATO activity . #% A train leaves Brussels at 7.20 a.m. , and we are considering the possibility of arranging transport from Luxembourg , where the train arrives at 10.00 a.m. #% The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish , not to mention damage to non-targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as coral beds . #% The common position as drafted presents a major problem for my Member State , Ireland , regarding Article 67 on prescription-only medicines for veterinary purposes . #% With regard to the services directive and the financial perspectives , Parliament is willing to act as a political body to ensure that it can deliver on behalf of the European citizens , in cooperation with the other institutions . #% When I returned from Parliament I found my neighbours - I shall declare an interest , I live in that part of the city - were bobbing around in boats , carrying their pets . #% I would call on this Parliament and on your good offices , Mr President , to forward that immediately as a matter of urgency . #% This is not only a slur against myself - and it was put to me in these offensive terms - but a slur against the work and function of the Bureau and , moreover , a slur against officials of Parliament who can not come here to answer for themselves . #% However , according to many reports which I have read on this issue , RDAs are set far too low and should be revised upwards . #% I wonder whether you could confirm that flights are leaving from Strasbourg airport , or if there is any problem ? #% 
Bearing in mind the measures and plans aimed at better regulation at European level , it is to be hoped that the procedure used for debating data retention will not become the rule ' , to quote directly from the report to Parliament . #% Is there a policy to deal with such chaos in the mind of the Commission ? #% For this reason the Labour MEPs have voted against this #% Many voluntary groups concerned about the material which is undoubtedly appearing and , as Carole Tongue has rightly said , is very easily accessible need to go back to some of the most simple rules when , whether you can understand it or not , you try to accompany your children on some of their journeys into cyberspace . #% We have a duty to respond to their plight . #% Can I also ask his view in relation to this being an issue best applied by Member States ? #% I know Members are making comments for reasons other than that they expect me to respond . #% I would like to echo the Commission 's comment that this report follows the Mercury Strategy which was passed in March of last year , and want to encourage the Commission in its ongoing work on the Mercury Strategy . #% We want to see all industrialised countries take urgent action to reduce or limit future greenhouse gas emissions . #% Madam President , the EPP Group welcomes this initiative particularly because it is the first initiative on discard tabled by the European Union . #% We have in our midst enough innovation , ingenuity and compromise to bring forward positive , new initiatives to ensure that all the peoples within Europe can benefit from what we are trying to create here today . #% I am pleased to see that businesses recognise that consumer confidence is critical to the growth of this small-business e-commerce network . #% Madam President , in September we have the hearings and , as I said , I do not wish to anticipate how they should proceed , but my group 's strong preference is that in September - subject always to the reservations that we must see what emerges - we should take a decision and rid ourselves of a sense of crisis . #% Thirdly , the by-catch allowed to be kept by the EU fleet is far higher than what the Guinean fleet is allowed to keep . #% However , recent scientific analysis has shown that , in spite of the satisfactory utilisation rates in this segment , coastal demersal resources have plummeted and have forced the small-scale and industrial fleet to fish in neighbouring countries . #% Little did I think 30 years down the road that nothing would have changed , and I hope the same happens to duty-free . #% To date , Ireland has done nothing to meet its international obligations , but continues to provide complicit sanctuary for these international terrorists , making a mockery of their affirmations in this House , when President of the Council , that they were committed to the fight against international terrorism . #% What representation did the Commissioner receive from the United Kingdom Government about this dire emergency ? #% This does not just concern major oil companies , it also concerns other European multinationals which ignore their responsibilities for human rights , for the environment and for basic civil liberties . #% I am not convinced that our current rules meet my concerns and I do not believe that computerised systems alone will protect us . #% The Council of Ministers acknowledged , inter alia , that the economic , ecological and social relevance of the forest sector in the EU and the contribution that forest and forestry can provide to the Lisbon objectives of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness , as well as to the Göteborg objectives of safeguarding the quantity and quality of the national resource base . #% It is a very balanced report . #% Would the Commissioner just comment on that as an area where the new Commission should certainly take an interest , since , if consumers are to have accurate information , we need to tighten up on labelling . #% The slow and ineffective handling of the Dell application risks a return of much of the allocation to Brussels , and this lesson was disregarded . #% Where will the next nuclear disaster be ? #% Surely you are aware that we expressed serious criticism of the Election Commission and its lack of independence ? #% Can the President-in-Office give the House an update on research in these areas and how soon we can expect a positive breakthrough in the area of alternative fuels ? #% We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution . #% I know that it is very late at night and everyone is very tired but I did ask a specific question of the Commissioner and I think the Commissioner misunderstood me . #% But I have spoken with organisations in the UK and Ireland this morning who are clearly as frustrated as we are . #% This is a very technical subject and indeed to comprehend it one needs an understanding of almost all the details of the entire common agricultural policy . #% The Convention has carried out a great deal of work since it was first established 18 months ago , and we now await the results . #% The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products . #% The US State Department has consistently reported that Colombia 's armed forces have taken measures to punish human rights abuses in their ranks . #% New trans-European networks , as has already been stated in this House , provide an opportunity for greater mobility and easier access to the market for people with their goods and services . #% . Thank you , Commissioner , for your response . #% The fact that between 1995 and 2002 farm incomes in the European Union rose by an average of 7 % highlights the very large disparities between countries , between crops and between producers . #% There is a situation I remember in Yes Minister , a British television programme which many us have often enjoyed , in which Sir Humphrey announces that although they have the hospital they can not afford to have any patients . #% That is the thin edge of the wedge . #% I am sure that Ayatollah Khamenei will reverse the decision -- as it should be -- in favour of those who are trying to bring peace and reform to Iran . #% However , it is happening and it should be celebrated . #% Eventually this practice will catch up with us . #% Such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable . #% The international press treated the conference with a certain amount of cynicism ; some called it a fiasco . #% I think it was the spokesman for the PPE who raised a point that came very close to me when he talked about the rights of the victim weighed against those of the perpetrator . #% Surely this is a prime example of where we can achieve best practice among ourselves by all Member States ratifying the relevant conventions and promote best practice externally or globally by , as the Commission itself suggests , setting an example by ratifying the up-to-date conventions . #% It appears that one country has offered medical supplies , while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support , including aircraft . #% I am very aware of the concerns of the horse industry , particularly the thoroughbred industry , and I do not have to remind the Commissioner that if a full and up-to-date range of therapies is not available , there is a real risk that foreign investment in stud and training establishments throughout Europe will be lost to third countries . #% The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of , and access to , new modern telecommunication facilities . #% The work of Father Shay Cullen is typical of the work carried out by Irish missionaries not only in the Philippines but throughout the world . #% It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation . #% The European Union is a union of states and peoples and the success of the Union as an economic and political entity is premised on the fact that both smaller and larger Member States are treated in many respects as equal partners within the Union . #% It is absolutely imperative that neither the chief electoral observer nor any of the team pursues a political agenda in relation to the country they are observing . #% Fortunately we can draw on our experience of a change of currency in 1972 , when we broke with sterling . #% Obviously the Greens would have liked to have seen this directive strengthened , but we know that the tactics of the tobacco lobbying industry were to try to get an amendment put in so that when it went back to the Council the majority there would change it , because of undue pressure by Germany , in particular . #% I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved . #% It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing . #% Mr President , I would like in the first instance to commend the rapporteur for his work . #% I know of your own personal commitment but actually you have not given me any clear indication of what the Commission is actually going to do in the UN conference which is taking place in a couple of weeks time . #% Unfortunately , the rapporteur had to take the brunt of most of the negotiations , but she certainly had to work very hard to ensure this report got through within the necessary timeframe , which was very important as we were under pressure to secure the extension of her derogation which was due to run out in June of this year . #% There is tremendous enthusiasm for all types of renewable energy . #% I personally believe that mutual recognition already works . #% It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002 . #% This strategy contributes to the ` Clean air for Europe ' programme , for which I was Parliament 's rapporteur . #% There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see , but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission . #% In the Scandinavian countries support for the single currency is rising . #% 
Parliament can not be expected to make important decisions on such matters unless the necessary and appropriate information has been forwarded to the Members for their consideration . #% in writing . - I voted for this proposal in recognition of the many volunteers who do invaluable work without the recognition they deserve . #% I welcome the conclusions of this week 's Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers ; they too stated that the will of the Irish people must be respected . #% I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue . #% However , considerable anxiety has been created in Ireland by irresponsible scaremongering on this issue by people fundamentally opposed to European integration , people like my colleague in this Parliament , Mrs McKenna of the Green Group , and the ethnic nationalists of the Sinn Fein Party in Ireland . #% It is not the first time I have heard Commissioners come into this House and say they have no obligations in relation to nuclear power plants and that this is a matter for the Member States . #% New TENs projects are needed to address existing and future bottlenecks , along with a sufficient infrastructure charging policy . #% I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE , she courageously initiated moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative . #% We owe it to industry , to small and medium-sized enterprises and individual inventors to provide a simple , affordable Community patent which in turn will help EU innovation and competitiveness . #% The wide-ranging recommendations contained in the report should be implemented , and soon . #% I would refer her to the comments of her colleague , the Austrian Foreign Minister , earlier on today in Parliament , when he said that job creation would be the top priority of the presidency and that under the Amsterdam Treaty the EU now had the necessary instruments available via national employment plans in specific and binding areas . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr van Velzen for focusing on the White Paper on an energy policy for the European Union in his report . #% We talk about forced labour and child labour in various parts of Asia and we condemn them , quite rightly so . #% You want the EU to be guided by five major principles : openness , liberalisation , competition , transparency and interconnection . #% The enlargement negotiations are broken up into 38 different chapters . #% It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this . #% Here again we hope that , in working through the programme for January , where these overlaps arise they will be explicitly identified and addressed in order that potential conflicts in spheres of responsibility should not slow down the reform process . #% If we in Parliament can not show enough maturity to deal with the real issues of the European Summit and the European Council , rather than going back to basic party political bickering between different individuals , then it is a sad reflection on this House . #% We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September , a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore . #% One of the difficulties we face in our discussions is the justifiable desire to ensure that the press and media in Europe have freedom of expression , the freedom to poke fun , the freedom to satirise , the freedom , in some cases , to insult people . #% Similarly , dispersal of 1200g of powdered plutonium would deliver lethal doses of radiation by inhalation with a radius of more than 2 km . #% However , this is where we differ from some of the speakers and from the proposal in Mr Mann 's report , in particular Paragraphs 11 and 13 , which deal with taxation . #% I thank the Commissioner for his usual , very comprehensive reply . #% The rational choice is to stop the profligate use of petrol and diesel and to change the behaviour of the public and of those involved in transport . #% We must not repeat this mistake . #% If it is only a matter of time before countries are dragged before the ECJ for non-compliance or non-transposition of a particular regulation , this brings into disrepute legislation passed through this House . #% I need answers for the people of Watergrass Hill , Glenville and other towns : the people who are struggling with life in shiny new clusters of houses with no soul . #% A food can not be called organic if it is genetically modified . #% We all have a right to be proud to be in a position today to formally approve the Accession Treaties for ten countries seeking to join the European Union . #% Sensitive and sensible implementation must be encouraged to ensure political and public cooperation and understanding of what we have to achieve . #% Do not panic : the right people are on the job and hopefully we will have no more problems . #% I join Mrs Flesch in complaining about the quality of translation . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I wish to draw your attention to an article in the Spanish newspaper El País , dated 30 March and headed ` Eavesdropping on half a dozen countries at Council headquarters . #% I hope that this House will give broad support to the proposals from the Committee on Development which have been carried out in quiet disquisition but based on our experience of the negotiations we went into - and I remind the House that we merged 14 regulations into one in the DCI . #% Recently , I met with the head of the customs authorities in Ireland in Dublin Castle , and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20 % of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland , a small country - actually comes via China , and that when they actually seized them and analysed them , they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement . #% I would like , on this my last occasion , to make a plea on behalf of the Commissioners from small countries : small may be beautiful , but small can also be highly competent , colourful and efficient . #% I was the rapporteur on the Development and Cooperation Instrument . #% One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers . #% But I suppose we should not be surprised : Mr Sharon 's own terrorist behaviour in Lebanon , when he permitted the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps , was subsequently condemned by Israel 's Kahane Commission of Inquiry . #% It is high time we stopped paying lip service to working mothers , their children and their families in our European Community . #% Madam President , access to environmental information is a fundamental right and I am glad that the rapporteur has sought to restrict the use of confidentiality . #% However , ' inexplicable ' is becoming more and more the norm in this House . #% I want in particular to pay tribute to Commissioner Bonino who , over the weekend , made statements which were so incisive and so transparent that the people of Europe - I am sure of it - saw for the first time a commissioner coming out and saying exactly what needed to be done ; saying exactly what the people of Europe wanted to hear . #% It matters because of the potential in our own European Union and in the whole of central and eastern Europe . #% For many years Mr Tom Hyland , an Irishman who has made this the cause of his life , has led international demands for action on East Timor . #% What is more , it says nothing about disabled people in China . #% Could I say also in regard to the hearings process which will be in two parts , i.e. written and oral , that we in the Liberal Group will want to know from each of the candidate Commissioners : ` What is the perspective that you will bring to Europe for Europe ? ' #% NGOs , government bodies , international organisations and local authorities must work together to deliver multisector emergency assistance to those in need . #% It must be said at the start that both the Republic of Congo and Cameroon have highly repressive governments . #% We hope that Member States will not ignore or dismiss this House 's wish for action . #% Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what I am really saying to you Commissioner , and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again : There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen . #% I would urge those who have information to come forward and give that information to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and put it on record , and finally bring an end to this . #% This would give us and the least-developed countries a distinct advantage over the US , which would find it hard to separate GM crops and natural equivalents . #% author . - Madam President , first of all , I welcome the fact that this issue is being discussed here today . #% However , what about Euratom inspectors ? #% The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report . #% I have two very brief supplementaries in regard to that . #% That is why , more than anything else today , we need to put this regulation in place . #% In this way consumers can continue to have a high level of protection without hampering the functioning and development of wireless technologies . #% I am aware that criminal law is essentially a Member State competence and we must avoid taking a position that would seek to infringe Member States ' rights in this area . #% He has done it . #% In fact , those countries that have embraced the enlarged EU market have grown from strength to strength . #% President-in-Office , in dealing with a sovereign government , is it not important , unlike the initial questioner , to always keep a sense of balance ? #% My duty as a MEP , is to stress the necessity of climate change protection to : the people we represent , our EU counterparts and our international partners . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , the committee and the political groups requested that we vote on compromise amendment 4 first , as it is the amendment that was agreed with the Council and the Commission in the trialogue . #% As the previous speaker pointed out the ideal is approximately 0.7 % . #% 
The EU continues to do much to combat the rise of Aids and to provide information on preventive health programmes and support for access to anti-viral treatment for all . #% On that subject , the matter of paedophile priests and their victims , which affects the whole of the European Union , is one of very serious consequence to us all . #% Not only is it a nonsense , it is a scandalous nonsense . #% If there was binding legislation that major European companies had to adhere to , then you would not have the situation we have at present . #% I welcome your commitment to take action in the social services and health area . #% Only last week the Irish Government announced a dual strategy involving the spending of # Irl 430 million on improving rail safety standards , alongside the expansion of commuter train services in Ireland . #% If we are not willing to give respect to ourselves within this Chamber , if we are not willing to work within the rules and the laws as set down by our own Rules of Procedure , invoking our rights and powers under the various treaties and under the new constitution -- if it is adopted -- then no one outside this House will have respect for us . #% The European policy which seeks to assist us with the development of our afforestation is not all that popular in Ireland and yet I believe it is wise in the long run . #% Progress will only be made if it is agreed that it is a truly international city to which all traditions have a valid claim . #% Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Commission text proposes that the penalties for abusing a child under the age of 10 years should be more severe . #% I thank him for his commitment and belief in both these directives . #% We want the implementation of commitments in the White Paper on renewable energies , for example . #% They see how the Commission is working in this whole process , and what they see is that it is those on the minimum wage , those who are in collective agreements , are being hit with these austerity plans . #% The media was likewise obliged to give as much coverage to the `` no '' campaign as to the `` yes '' campaign , without challenging the irrelevancies , despite the fact that all the major political parties , farm organisations , trade unions , press editorials and even the Conference of Bishops urged a `` yes '' vote . #% This is an abuse of that Convention . #% I am particularly sympathetic to the situation in the Azores , where the dairy sector is very important and has had serious difficulties . #% At least people come here to the Parliament and they are heard and listened to . #% In addition to my work in the committee I have also participated , on behalf of Parliament , in a great many international conferences . #% National laws and policies should be improved through the development of comprehensive national action plans to prevent , protect and prosecute . #% I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because , at present , we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts , and they are the people - the financial institutions and others - who have most to gain . #% This new protocol with Mauritania is now the Union 's most important protocol with a third country . #% No changes at present can be agreed at EU level concerning tax policies without the unanimous support of all EU Member States . #% We must fully implement the Action for Growth initiative , which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks . #% The time has come for the implementation of a positive renewable energy programme , rather than continuing debates , both within governments of Member States and here in this Parliament . #% They are particularly concerned . #% I do not want to repeat many of the things colleagues have said here this afternoon , but we have to recognise that at the heart of the tragedy is another generation of little people living in those squalid camps in Palestine who are growing up , and the first game they play is throwing stones at soldiers -- just as they did in Northern Ireland . #% As with the Irish language , there has been a great interest in it and more people are speaking Scotch-Irish today than have spoken it for many years . #% Even if some countries in the developed world are not pulling their weight on this score , I believe that the EU and other like-minded countries should , nevertheless , work for more ambitious action in this area . #% The second point I want to make is in relation to the financial contribution report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna . #% We have all seen the vigour with which Member States have pursued the surveillance of fishing activities so far , and I would like to know the Commission 's view on this question . #% I can think of many good reasons for the EU to embrace the culture of life , the dignity of the human person and God . #% I believe the appointment of an EU Aids ambassador would enhance the international effort to combat the spread of this tragic disease . #% - I respect the reasons for which the British delegation has abstained on Amendments Nos 5 and 8 - junior doctors - but I have not followed this line since firstly , this is a negotiating position and secondly , my close family experience of a highly stressed and overworked NHS midwife do not allow me to impose long working hours on vital medical staff for any longer than is absolutely necessary . #% We should not throw staff , money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist . #% The pretence that it is the developing countries who will benefit is totally erroneous . #% As we all know , that is highly unlikely . #% For serious package waste management to be successful such symbols must be easily identifiable by the consumer . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , on the balance of this report and support the general call for more labelling and information for the consumer . #% Jeggle and Souchet often cause me little problems but Mr Cunha 's report is different . #% Mr President , as the European Union 's Chief Election Observer during the 2000 and 2001 elections , I witnessed at first hand the terrible consequences of violence in Sri Lanka . #% The OSCE parliamentary assembly has also addressed the question of developments in human rights and sent a delegation to Turkey . #% It has an upside and a downside , the witness protection scheme . #% He wants to be the creator . #% Each of us has a right , and indeed a responsibility , to ensure that we can maintain the best possible balance for all within the fundamental principles of consumer rights and protection as well as remuneration for the artists . #% I have some concerns about an overbureaucratic system coming into place because , at the very least , there would be more documentation required of Member States . #% As a long-time passionate lover of chocolate for more years than I care to remember , I am sure the Commissioner will agree that , if for sixty years people have been eating a product called `` chocolate '' , they are entitled to continue to eat the product called `` chocolate '' . #% Mr President , my compliments to Mr Andria for this report on the Commission communication to Parliament and the Council dealing with policy issues and the future challenges of clearing and settlement in the European Union , the process through which transfer of ownership takes place in a securities market . #% I am reminded of the saying ` give a man a fish and you feed him for a day , but teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% The fact that BSE and its impact both on farmers and consumers continues to dominate our political agenda is an indication of the seriousness of the current crisis . #% The imprisoning of Gaza 's population behind walls and barbed wire fences must end immediately if a political and security disaster for the Palestinian people is to be averted . #% It is positive that the regulation avoids a one-size-fits-all approach . #% The directive can be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy , where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design can be promoted . #% In the European Union we devote something like 0.3 % of our resources to development cooperation as a whole . #% That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now . #% I am sure that the benefits of cooperation will encourage further cooperation and democratization . #% Technically speaking , there is no difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning . #% How can we stand by and watch starvation in many African countries , while the leaders are laden with the trappings of exceptional wealth ? #% I hope that as the Commission itself contemplates the sensitivities in agriculture relating to the World Trade Organisation and to the agricultural reform debate , the sequencing of those debates will not be allowed to get in the way of the trade-related initiative . #% Each member on their boards and principal committees is a volunteer -- there are 15 000 of them in my own country -- as are the majority of their staff , except in the larger credit unions which have up to 2000 paid employees . #% We must also be firm in our commitment to honour the Kyoto Treaty and to go beyond the rhetoric of environmental protection . #% These genetically modified varieties will make decisive contributions to feeding the world 's rapidly growing population . #% We in Parliament will say ` yes ' to new taxes but ` no ' to more taxes . #% That means an increase in the justice and home affairs budget . #% In conclusion , I would welcome any improvements that could be made to the implementation rates for structural-funded programmes and projects . #% Only by collective resolve can we defeat the evil of terrorism , and I welcome the recent measures taken by European governments in this regard . #% Furthermore , I feel it is important to underline that protein is a necessary component of animal diets and the current feed ban is placing us in a precarious position regarding protein supply for animal diets . #% 
The EU has a responsibility . #% However Parliament 's report also shows the cost to the exchequer as it is estimated that the cost to society of gender-based violence - in the form of spending on healthcare , the legal system and social services - is EUR 2 million per hour in total in all EU Member States . #% I believe that aquaculture can provide part of the solution to restoring the balance between imports and fish produced within the EU . #% We have therefore voted to that effect . #% Finally , I would urge the Irish authorities to address , without further delay , the deficiency we have with regard to recycling facilities and also the fact that in Ireland agricultural waste is not considered waste , and so we have the spectacle of beautiful lakes - like the lakes of Killarney - being full of phosphates and so on and fish being killed because agricultural effluent is going into these lakes . #% This must be seen as a new and worrying development . #% I am afraid there has been no progress on practical transposition in our Member States . #% I wish him all the best in his new role . #% Both Shell and BP are investing massively in renewable energy technologies . #% The budgetary implementation of the reference year was almost 100 % for both commitments and appropriations which is a unique and commendable result . #% Custom and practice pending any Supreme Court decision in Denmark would suggest that the status quo should prevail . #% Mr President , rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler . #% There should be more structural assistance for technological development instead of heavy infrastructures in the less-favoured regions , especially in the Objective 1 regions . #% As such , our vision must be narrowed : the sustainability of food and the needs of those who do not have automatic access to food must be put first ; farming practices and innovations should be geared towards more food , and the correct crops ; and , as we draft the new CAP bill , we should finally ensure that the new CAP will work towards a carbon-free Europe , and one which does not exacerbate the current carbon problem . #% I appreciate that the Dutch , for example , have a particular problem about disposing of carcasses so vaccination is for them perhaps an option to ring-fence the disease . #% Madam President , may I send my best wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for a speedy recovery and thank her for her long-term interest in this important issue . #% Also , bearing mind that our own Irish Minister , David Andrews , has launched a campaign for a nuclear-weaponsfree world , backed by one other Member State of the European Union , it is also important that other Member States of the European Union back David Andrews on this initiative to get rid of nuclear weapons totally . #% I heard this afternoon that the captors have said that they will make no further effort to make contact after 7.30 p.m. our time . #% The budget for 1996 was fully implemented and no case of fraud was reported . #% Can I take the opportunity to say that it is good that we are having this debate here tonight and getting some things out in the open . #% They sent us this memorandum asking our support for action to solve their problem and to have justice . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - Madam President , I welcome the two Commission communications on the biomass action plan and on the EU strategy for biofuels . #% I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter , namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties . #% I await with interest to see how the British Department of the Environment intends to comply with its legal obligations under this important convention . #% We must not underestimate the magnitude of this task . #% Services of general economic interest are essential for improving the quality of life for all citizens , and these services are often central in helping to attract investment to less-favoured areas and rural areas , thus boosting their competitiveness and leading to greater cohesion within the EU . #% Madam President , the principle of this legislation is supported by the Liberal Group as a proportionate , timely and appropriate response to the ill-judged extra-territorial legislation of the United States . #% I agree with the deal , I think it is a good deal in general and better than the previous deal , but there are still requirements for further clarity on it . #% We need a Treaty which will ensure that the European Union institutions can take decisions in a simplified and effective manner for many years to come . #% The change of legal basis from one relying on QMV -- Article 95 -- to one providing for unanimous voting by the Council -- Articles 93 and 94 of the Treaty -- is very much in line with precedent and , fortunately , with my own government 's position on tax legislation . #% Mr President , waste is a major problem throughout the European Union . #% Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply mentioned the Kyoto Protocol . #% The report which we are dealing with today relates to the setting-up of a new Erasmus World initiative which is due to come into operation in the year 2004 . #% In Ireland , we have our own problems with media ownership that we must regulate . #% I have tabled amendments in my report to underline my opposition to the patenting of software as such . #% You say there will be no further funding . #% Mr President , this is a framework directive with ambitious targets for the protection and improvement of water quality , taking account of the polluter-pays principle . #% In this particular instance the UK Treasury was directly responsible for regulating Equitable Life and it would have been faced with claims for billions of pounds sterling had it found that Equitable Life should close down . #% However , we are not discussing a normal country or a normal part of the world . #% We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours , but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace - a just and lasting peace - is going to be easy . #% Rather , money from Axis I should be ring-fenced and targeted to the agricultural community , which is directly involved in farming . #% One other point : where I come from , in recent years there has been a continuing downward trend . #% The Irish Government has so far refused to do this . #% We should regard this as an urgent priority . #% And even at the final debriefing of heads of mission in Islamabad , little or no opposition to our analysis was expressed . #% However , this increase in visitor numbers is masking an underlying trend , a striking regional imbalance . #% Would you ask the President to invite the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider a change to the Rules so we can check it electronically ? #% In January , an Irish Christian Brother , Father Larry Timmons , was killed by the police , having attempted to speak out against the corruption and irregularities associated with the distribution of ID cards for the forthcoming election . #% By now we should have found some alternative to it . #% The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted . #% I am not satisfied with what happened , but I also thank you for your letter , Mr President . #% Another report says we are only half self-sufficient so it a pity that students or even planners looking at documents like this see such contradictions within a few pages . #% The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time . #% Hun Sen has already decided who can and can not be taken before a tribunal , thus challenging the powers of any court . #% Mr President , it is clear that vaccination works and it is clear that we have a responsibility to the people who are suffering from the absence of vaccinations . #% Let me ask you two questions : do you not get frustrated that , when you give such a clear and unequivocal answer , Members do not accept your word ? #% in writing . - I welcome the decision of the European Parliament to approve aid for the Dell workers under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund . #% The sums allocated in the Commissioner 's proposal for science and society were inadequate . #% As we face a difficult debate on the future financing of the Union and Agenda 2000 , we must not lapse into an arid , sectional and narrow debate on budgetary policy , to the exclusion of the wider vision . #% Fishermen have promoted the following as alternatives in Northern Ireland : further targeted decommissioning ; real-time closures ; additional technical conservation measures . #% I believe it is difficult to say that there is no danger or threat there , without some sort of monitoring and assessment of the situation . #% I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters . #% Sadly , this progress has not for the most part been shared by people who experience mental illness . #% Why should they be in a career which has economic uncertainty when other occupations offer a much more attractive life , much more security , work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , with week-ends off and with long holidays ? #% I agree with President Santer 's claim that the European Veterinary Office based in County Meath in Ireland can play a vital role in restoring consumers ' confidence in food safety procedures . #% Intimidation and the capacity to impose its will through fear has always been as vital a weapon to the IRA as its guns and its bombs . #% 
There is a need to allow for flexibility within those models , to guarantee that the core values of putting the human being at the very centre of what the social model is about remain paramount . #% Indeed , I have evidence that construction activities are taking place . #% However , without prejudice to the overall support of the European Police Office , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its effects on police cooperation , the rapporteur , and his fellow rapporteurs in the LIBE Committee , feel that there should be no amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision until such measures can be adopted under the new legal framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon . #% So what are we going to do here ? #% It was the first such meeting since the European Parliament ratified the new College of European Commissioners and the new President , Romano Prodi , has stated many times that he is deeply committed to involving Parliament in more decision-making in the future . #% It is essential that in an ever-changing world , in technological and financial terms , we upgrade people 's skills . #% Sri Lanka depends for its economic recovery on foreign direct investment and on EU economic support . #% Mr President , the four reports being discussed today concern fisheries in widely different areas of the globe : the Antarctic , the Baltic Sea , eastern Canada and here in Europe . #% However , we should not imagine that this was an ideal world in which to live . #% Some EU countries are breaching the Stability and Growth Pact rules and are doing so with impunity . #% These proposals provide for basic norms in three key areas : the authority responsible for determining the receivability of the asylum applications , the independent institution to which the asylum seekers can resort to re-examine their application and the appeal procedure . #% I , along with other Members in the House , have full confidence in the Commission ensuring that there is an innovative and new way of guaranteeing security for this domain in the future . #% Therefore , the context of concentration and consistency , referring to Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) areas , is somewhat restrictive and let me say why that is so . #% The simple aim of the proposal is to ensure that wherever consumers shop in the European Union , they will enjoy minium levels of guarantees and will be able to seek redress in their home countries . #% The incidents that have taken place in Jos , a city that has a history of violence , are very alarming . #% Of course we must give the tools to our security services to ensure that they are able not only to prevent terrorism , but also to capture the perpetrators of terrorism , those who finance terrorism and those who are involved in other forms of criminality , whether it be drug-trafficking , money-laundering or people-trafficking . #% It is important , however , that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas . #% In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important `` Amsterdam leftovers '' . #% There was a lot of debate in this House about whether artwork sold by auction would go to America rather than to Europe if we adopted this legislation . #% From an Irish perspective , we make the working assumption that the elimination of hazardous substances includes the prohibition on discharging radioactive substances as well . #% Farmers who want to fill out the 100 % of their base-year area are going to have to take that land . #% If BNFL had such a blue chip record in the field of public health and public safety why do lobsters along some parts of the east coast have levels of contamination 247 times greater than was the case only in 1993 ? #% So , if this provision is removed from the technical measures regulation , as the Commission is proposing , then Member States will not be able to impose stricter measures outside their own waters . #% You advised us to contact the sub-editor of the Irish newspaper concerned . #% The Community Fifth Environmental Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution . #% I note in terms of the future that the legislative proposal for regional policy from 2007 explicitly embraces an urban dimension and , within the competitiveness and employment objective for which my region will qualify , there is a commitment to concentrate on areas which have the most serious problems . #% Smaller regional airports might have a hard time paying for new expensive measures , while airlines can not be asked to increase their ticket prices . #% Without this reorientation the Ombudsman 's role , however worthy , can only be overwhelmed by our democratic deficit . #% There can not be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries . #% We have been inviting him for over six months and apparently he is far too busy to join us , but he would be very welcome . #% The other issue - Kaliningrad - is also directly linked to enlargement . #% The report states that an act of malice - and this was presented to us before September - could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high-level waste tanks , in Sellafield in particular , with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl . #% If we take the example of the Community 's approach to food safety legislation , whereby legislation is based on the principle that consumers have the right to know what they are consuming , then the same principle must apply to tobacco products : smokers should have the right to know exactly what they are smoking and what the effects are . #% in writing . - I supported this report which presents the Parliament 's view on the expenditure required for policy implementation and administration for the financial year 2012 . #% The brutality with which she has been treated in the English prisons is outrageous and I ask you to intervene with the British Government so that something can be done . #% While the Russian authorities condemn Chechen resistance fighters on the one hand , on the other hand they support ` resistance fighters ' in parts of Georgia . #% In particular , the guidelines need to be simplified and reduced . #% I should like to refer to the question referring to ` misuse of the budget to fund abortion ' . #% With regard to the sheepmeat sector , the Commission should , as an emergency measure , suspend the stabiliser at least on a temporary basis to enable the system to reflect the reality of the market-place for Irish sheep farmers who are leaving sheep farming at an alarming rate . #% That was not done in isolation : President Barroso already had confidence placed in him by the governments of the 25 Member States who put his name forward for that position . #% We have to ensure that lawyers , who are an essential part of any effective and credible system of justice , are allowed to conduct their professional duties without any hindrances or fear of intimidation or worse . #% In this context , I would highlight and support Amendment 12 which recognises the need for a generous phasing-out period for those regions which may no longer qualify for Objective 1 support but which may still need this level of funding . #% Also at the outset I want to congratulate Mr Rocard on his tenacity and persistence in getting this report through despite , at times , virulent opposition from certain groups , with myself most virulent and opposed . #% Parliament 's duty should first and foremost be to the citizens , not to industry or the military . #% This case is a test of the movement 's sincerity , of its repeated disavowal of criminal activity in all its forms -- or are they just more weasel words ? #% Madam President , the agreement reached at Nice will now pave the way for the enlargement of the Union . #% They believe that the Oslo negotiations and the various Camp David discussions would have conferred legitimacy on such a step . #% On the VAT question , I agree in substance with what the rapporteur has said . #% The enforced reduction in mobile roaming charges is good for consumers across Europe . #% It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market . #% As regards travel expenses , ever since I came here it has been an issue that has been raised by many people , especially people in my own group . #% They will exert pressure on politicians to allow them to go fishing to try and make some money . #% Has the Commission received from any Member States ' customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement ? #% I do not see the citizens of Europe out on the streets demanding the right to vote for European political parties , but I do find them demonstrably rejecting an ever-increasingly centralised Europe such as in France and Holland last year . #% Where I come from in Northern Ireland the rural community is falling apart . #% We do not need any more over-emphasis on this particular position . #% I would also ask colleagues to consider this particular situation and support our amendment , which is number 89 . #% The main focus of this resolution is to nudge the international community forward , to ensure that Burma is put on the UN Security Council agenda as soon as possible . #% It is not enough to introduce it in one Member State alone . #% I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on her first session here in Parliament and thank her for her honesty . #% We now need a sustained debate on Nice . #% I have one small , further request to the Commissioner . #% author . - Like myself , the Commissioner is totally au fait with the Irish situation , where 18 000 workers cross the border every day from one jurisdiction to another and where 5 200 students and 1.7 million people either take holidays or go shopping from one side of the border to the other . #% However , there is a growing dissatisfaction among air travellers with regard to the quality of service which they are receiving from many airlines within the EU . #% The weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed to protect the free world . #% Article 175 has inbuilt safeguards ( in Article 176 EC ) against unilateral trade distorting decisions that may be protectionist in nature rather than environmentally justifiable . #% 
The decisions on how to reduce the fleet should consider not just the status of the stocks the fleet fishes but also other impacts of the fleet . #% What I would say to the honourable Member is that both sides must work to respect minorities on the island so that we can respect each other 's traditions and bring about a lasting peace in which we do not threaten each other . #% We are asking Member States to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy - and they all say , individually , that they have this commitment - by signing a Charter on renewable energy - the EURENEW Charter . #% Mr President , the introduction of the EU beef labelling is a further step on the road to traceability and in the present climate a prerequisite for consumer protection and public health . #% We must all reflect on the difficulties of the last twelve months in particular and learn from the mistakes that were clearly made . #% By their very nature , secret services can not be controlled and therefore we , as Members of this Parliament , who claim to be concerned about human rights and basic civil liberties , should be questioning their very existence . #% Mr President , the question at issue here is the political management of globalisation , so that we can encourage the orderly development of trade and avoid market disruption . #% Only the National Liberation Forces rejected this deal and this group has been linked to the death of the Irish Archbishop , Michael Courtney , who was the Vatican 's envoy to Burundi . #% I also welcome the proposed improvement and accessibility of signs aboard ship and the provision of alarm systems which are not only accessible to all passengers but which can be seen and heard by all passengers . #% So , we should stand in solidarity with the right of all people in Lithuania , in Russia , throughout the European Union , and elsewhere , to live in peace and in accordance with their own identities . #% I believe that imaginative gestures must be the order of the day if the roadmap is to have any chance of survival . #% Punitive and deterrent justice through the criminal courts is much the best option . #% It allows us all to bring our best experience to addressing the issues which we all want to address , being the Millennium Development Goals and the needs of very poor people in a suffering part of the world . #% We currently do some of those things , which makes the current programme even more topical and even more useful . #% You may say that it is not possible , but I think you could at least give a rough estimate . #% If we in the European Union are to be taken seriously in promoting high standards of human rights in the world , we must make sure that our own house is in order . #% Indeed , paradoxically , the Danish instrument of ratification of Nice will be lodged in Rome today ; the French , as we have heard , have also ratified the Treaty . #% Communications , education , access to modern methods , application of sound medical advice and bridging gaps in the issue of public health at Member State level are vital . #% And I would just ask the Commission to bear in mind that if it really believes that labour costs are the main potential factor for driving up inflation it will be making bad policy decisions . #% Thirdly and finally , in preparing for 2003 as the International Year of the Disabled , will it also give extra support to the Special Olympics , which will take place within the European Union in 2003 ? #% Of course , everybody likes to say we must help the young farmers . #% I woke up one morning to find that Irish soldiers were being sent to the Rapid Reaction Force . #% It is appropriate that data banks be set up at national level concerning persons found guilty of paedophile activities and everything possible must be done to make it easier for children to provide evidence to the court without fear . #% It is a terribly important area but in the new ACP-EU partnership agreement there is a special reference to the tackling of corruption . #% The Internet is a vital part of our interconnected information society . #% Ever since the European Convention was set up , however , extensive negotiations and discussions have taken place across all elements of European Union society . #% It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement . #% In many respects they have been made the scapegoats in the present controversy and are certainly paying a high price for a crisis that was not of their direct making . #% It requires you to bring the other actors together to ensure we have a success . #% The Council needs to get its act together . #% It is disgraceful that there is no mechanism in place today to verify compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention . #% Increased production should only be contemplated in those sectors where a ready market can be found for the produce , and in this regard agriculture must prepare itself to meet the challenges of the world marketplace . #% We must engage Congress as Mr Barón Crespo said , but I have to tell this House in my experience Congress is thinking of the November 5 elections and is not all that much engaged or wanting to engage in discussions with the European Parliament . #% Nobody in this House wants to vote for a situation that will in any way harm the future thriving of SMEs . #% On 30 December last year , I received a petition on behalf of concerned citizens signed by over a quarter of a million people calling for us to bring in that ban . #% I appreciate the spirit of the question and I am sure it is one we all share . #% Arising from our visit and in particular our visit to the refugee camps in eastern Nepal , the delegation gave a commitment that they would do everything possible to raise the issue of the continuing plight of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal . #% Mr President , I would merely like to ask the House to support Mr Hume 's resolution . #% I voted against this report as the EU should be seeking ways to improve our competitiveness in line with the Europe 2020 strategy instead of introducing legislation which threatens our competitiveness . #% The Commission and the EU as a whole have to deal with this . #% On the Kurdish issue , a guerrilla war using terrorism continues in the south-east -- a Kurdish area of Turkey -- and must be condemned . #% Mr President , this evening we will identify what are probably the two make-or-break issues for the next WTO round in Cancun - TRIPS and public health and agriculture . #% What is right for Sweden is not the choice of others . #% Decision making in this way is not to by-pass democracy , it is to extend democracy . #% Of course it has to be reformed , but at the same time we have to ensure that the services which general interest deliver are delivered in an equitable , fair and a universal way . #% The response of the Commission is not what Parliament demanded ; we asked you to submit proposals to the European Parliament but your response has been to expand your previous committee . #% Up to 30 trade unionists have been assassinated in Colombia this year alone . #% Children under three years of age can not read and even children up to the age of six are not really capable of reading and even if they are , are they really competent to make decisions on this ? #% Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanctuaries left in Europe . #% There was also no time for a technology assessment or for a study on the impact on the internal market . #% It is clear that a large proportion of the measures needed to improve air safety should be geared towards preventing accidents , rather than providing a response when accidents have happened . #% So my question is : will this agenda for new jobs and growth not apply to Ireland or Greece or , indeed , any country that is implementing these severe austerity measures ? #% I regret that the Convention avoided this issue , and particularly regret that the delegate from the Verts/ALE Group , Johannes Voggenhuber , neglected to make progress on it , being drawn instead by a grand design for a new constitution . #% More families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict . #% It is imperative that the European Union guarantees that the benefits of new information technologies are incorporated across all sectors of European industry . #% There is little doubt that fisheries agreements are coming under much closer scrutiny to determine what they achieve and what they deliver , not only for people in the European Union , but also for the countries with which they were concluded in the first place . #% Madam President , we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves . #% As has been said by another speaker , it is not correct to have a clause like this regarding the Court of Justice and a decision that must be taken there . #% I also believe that , as Commissioner Patten mentioned , this involves basically the whole issue of a European arms industry . #% In order to meet the global demand for food , it is essential to maintain our current production levels . #% Secondly , we must question whether the meat being imported into the European Union is being fraudulently misrepresented on importation . #% The formulation of a long-term objective of food security must be strategically based , with specific targeting of aid . #% Along with most colleagues , I welcome the fact that a series of reforms under the current and past Commissioners have brought agricultural expenditure under control . #% The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue . #% It calls on the Commission to provide the European Parliament with a quarterly list of cases listing Member States taken to the Court of Justice in the field of waste management . #% Illegal human trafficking in the EU is now worth over EUR 4 billion annually . #% 
The international community , under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union , must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people . #% While every individual State in this Union insists on going its own way and designing its own policies for foreign aid , we will not have the political influence , or the material effect on the wellbeing of the people to whom we extend aid . #% Furthermore , in its statement the Presidency expresses ` concern ' about reports of manipulation - very mild indeed - and you ask the Election Commission to follow up such complaints . #% We have an obligation as legislators to create a legal framework that bolsters the confidence of our consumers in the food they buy and eat . #% Finally , one of the great disappointments of Laeken was the failure to reach agreement on the siting of up to 12 new important EU agencies . #% We should have the courage to use our experience and our position in the world to promote peace and stability in the global arena and to treat the problems of displacement and terrorism at source , for example by helping to ensure an economic future for the millions of young people living in the Middle East . #% Before any rate is decided on , the first step should be to evaluate the Community 's rural development needs , cost them and then set the appropriate rate to meet the cost . #% The Commission 's decision to reform the sugar industry and to cut the supports it paid to growers never favoured the Irish sugar industry . #% Finally , I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing . #% In these circumstances I think an investigation by the RUC would lack credibility . #% We can call them unionists or nationalists . #% Since my appointment as Mediator for Abducted Children , I have learned a great deal and much of what I have learned has sickened me . #% Such bureaucracy is unacceptable and must be cut back in these times of economic crisis , not enhanced . #% I welcome the flexibility provided for in the derogations . #% We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted , doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs . #% As the Committee on Legal Affairs has commented , the proposal should be considered as a point of departure rather than of arrival . #% The proposal is important because improving the conditions and criteria under which passengers should be reimbursed and assisted in the event of being denied boarding , cancellation or long delays is something that must be welcomed . #% It is time to react ! #% In fact , that is what is responsible for bringing it into Northern Ireland . #% The EU must therefore look at ways of encouraging banks to lend whilst ensuring that the mechanisms put in place by the EU to support SMEs are accessible . #% I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on feeding fishmeal to young calves that have high protein requirements . #% I believe that ` education , education , education ' is the real answer to poverty . #% I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages . #% There is a role for economic policy coordination , but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States . #% From an Irish perspective , I strongly believe that Member State governments must have a veto over tax changes at EU level . #% The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States , to ease the bureaucratic burden on them to establish compliance with the tax codes of the states in which they are operating . #% If we did not have this agreement this migratory species would not be conserved for the benefit of the local fishermen and would probably be exploited in any case . #% Civil protection structures have to prioritise preparedness for floods and droughts . #% In addition their failure to support a stronger role for local and regional governments in the management of European funding is a blow to democracy and partnership . #% We feel more concern about cheap supplies to processors than about the income of the fishermen whose interests we are supposed to support . #% That is in no small measure a result of your role in the Chair . #% They did say earlier that they could not do that . #% A European company without participation in some form is unthinkable . #% By way of explanation , consider the following quotes : #% Madam President , in the tension between totally free market access and the preservation of indigenous national employment , I unapologetically see the priority as protecting local jobs . #% I would like to ask him what monitoring system has the Commission in mind to ensure that there is a balance and an equal share-out of the funding across the regions ? #% We should recall that it was the European Union that took the initiative recently to ban the use of particular chemicals in the manufacture of plastic tiles . #% However , EU governments are going to have to hammer out an agreement as to how the rules governing economic and monetary union are going to operate into the future . #% As a Europe of Values we are committed to ensuring ethics , accountability and transparency as integral parts of all our dealings . #% You gave it , the Commission followed ; this House followed . #% Madam President , dear Nicole , my Group supported you at the outset . #% We are doing this on the understanding that the Council will work closely with us to produce a common and unified human rights report for the EU . #% The EU needs to monitor what is happening carefully and be careful which sides it supports . #% Belligerence between Spanish and Irish fishermen and the destruction of fishing gear inside the Irish Box have recently been reported . #% We must police and enforce this fully . #% So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead . #% Regulated commercial trade in these species is allowed , however , such trade must not be detrimental to the survival of the species concerned . #% So it is not a socially just policy . #% I am happy about the inclusion of my amendment on the necessity to ensure consultation , cooperation and , where appropriate , compensation for farmers when their activities are restricted owing to the enhancement of landscapes and habitats . #% I very much welcome the participation of representatives from the parliaments of the applicant countries in the Convention and look forward to the fresh insight they will bring to its workings . #% It is ironic , that the people in this House who argued against Nice , because Nice was too much Europe , are now saying that Europe should instruct its Member States not to ratify Nice . #% The SDLP - the party led by John Hume who is in this Parliament - has given its support for the first time in the history of Northern Ireland to the police service there and they should be congratulated for that . #% The first is the issue of those who invested in Lloyd 's and whether or not the British Government is obliged to compensate them for their losses . #% After all the stocks need our help . #% They cooperated with the Commission in the technical measures and were prepared to look very sincerely at them . #% So we should not have a debate based on misunderstanding . #% Mr President , I am not naive enough to think that this incident is unique , and recognise that it is common practice for intelligence agencies worldwide to gather information for their governments . #% We need to get to grips with our different world views . #% How do UK car manufacturers export record numbers of cars to the continent at a time when exporting is more expensive ? #% It is unacceptable that European multinational companies are investing in and backing up a system where large-scale gross violations of human rights are taking place . #% The question is in relation to flags of convenience . #% On a personal basis I would like to wish him some short period of relaxation in one of the many beautiful Greek islands which some of us had a opportunity of visiting in recent times , during the presidency . #% Could it be , Mr Barroso , that he is the right man in the wrong job ? #% I believe that the Environment Committee has in this instance made a valuable contribution to the original Commission proposal . #% Currently , the laws exist in most countries but are simply not being enforced . #% It was difficult to find somebody who could encapsulate all the desires and wishes of all the Member States , someone who will also have the necessary degree of independence to give proper political leadership to the Commission in the future . #% 
There has also been the question of giving certainty with regard to some form of uniformity : not a harmonisation but a uniformity of sanctions and penalties as they apply across the Member States . #% The Stability and Growth Pact States provide the 15 Member States of the Union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies . #% When we condemn this particular action we should remember that there are Loyalist and Republican thugs who are deliberately attempting to undermine an agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland , both north and south , and we will not let them do that . #% I urge this House to stress to the Commission and the Council that , while we may be counting beans in terms of budgets , they are dealing with people and families and their actions are having a very severe impact on them . #% I will be voting against that and I will explain why in a moment . #% His statement gives credence to our fears about the creation of a European arms industry . #% Mr President , listening to the debate this morning you would imagine that , not only is there a European crisis , but that Europe does not have any answers or responses to the will and the wishes of the people . #% America Online , for example , runs its own merchant business programme where it guarantees to support the consumer in getting legal redress from any of the businesses that use them as a provider . #% We must implement initiatives which guarantee that older people in our society can lead fulfilling lives with confidence and with a full sense of reassurance that their needs are fully protected . #% Decisions concerning key national entries will remain the exclusive domain of individual Member State governments , and any changes concerning taxation policies or social security matters will be left to individual countries to decide on . #% It is important to substantiate this and it is important to note that for a number of years the economic growth in my country has been between 10 and 12 % - in sharp contrast with the late 1980s when it was 0 % . #% I will not use the original Gaelic : ` Who shall speak for the lonely and the oppressed ? #% There is some indication that is changing , but Mr Chichester is right to say that unless there is openness and transparency , there will most certainly not be any sort of public confidence . #% That is not the answer for those countries . #% Might it not be better to consult Parliament along the way , rather than come back and tell us what you have decided , Commissioner ? #% First of all , tourism is an indigenous industry -- it does not rely on inward investment -- and it is not a mobile industry in the sense that there is no off-shoring or outsourcing of jobs . #% There was a quite absurd concentration of time limits , particularly since some of the time was lost because of extraneous events . #% So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions . #% Mr President , relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe . #% We have all seen how volatile currency markets can be . #% It then took the Irish Government six months to apply for the EGF , and seven more to answer to the Commission 's request for clarifications . #% At a time when the industry is on its knees with farmers facing bankruptcy and workers in the industry losing their jobs , it is disgraceful that the Council of Ministers is unable to reach an agreement on a compensation package . #% We have had the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problems . #% In conclusion , I welcome the statements made by the Commission and Mr Cushnahan , but regretfully the statement made by the Council does this House an injustice because it is an insult to our intelligence and for what we stand . #% This has been a particularly bad year for the Middle East . #% I would like to make a special plea to ensure that Member States ' veterinary services are properly resourced . #% In conclusion , I would make a general comment about the contribution of the EU to improving environmental awareness and protection . #% They want aid and are very grateful for it . #% Already we have lost IRL 200 million in tourism receipts since the outbreak of FMD in the UK some weeks ago . #% Drugs come in by land , sea and air . #% We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel . #% The announcement of over 2 000 jobs leaving the region from Dell , together with thousands of ancillary jobs , represented a loss of historic proportions . #% It is also disturbing to read in the explanatory statement - and this has been raised by Mr Kindermann - that 100 000 tonnes of herring was caught as a by-catch with sprat in the Baltic up to 1996 . #% What was everybody 's business was nobody 's business . #% How much innovation has taken place in the Commission , or indeed in the Parliament may I say ? #% The most remarkable thing about the budget for 1995 - by contrast with national budgets , which are plagued with overspending - is that we turn out 13 % below our commitments . #% The non-gainful employment of women and men who , for instance , educate children , care for the elderly at home , provide inter-generational solidarity and work for the common good , is still not considered economic work to this day . #% We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links . #% Indeed , one is tempted to say that such is the EU 's apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations . #% ` Where there is a will there is a way ' . #% Secondly , there can not be a reform of the EU Structural Fund programmes unless there is a continued commitment to financially supporting the four Cohesion Fund countries . #% The preferred weapons of terrorism are a few ounces of semtex in a holdall , a motor car , semi-automatic rifles and handguns-look at the experience of terrorism anywhere in the world-these are the weapons that are in use . #% While I am opposed to Amendments 2 , 7 and 12 , my biggest problem is with Amendment 26 , which proposes that all NGOs , regardless of the legitimacy of their interests or the transparency of their constitutions , should be granted the right of unfettered instigation of court proceedings against Community institutions for their administrative acts or omissions , such as in enforcing the implementation of EU environmental law . #% We know , however , that recovery can not happen without pain . #% It is a peripheral area , an Objective 1 area . #% I agree with Mr Bowis . #% It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way at the Madrid Conference in October 1999 , which enshrined the principle of exchanging land for peace . #% Those we are making agreements with have to appreciate that we are serious . #% Genetic engineering makes it possible to achieve these aims more efficiently and in a much shorter time than by conventional propagation . #% It is of utmost importance that Europe gains economic stability . #% There is a major problem with rewarding the law-breakers . #% Our Northern Ireland colleagues know this very well working as they do among the local communities . #% We note also with satisfaction the evolving situation in Slovakia and the renewed interest of Malta . #% I demand an international force in Gaza . #% For example , Mr Tappin , I would point out that a small road building contractor in Ireland that wins small-scale contracts from local authorities would find it absolutely impossible to bid for larger-scale construction projects for major roadways or motorways because it could not afford the investment required for the quantity of equipment needed to complete the job . #% I do not find that to be an acceptable explanation . #% The European Union must also take steps to restore the confidence of consumers and producers in beef as a healthy , safe and marketable product . #% We want to ensure that they do have a right to grow bananas , in particular in the interests of the many people involved in banana production in those countries . #% Finally , as a result of the Court of Auditors ' decisions , we must ensure that our accounting and delivery practices are better , to ensure that all students can benefit not only from a tremendous academic achievement but also from a cultural experience . #% We should ensure that the rules and regulations that we set down guarantee that those innovators have those protections and have those rights . #% The wording is now clearer in terms of many crucial aspects : the basic principle that human body parts , be they tissues or cells , must not be treated like some commercially tradable product . #% Mr President , the Israeli defence forces are currently continuing with the largest incursion into Gaza since the beginning of the Intifada and death tolls are continuing to rise . #% Could he explain why it has taken so long to complete the building ? #% I must say that I have been highly impressed by the efforts of so many people , and in particular I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Sacconi , the shadow rapporteurs , the chairman of our group , Mr Florenz , the Commission and the Council , and all who have compromised to bring about this package . #% It is also important that the European Commission strictly adheres to enforcing the principle of additionality through uniform verification methods . #% However , if one reads the report , I would put it to the Commissioner that the plainest message that comes from the report in respect of Italy - and this is the major sensitive political question for next year - is that it gives a clear economic policy message that the one-off adjustments in the budget are masking the need for further economic policy change . #% 
But once again simplifying the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be welcomed and therefore we will not be opposing this report . #% I fully support the objective of the regulation and we must agree on a timetable to implement noise standards , but it must be one based on objective performance criteria and not design criteria . #% Madam President , firstly , I wish the Swedish Presidency every success in the knowledge that their success will certainly be Europe 's success as well . #% We need to consider whether it is acceptable that the alcohol industry can advertise in such a carte blanche fashion . #% The European Union must continue to use every diplomatic avenue open to it to help halt the war in Chechnya . #% I urge Members of this House to give it that time and to give it every means at the disposal of this Parliament to complete its work . #% One of the things we are told about CCCTB is that it will be more efficient and that it will simplify matters . #% I understand that many people have deep reservations about aspects of what this final statute may contain . #% It included a coalition of industry , waste-management , local and national authorities , environmental , health and consumer interests . #% However , I believe it is up to the British Government to regulate on this issue , not the European Union , to ensure firms and government bodies live up to their payment obligations . #% I should inform the House that Turkey is not a member of the European Union and therefore we are not in a position to dictate to them how they conduct their affairs or to share with them , in the way we might share with Member States , a pooling of consensus on the way we approach problems . #% The Irish presidency will explore through this group the extent to which the basis for an agreement exists among partners and will endeavour to secure a decision . #% The American Government talks about saving civilisation - a 200-year-old civilisation or a 5000-year-old civilisation ? #% The heads of state and government must first of all allay the fears which have been raised and in this regard the efforts to develop a stability pact are welcome . #% I also deplore their attitude towards the Rational Planning Directive which is a piece of legislation which would allow us seriously to tackle the question of energy efficiency in the distribution sector . #% Mr President , you have made a great start . #% Is this the Pauline Green who , in January , defended collegiality ? #% I am a little concerned about it . #% In this policy of buying , on behalf of Community fleets , fish from third countries , I often ask myself whether it might not be better to spend the money in another way , in the interests of the regions which we set out to help . #% The report is timely and Mr Maaten 's observations are very welcome . #% It is no great victory for Irish fishermen , because there will be no fish to catch ! #% I think everything is contained within this overall report to ensure that we can give those guarantees to individuals . #% We have spent the last three or four years talking about cutting back on spending at European level , freezing the budget and maintaining the present rate of spending . #% So our approach must be proportionate , particularly when we realise that every minute two children in Africa die of malaria . #% As my European Parliament colleagues will know , the Fisheries Committee has been a strong supporter of technical conservation measures based on technical and scientific data . #% Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains . #% If we really wanted action on Gaza , we would use the power that this trade gives us by imposing economic sanctions . #% Virtually all of us have used them and come into contact with them . #% Remember : that it was not the people who created this major problem for society ; it was a lack of vision on the part of politicians and planners . #% Human rights lobbyists I have spoken to contend that much of the reforms in Romania are of the ` smoke and mirrors ' variety and that the theory does not always translate into real progress on the ground . #% It is in every fisherman 's interest that future stocks are protected and , if we must have controls , then let the industry be part of the decision-making process . #% But if they do not do that they become flaccid , rot and become totally useless - just another expensive quango , not actually achieving any great results . #% The committee certainly wants to see SOLVIT strengthened . #% I think it is undoable , because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks . #% Through greater coherence in terms of bench-marking , sharing best practice and improving strategic cooperation and coordination , the EU can be an important factor in releasing a new economic dynamic . #% If tachograph legislation could be rigorously applied would we need the amendment before us , would we need to double the lorries and trucks on the road with the consequent environmental impact ? #% It should include incentives allowing the Member States to clearly support advantages for the regions , especially rural areas , in respect to labour intensive green production . #% I also believe that there should be an opportunity in the future for this House , through its own committees and the plenary , to debate the activities of Europol on an annual basis . #% Were others notified ? #% A lot is riding on that and failure would have disastrous consequences for the region as a whole and for Europe . #% It is Parliament which is speaking for the citizen and taking up the issues of all our citizens , businesses , consumers , workers and the unemployed . #% This cheating of the regions has gone on for years . #% Please do not send us down that road again . #% Commissioner , I say this regardless of precedent or quoting interinstitutional agreements , because I would like to say yet again on the record that , just a few weeks after you were appointed , Commissioner , at the conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in relation to climate change , COP 10 , you made great strides in including the Members of the European Parliament , both before and after various meetings , in terms of full briefings . #% The truth is that we ban American beef today because those hormones are there ; but the truth is also that we know that , if we allowed the Americans to sell that beef into our market , at good value to our consumers , and if we were to put a label on it saying those hormones were there , they would still buy it . #% We are spreading our net a lot wider this time , hopefully not too thinly . #% In conclusion , I am pleased that the recent uncertainty regarding the timetable for enlargement , which was partly due to our rejection of the Treaty of Nice in the first Irish referendum , has been removed . #% These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps . #% This has been done in a rather sly , hypocritical and misleading way in that not simply different dates , but also different procedures -- with stem cell lines and not with embryos -- have been proposed . #% Also why not ask the passengers rather than assuming that their needs will be known ? #% I must , however , stress that we are only halfway there . #% But there still remain areas of difference between us . #% Mr President , I can safely say that we in Ireland have been proud of our Irish presidency and of our Taoiseach in the role of President . #% Mr President , military intervention should only be used as a last resort and to use it now in Iraq would be premature and unjustified , with far-reaching consequences beyond its immediate target . #% I believe that the Leader programme has in the main been successful and it should be developed to achieve more at local level . #% Mr President , it is a matter of very great concern that the security situation in Iraq has deteriorated very badly in recent weeks . #% Mr Swoboda has called for more obvious public perception of our role in the area . #% In 50 years ' time he will be feted for that ; it is one of the bulwarks of democracy . #% Tax incentives , increased aid in respect of land use to grow energy crops , and the focused use of Structural Funds : all have a part to play . #% There will , however , always be a small number of people in any country who are prepared to abuse a system . #% Because of that complexity , plus the changes in nomenclature , the activity-based budgeting and enlargement , it has been a difficult task to give an overall view . #% Mr President , I too would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur , and to the draftsman from the Committee on Legal Affairs , with regard to the proposal put before us . #% It is easier for us in the institutions to advocate these things ; we are expected to do so . #% The regulators failed . #% It is growing in reach and is affecting young girls and women in particular . #% All of this begs the question : what can the European Union do ? #% 
Always presuming in the first place that the scientists have been looking for the stock in the right areas . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am pleased to learn from the Commissioner that screening the accession chapters relating to Iceland , which began in November of last year , is expected to be completed shortly . #% Studies have shown that babies - the most vulnerable members of society - are at risk . #% What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular . #% This Commissioner 's role would be to promote the dialogue about that philosophy and to help create a world in which there is no longer any war or any conflict . #% They put it better than I can , how children are excluded from EU policy and how laws and policies that the EU makes have a very real impact on children ' s lives , an impact that is different from that on adults . #% Its proposed premium period of ten years is far too short and its proposed grant rate is too low . #% Mr President-in-Office , I thank your for that very detailed response . #% National interests must be protected during this phase of negotiations as an overburdened bureaucracy at EU level is not the desired outcome from these IGC talks . #% There is also a strong recommendation to provide consumers with manufacturers ' contact addresses where goods are sold in several Member States . #% When we understand that , we will treat each other and ourselves like the masterpiece that we are and we will realise our shared responsibility for each other 's safety . #% Ireland fits somewhere between the continental European social model and the Anglo-Saxon model . #% On these issues , there has been no rapprochement . #% Raytheon has been welcomed to Derry by no less than Nobel Peace Prize winners , John Hume - one of our own colleagues , and David Trimble . #% The ELDR believes that the Santer-led caretaker Commission has lost its political and moral authority to act and so it must go immediately and be replaced by an interim Commission for the balance of its unexpired term . #% It is crystal clear that the species is under threat of extinction unless decisive action is taken . #% The problems start when the animal leaves the farm , goes to a haulier and moves onward . #% Secondly , will outside technical assistance be used in the operation of the programme ? #% Unfortunately , the press ignores the real work of this Parliament , the serious work that it undertakes , be it on foreign policy , be it on the promotion of human rights and democracy and , indeed , on other issues , and they will concentrate on these sorts of issues . #% I support closed boxes such as the recent Celtic Sea cod box , which , though difficult , has been supported by fishermen . #% We need to ensure that education is fully integrated and allows people with disabilities not to be segregated , but to be educated along with everyone else . #% So they used a national student ID card which was valid but this was refused . #% Of course it will be costly but what price do you put on the life of a child who may be knocked down on the road , or a patient in hospital who may receive wrong treatment as a result of the fatigue of a doctor ? #% We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle , once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia . #% One of the fundamental characteristics of temporary protection is that it is not a right established by any international instrument . #% Council Directive 2000/78/EC rightly prohibits religious discrimination in employment . #% Technology , telecommunications and transport have made the world a much smaller place . #% Agreement on the financial aspects of enlargement has removed the last major obstacle which stood in the way of concluding the accession negotiations with ten countries at the December Copenhagen Council . #% Perhaps they are telling me whoppers in my home country ! #% If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy . #% Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s . #% It is a complex and very un-user-friendly piece of legislation regulation at the moment . #% We in the PSE Group will not support amendments on ethics , but we appreciate the declaration which has been brought forward . #% It is important that negotiations between Israel and Syria should resume quickly and that the Lebanese track of the Middle East peace process should also be addressed . #% That said , it is extremely unsatisfactory for us , as legislators to have been asked to rush through such a technical piece of legislation . #% In good conscience , I ask people to vote yes and I myself , in good conscience , shall vote yes . #% Why then , for example , do imported cars - which now represent over 70 % of the UK market - get dearer as the pound is getting stronger ? #% Be that as it may , the harsh reality is that farmers who are guarantors of food supply and quality are devastated , their incomes eliminated and the ethos of farming desecrated through the destruction of a prime food product . #% It is unbelievable . #% Global leader in military power he may be , but he is a global dunce in citizenship and respect for others . #% The European textile industry has global advantages and these must be developed and strengthened . #% IRA terrorists Monaghan , Connolly and McCauley were duly convicted of training FARC guerrillas in Colombia . #% We must therefore avoid crippling small and medium-sized European industries with over-stringent obligations and regulations . #% And yet they are being inexplicably excluded from the proceedings . #% Finally , the Commission has already stated that action to uphold international agreements with the EU , and I am quoting , `` does not represent a sanction against Israel but demands correct implementation of existing agreements freely entered into by the parties '' . #% I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy . #% In conclusion , we must reappraise the proposals in Agenda 2000 for Europe 's beef sector and , in the context of world trade talks , provide a greater degree of protection and opportunity for Europe 's beef farmers . #% The programmes in place have the potential to help , but that help must be easier to obtain . #% Foreign policy hawks in the US Administration would do well to remember that the roots of current world crises relating to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden are a product of past dubious US foreign policy decisions . #% If we regard these issues as merely domestic , as has been reflected in national legislation on many issues regarding the family , then we do ourselves and the people of Europe a gross injustice . #% I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan . #% But it is there . #% Despite what some may say , these actions have been successful in helping to reduce the supply , exchange information on best practice and intelligence on the activities of drug trafficking and drug dealers . #% We need proper research centres to be set up to ensure that the real effects of this kind of non-ionizing radiation are properly examined by independent assessors . #% The Commission has expressed concern over recent years about the IMF 's macro-economic framework for low income countries . #% On the one hand I feel considerable relief : it looks as though if Parliament concurs we have an agreement . #% It is extremely important that , in the tackling of poverty reduction , education is given a high priority . #% The importance of this ILO Convention is that it will provide legal recognition of domestic work as work . #% It was the first time that there was a formal meeting of defence ministers , and the decisions that were taken were historic . #% We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time . #% Therefore , a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector . #% Creating a Community of 25 countries will eventually involve close to a 30 % increase and will have serious implications for the annual budget . #% Both the young and the elderly experience different forms of age discrimination , particularly as regards access to the labour market and certain social services . #% I am not totally convinced that Commissioners Flynn and Bonino would agree with your very restrictive interpretation of this Court ruling . #% The real issue at stake , which is totally lost in this report , is that nobody can communicate in confidence any more . #% Discrimination on the grounds of age is one of the aspects covered in this regard in the Irish presidency paper . #% 
First and foremost it must restate the commitments to establish a single currency in 1999 and the advantages which this currency will bring to most of Europe 's citizens . #% The distribution of direct payments in Ireland may be more equitable than in other EU countries , as there are relatively few very large farms , particularly arable farms . #% The Guardian also reports that the German Government has promised Miss McAliskey that , if extradited , she would be able to take her child with her . #% We in Ireland must achieve these targets in terms of managing our packaging waste and waste in general . #% We are breathing new life into the Western European Union , which should have actually been defunct last year . #% In return we will support you as critical friends . #% It is perceived as one of the big Member States using bully-boy tactics to impose its will to the detriment of a small nation such as Ireland or Portugal . #% I would ask the President-in-Office if he could provide a clear timetable as to when the reprocessing trade will be brought to an end . #% We do not claim the status of ` primus inter pares ' but we expect and demand to be treated as an equal among equals in the European institutions . #% The Commission outlined with clarity that EFSA , the European Food Safety Authority , has said there are no safety issues involved . #% The Council recommendation to the House , consistent with the Treaty , commends a term of office of eight years for Mr Wim Duisenberg as nominee for Central Bank presidency . #% Mr President , at the end of July and the beginning of August 2003 I attended the summing-up of the trial in Bogota of three Irishmen accused of training the FARC in Colombia . #% I feel that not enough has been done at a political level , either by the European Union or the Member States , to deal with the issue of congestion in our skies . #% I can give her more information on that later . #% That the euro may suffer from a popularity deficit in some countries in the eurozone should come as no surprise . #% Taoiseach , you have proven your skills as a negotiator , as somebody who understands the difficulties each country faces , particularly when discussing the Constitution . #% Mr President , the report we are discussing here today is very much an interim report into the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society in Britain . #% This is the overwhelming view of the vast majority of European Union Governments as well as being the strong opinion of the European Parliament . #% The amnesty granted by King Sihanouk refers only to this conviction and makes no reference to future convictions and therefore it is important that he is tried . #% There is nothing to stop others being more ambitious in achieving delivery . #% I want to ask the Commission when we can expect to see a proposal for a directive on organ transplants . #% It further condemns the attacks on civilians as documented by the International Crisis Group . #% While such policies are relevant to all rural women , I want to specifically refer to the often forgotten role of women in agriculture . #% This vote opens the door to further aggressive marketing on food products which is not backed up by sound scientific evidence . #% However , I am bound to say in respect of the issues under review to do with fraud , corruption and mismanagement that tonight 's contribution fell short of being a tour de force . #% Mr President , terrorism is the destruction of democracy . #% Finally , there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force -- notably Austria and Denmark -- would be allowed to keep those measures , or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases . #% Is it not time that we really got serious about this ? #% Finally , I would add that the EU fund should also be available to the many other victims of the IRA , who for years have been denied justice because of this same intimidation . #% They do not hurt the elite of the state on which the sanctions are imposed . #% The Nitrates Directive fails to take account of climate or soil conditions in Member States . #% It is consistent with the principles espoused by Labour and social democratic parties across Europe . #% As someone said a few years ago in my own country : when there are as many incompetent women in roles of power as there are men , then we will have true equality . #% Mr President , we are all agreed that Mr Schulz has produced an excellent and comprehensive report on the measures which need to be taken to combat child sex tourism and to reinforce the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children . #% One central feature of this report was that a reformed CAP should be simplified and the policy streamlined . #% Blocking off the supply of funds to terrorist organisations and their associates is one of the most important means at our disposal in dealing with the Al-Qaida networks . #% The United Nations is the body that commands the support and goodwill of the broader international community . #% She has done some very good work . #% Mr President , Commissioner , last month in the emergency debate on foot-and-mouth I indicated that it was not a time for apportioning blame and indeed I sympathised with the plight of British farmers . #% With these few words , I would like to wish the discussions , if they do take place , all success and genuinely hope that they lay the basis for permanent peace in the Middle East . #% In dispensing that money , we could offer to the children of many Third World countries something like the hope that we can give to our own children , something like the life expectancy and opportunities for education . #% In addition to questions relating to the sovereignty and security between Israel and Lebanon , the return of refugees will be of particular concern to Lebanon , whose ethnic balance is disturbed by the fact that there are 250,000 Palestinian refugees on its territory . #% I am more interested in the originality or old age of the ideas of these three individuals rather than their chronological age . #% We , who share in the wonderment of our creation , must act now in the interests of mankind . #% However , on this occasion , the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord . #% The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the peace treaty at Camp David in 1979 . #% Young male drivers , for example , face insurance costs at least twice as high as in other European countries , and that is on top of the higher car prices in Ireland anyway . #% It is discourteous to Members and interrupts the debates . #% We want to ensure that the mistakes that were made then are not made again . #% Our indigenous fossil fuel supplies -- peat and natural gas -- have been rapidly depleting since 1995 , while record economic and industrial growth has pushed up demand . #% The research is quite alarming and I hope that colleagues who like to smoke will respect the health of everybody else by refraining from doing so within Parliament , except in the very limited areas where smoking is permitted . #% However , I wish to begin by saying that I absolutely deplore the way this House has been used this morning , in this debate , to fight national political elections . #% So far I can not see how training compensation is going to deliver that . #% It is important that we clarify for the public the distinct functions of the two institutions and press for more publicity and a more effective information policy for both the Ombudsman 's office and Parliament 's petition process . #% Mr President , the first ever nation-wide electoral process in the history of Saudi Arabia is under way , with the local elections in Riyadh completed last month and continuing in the rest of the country until April . #% Mr President , on a lighthearted note may I firstly say that I am extremely pleased to be here to witness the discovery of the feminine side of your personality , revealed to us this morning . #% Every Member State has its own sneaky little tricks for making sure that people do not find it too easy to go to other countries and practice their professions . #% Therefore , a roundtrip will incur a fee of EUR 300 as a result of this legislation . #% In most cases , ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect the interests of farmers and consumers and the formulations of the manufacturers . #% This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010 . #% Promoting social and educational interaction between students can only serve a positive function . #% The EU 's credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it can not mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational . #% In the intervening period we have observed that other countries of the European Union , by going their separate ways , have in a rather roundabout way put the Single European Act into effect . #% The only way forward for any just society in this day and age should be to promote the policy that the Irish Government has endorsed . #% The telecoms revolution has created a rise in consumer expectations . #% The people of Ireland are fed up with pious assurances from BNFL and the British government about safety standards at Sellafield . #% 
My country , which is a small island , can not solve or undertake to tackle climate change alone , just like any other country . #% New research in this area will contribute significantly to its future development . #% Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit , expectations have not been met . #% However , in Northern Ireland there is a feeling that neither the United Kingdom Government nor the European Union are looking at it favourably , as compared with other languages . #% Access to documents from a Member State that are classified as secret may be granted only where that Member State has given its prior agreement . #% The mining industry has got away with it for far too long . #% Rare though they are for obvious reasons , the potential consequences to very large numbers of people are extremely serious . #% It is imperative for all of us in this House , if possible , to avoid a second reading . #% With modern technology and proper animal coding , this procedure , as we now know , is possible and is already considerably advanced in my own country , Ireland , where we have pioneered a traceability programme in the lamb trade - the first within the European Community . #% Personally I do not have any difficulties with the morning-after pill . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his tremendous work on this report . #% Is it possible to look at competencies , the role of national parliaments and the role of the charter and not change the content of the Treaty ? #% I am not arguing for revision of the Maastricht convergence criteria , but I feel greater acknowledgement should be given to the ` E ' in EMU . #% Unfortunately we have to make this a criminal offence because of the frequent reluctance of people to obey court orders where children and the custody of children are concerned . #% The last one was in Beijing in January and I wish to ask the Commission representatives present here today when is it intended to have the next such meeting ? #% Let us give meaningful expression to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which is the right to life . #% Many practitioners of conventional medicine realize that traditional medicine has a lot to offer and reasonable , independent-minded people must realize that our whole future health and well-being undoubtedly lies in a good mixture of the two . #% The Commission proposal , which makes it possible to sell chocolate with vegetable fat in all 15 Member States instead of the present 7 , is , in my view , to be commended , thus allowing the internal market to function properly . #% But , given that the IRA has benefited to the tune of EUR 40 million from its Northern Bank robbery , it would be an odious scandal if state legal aid were available to anyone to defend such proceedings . #% If Mr Cohn-Bendit has passion in abundance at the moment , perhaps he would direct some of it to his Green colleagues from my country who are trying to convince the electorate that they should vote against the Treaty of Nice . #% If this had been the case , I would have voted in favour of endorsing the new treaty . #% This is a very serious matter , for the use of selective fishing gear occupies a prominent place in both the UN Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the FAO code of conduct for responsible fishing . #% CITES is a global conservation agreement on trade in endangered species of wild flora and fauna , which is implemented in the EU through the even stricter EU wildlife trade regulations . #% This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well . #% Fishing is very different from other occupations . #% This is a dramatic statement of the need for responsible and moral financial management . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for all her hard work on this report . #% That policy prolonged the suffering of black people and it was only when the international community was mobilized into taking strong economic measures against South Africa that the apartheid regime crumbled . #% Although criticism was building over nine years of her tenure , the UN structures as they have evolved did not allow any internal investigation of UNICEF . #% We believe the everything but arms move is a good step , although some of us regret the delayed timetable which sends a message of less than complete commitment to the least developed countries in the world . #% EU agricultural export subsidies gravely undermine food security elsewhere , and we have yet to assess the ecological and social impact of our fisheries agreements with developing countries . #% Despite the fact that there has been a change of government , there seems to be no change in policy . #% It is a very serious matter . #% If Madame Garaud is not in a position , for perfectly understandable reasons , to undertake the mission that you have conferred on her , it could be advisable to see if , in such circumstances , an alternative may be found , if only because it is important for the Presidency of this House to be able to assure Members , as I believe we were assured at a prolonged debate of the Conference of Presidents , that you have acted with concern for due process and with propriety at all times . #% There is already a commercial trade in this , which is very reprehensible . #% I believe you should invite the Commissioner to come and give his views on the overwhelming crisis that we are going through at the present time . #% If you get a proper request for an official delegation , can you assure us that you will assent to such a request in view of the particular concerns of Members of this Parliament on humanitarian grounds ? #% Mr President , this has been a week without precedent with the resignation en masse of the European Commission . #% Do not kid yourselves ! #% During the ASEAN January meeting efforts were made by certain foreign ministers to keep human rights off the agenda . #% We have to have regulation , to look at things like public service obligations , important in this field , our cohesion policies , support for smalland medium-sized enterprises . #% It is anticipated that this committee will report back to the Greater London Assembly by the summer . #% Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork 's nomination , one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union . #% Mr President , although the current round of multilateral trade negotiations has been going on since 2001 , the ambition to conclude them this year looks increasingly unobtainable , certainly if we judge it by the incremental effect of Hong Kong . #% Beef prices to farmers are 40 % lower than two years ago . #% On human rights questions , the politics of the issue should be secondary to the need to outline concerns and criticisms -- if they are warranted -- based on credible facts . #% Does the President-in-Office believe that the European Union could channel aid to alleviate starvation more effectively than is now the case ? #% EU citizens were affected by what happened in Chile , citizens from almost every Member State . #% Due to our economic success in recent years , Ireland is set to reach the threshold of 75 % of average per capita GDP . #% Owing to technological progress , those ideas on children 's rights must now also be linked into cyber security , as we have seen the Internet -- despite its wonderful intent , brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all -- being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography . #% Structural Funds are not a factor in these type of packages . #% I would like the services to correct that before the second reading . #% The Amsterdam Treaty was defective in this regard . #% We must ensure that any EU directive tackling this issue contains no loopholes and that it is satisfactorily implemented in all member states . #% In fact , as a member of the Reflection Group , I raised the whole question of the use of passports within the Union . #% Mr President , this has not been a very controversial subject . #% World energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise by 60 % by 2030 . #% I particularly welcome the lower threshold for subsidies and the simplified definitions . #% A reformed CFP should do away with centralised overregulation from Brussels and instead focus on ideas such as how stakeholders can deal with the day to day management of stocks locally . #% I know that no legislation is perfect . #% They must be tackled . #% It is contrary to the principle of proportionality and , most importantly , it is contrary to the rules of the WTO which require the use of performance standards , not design standards , as is the case in this regulation . #% Where will the growth come from and , consequently , where will the jobs come from ? #% As regards the Antarctic , the European Union has no real fishing interests , at least on paper . #% Another point I want to make , as previous speakers have and , I suspect , most of the following speakers will , concerns the importance of this and other fisheries agreements to certain regions of the Community which are heavily dependent upon fishing . #% Fishermen in that area have cooperated fully , as they have this year about the North Sea . #% 
I do not normally put down questions because I do not like to waste time , but I feel very strongly about this issue . #% The Good Friday Agreement is an historic achievement and I wholeheartedly congratulate all those who contributed to it , both Governments and the party leaders , particularly John Hume who has been praised here today , John Alderdice and especially David Trimble who has had the courage to lead Unionism to an honourable deal with their fellow citizens in Northern Ireland . #% I support Turkey 's membership of the EU , but only on the basis that they fulfil the Copenhagen criteria . #% The fact that we are dealing here very often with delicate family matters is very often used by local police forces as an excuse not to become involved in these cases - that these are family matters and should be left to the lawyers to sort out . #% To my colleague and friend the chairman of the Committee , I should warn him that if he goes out to dine with Scotsmen he should not take their yarns about drinking whisky rather than wine too seriously . #% The Commission did not actually deliver on what was promised in relation to the testing ban , as has already been pointed out by Mr Davies . #% The agricultural community is aware that change is on the way with this new agreement , and is currently poised to embrace it . #% I want this House to know that a large number of the people who voted ` no ' believed that they were doing no damage to the interests of the eastern European countries . #% It is their votes that really matter . #% A related issue concerns the budgetary powers of this Parliament , where different suggestions have been tabled to increase and decrease the role of Parliament in this area . #% Each year we have reports in Parliament on this issue but the rights of certain sections of society continue to be ignored . #% in writing . - I voted for the Maňka Report which is the first step in amending the 2010 European Parliament budget seeking additional budgetary and human resources to enable the European Parliament to fulfil its enhanced role . #% We are talking about war and peace . #% in writing . - I support this report , which makes a number of important proposals to tackle the demographic challenges we face in a spirit of solidarity between generations . #% The good news also is that very recently the Council passed the Brussels II Convention . #% Important decisions have to be made in key areas , particularly the social and economic dimension of the common fisheries policy . #% Madam President , I wanted to know if the Commissioner could answer my question on the positive list , please , and whether it will survive the fourth reading in the European Court of Justice . #% However , due to dubious and complex ` fine print ' , theses schemes then proceed to harass people for money in an extremely threatening and malicious manner . #% Fortunately , there was a real sense in the committee that this must change , that priority must be given to approaches to treatment that enable people to achieve remission and recovery , as well as to inclusion , the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health . #% Farming is one of the oldest , most basic and most essential activities . #% President-in-Office , too much of what we want to say is lost in Jesuitical sophistry in our text . #% I will start with trade . #% I very much support the eEurope initiative which focuses on promoting broadband usage and which concentrates on those areas where the public sector can make a difference . #% We know , obviously , that where they have been tried they have worked well - the tax differentials on leaded and unleaded petrol are a classic example . #% I refer to Annex VI on the restrictions on the movement of equidae in this area . #% I hope the IGC will redress this anomaly . #% Maybe the answer will come from the next two speakers . #% The Community has agreed to several international instruments which seek to control fishing capacity and/or fishing effort . #% Yet , what do we discover ? #% The Summit was unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome on a target for increasing the share of renewable energy in global energy production . #% For that I warmly congratulate you . #% I repeat my specific request to the Irish presidency in July to prioritize the inclusion of a chapter in the Treaty containing provisions relating to the human rights of minors so that they would be entitled in the same way as any other citizen to enjoy fully the fundamental rights , freedoms and protection recognised by the Community , barring those restrictions , of course , laid down by the law specifically for children . #% Could this outbreak have been prevented ? #% The fact that the Irish presidency has highlighted the drugs issue and that all of the Members who spoke here this morning , nearly the majority , considered drugs a priority issue to be tackled by this presidency in an effective way gives carte blanche to the Irish presidency to go ahead and deal with this issue as they see fit . #% At least that is what this report is saying , and I think that makes sense . #% In underlining that point I would ask the Members of the House to support this particular compromise resolution . #% I welcome this report and I look forward to the discussion that will follow and the eventual policy we can redesign around those proposals . #% In view of this democratic deficit , I must be thankful that we have an Ombudsman to fight our corner -- a corner that , in a democracy , we should be able to fight ourselves . #% We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers , who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals . #% All these systems should be linked to a modern rail network with up-to-date rolling stock . #% It is clear that there is a close link between poverty , economic and social development , and bush meat consumption . #% I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit , but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties . #% The proposed European Aviation Safety Agency will need this kind of data if it is to carry out its work effectively . #% The Irish rate of VRT has been sanctioned under EU law . #% The Irish people has spoken on Nice and its decision will be respected . #% I encourage the Council , the Commission and indeed the UN to act and take this resolution seriously . #% By bringing the killers of Robert to justice , there is a bigger statement being made in terms of a total rejection by all decent people of this continued wanton killing , maiming and violence . #% Mr President , when we talk about human rights we have to talk about the right for everybody to be treated equally , both before the law and in society itself . #% It is very timely , therefore , that this summit will be addressing key environmental issues which need to be tackled , both within the Union and in a more global context . #% I should like to commend their courage and tenacity . #% Mr President , regarding Mrs Lynne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower . #% We must be consistent in our approach to terrorism . #% It is vital that these regions continue to retain objective 1 status if they are to achieve the same level of growth as other regions within the European Union . #% However , I am concerned and disappointed that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation . #% I acknowledge that last October they ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination on all Forms of Discrimination against Women . #% Mr Piétrasanta has made an excellent analysis of the new tasks of the JRC as a technical reference body and a support mechanism for decision-making . #% We have got a new word in our vocabulary now : the ` Belarus necklace ' , applicable to a generation of children have had their throats slit from ear to ear to deal with their thyroid cancer . #% They did not know the source of the bubonic menace and were unable to halt it in its deadly tracks . #% Enlargement of the Union is essential for the stability of Europe . #% It is an absolute tragedy that the European Union is moving in this direction . #% I note that with some conviction and with much right on his side , he has recited for us many of the accomplishments of the College which , as President , he has the privilege of leading . #% Its operation will clearly be fragmented and distorted if national governments within the EU have to contribute 25 % of all CAP payments to their respective farmers . #% While I do not support the return to routine or preventive vaccination , a review of vaccination policy is very appropriate , especially the use of emergency or fire-break vaccination to control the spread of an outbreak . #% The UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa is to visit six drought-stricken countries in the region from 6 to 16 September , and I understand that representatives of WHO , the UN Children 's Fund and the Food and Agricultural Organisation are expected to join the mission . #% One of the ideas to emerge is the question of data retention . #% It is essential that we learn from past experience and insist on openness and transparency . #% 
However , this does not preclude the Member States from identifying those areas where there are difficulties in cooperation between Member States and finding ways to improve such cooperation . #% However , despite President Barroso 's reassurances , I am somewhat concerned at the attempts being made by people within the Commission and within this Parliament , in preparation for the Hong Kong round of talks , to demand more of European farmers . #% It is reckoned that approximately EUR 2.5 billion will be lost by the European aviation industry between now and the end of the year , and that some 20 000 jobs will be lost . #% However , the proposal that judicial cooperation in the field of civil matters should be governed by qualified majority voting is contentious . #% Asbestos is a silent , invisible killer . #% I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment . #% If we take municipal waste for example , what we produce is far in excess of the targets set in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme . #% It is unacceptable that we sit back here in the European Union and do nothing about it . #% In my opinion , the real key to preventing injury and promoting safety is the value we place on the human person . #% To keep my record clean I should say that my question has already been asked by Mr Howitt . #% The Berlin Summit of 25 March was a good summit . #% Some of the best travel agents who have served the Members of this House are going to leave . #% The current unfavourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular , the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers , the decline in the number of full-time farmers and the consequent ageing of those who remain - these are all general trends which underline the problem . #% I have just two very brief questions to ask him on this point . #% It is clear that significant efforts are needed in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey . #% Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue . #% And instead of being the puppet of Israel , they should join with us in an even-handed policy approach to the tragedy in the Middle East . #% But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders , deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade . #% If we truly believe and truly want a common statute there should be no transitional system . #% It is time to reinstate Irish fisherman as stewards of Irish waters . #% I am glad , but slightly concerned , that they were unanimous because they might not be taking seriously what is being required of them . #% In that way , if people look at the screen to see how we voted , they will not know . #% This report deals with the important broad issue of handling mercury in import , export and the storage of the substance , while giving a timeline for export and import bans . #% This would provide for codecision with this Parliament in any further legislation they bring forward in this area . #% Equally scandalous is the attitude of the Council of Ministers towards SAVE II in its budgetary suggestions . #% In relation to the matters raised by Mr Paisley : those are dealt with adequately in the agreement and the task of us all is to implement all aspects of that agreement and for all parties to do it together . #% One issue raised is the need to ensure that the citizens of all 25 states who are resident in Member States other than their own are entitled to vote . #% It is extremely important , if this House is to demonstrate its relevance to the lives of the citizens of Europe , that we should use our influence to save these jobs and to ensure that the Commission does not apply rigid , ideologically-based guidelines in the current situation . #% The question is : Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity ? #% We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49 , while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest , as long as the rules are necessary , proportionate and non-discriminatory , i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators . #% Each country has its own menu of special cases , be they young farmers , disease issues , early farm retirement issues , successor rights and those who invested heavily in the reference years . #% This proposal supplements the existing EC legal framework , under which the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation , applies only to employment , occupation and vocational training . #% We must make sure that the actions we take will reverse the declines in several cod stocks and northern hake and allow them to recover . #% But those working in general and the capacity of those out of work to get a sustainable job are in part tied up with this question because telecoms , energy , transport , and post are all essential cost structures within the private sector , for which the traded public service sector is critically important in efficiency terms . #% I would ask you , as you have always done in the past , to find the time for an emergency debate on this matter . #% We need more flexibility to manage unforeseen changes in global trade . #% What is required here is cool heads , dialogue , reconciliation and a respect for the equality of each group to have their own viewpoint , to put forward their own beliefs and to put forward their own ideas for the future . #% Furthermore , a timescale has to be brought in . #% The most recent came in 1968-69 , and the most deadly in 1918-19 : the so-called Spanish flu pandemic . #% Today 's comedy of errors and misjudgments would be gravely compounded if the error of naming Mr Giansily for expulsion was on some technicality to be followed through . #% I therefore welcome today 's debate and I welcome the positive contribution we are trying to make in combating unemployment . #% For example , if one types in Tiananmen Square in China , one is likely to get an architectural history of the buildings around the square . #% I say to the critics : is it more important to feed the seals or to feed human beings ? #% The decisions will have a direct and immediate effect on the citizens of the Union , whether our farming and fishing communities , those in industry - large and small , rural and urban communities and those who live in the less-developed regions and islands . #% Nobody is questioning the existence of the state . #% As a German Member of Parliament told me : `` Professor Raftery is right , but there is a wave of hysteria in Germany so I must vote against him '' . #% It was a particularly bad season for the Commission and a particularly difficult time to proceed through all the normal channels since we had elections , Commission difficulties , and so on . #% While we have managed to reach consensus on issues such as pay and taxation , the question of employee consultation within firms has not yet been adequately explored . #% That is a political , not a technical , decision . #% By allowing more ambitious legislation in some Member States , subject to the close scrutiny of the Commission , and by restricting the marketing of certain products where better alternatives exist , the objectives just mentioned will be given impetus . #% We have good people and bad people . #% Mr President , I spent last week in Turkey with members of the Human Rights Subcommittee . #% On the matter of a referendum I accept his explanation . #% This particular proposal aims to establish a single legal framework to clarify conditions for treating animal by-products . #% I think it is very difficult for many people in our inner city areas to understand why they can not get access to money - over 120 million pounds - which is very badly needed . #% . I commend the rapporteur for her tremendous work on this vital subject . #% There are so many issues before us . #% I know that colleagues in Parliament are more than willing to contribute to such an exercise . #% However , as many speakers have said , despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission 's good faith regarding lifelong learning , there is a lack of commitment on financial resources . #% On a separate but related matter , I was quite disturbed to read that depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Irish Sea by British Ministry of Defence forces at the Solway Firth between England and Scotland and also at a range on the Cumbrian coast , just seven miles from a British nuclear plant . #% The latest text allows a situation whereby the collection of fees will continue to apply to those activities that are currently subject to fees -- i.e. meat and fishery products inspection , veterinary residue testing , and controls on live animals . #% That is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the United Kingdom . #% We look , too , at the great tenacity you have displayed in the past 30 years in trying to find peace . #% Protection of juveniles is equally important and must be one of our priorities . #% This is unusually good working together . #% We look forward to regular reports from the Commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project . #% 
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole . #% The proposed directive focuses only on Member States who are active participants in the production of nuclear energy . #% It is very important that homeopathy should also be included as a medical treatment within this European Community action plan on public health . #% I urge the Commission to be equally positive and to let us know today if they will support an IGC inclusion of children in treaties and an European Union initiative on Internet , to prevent the dissemination of paedophile information . #% Finally , we must play a greater and clearer role as regards the place within society of those with disabilities . #% While I have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture , equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from BSE . #% Moving to the future , for the future we must double our efforts to eradicate the last remnants of this disease and restore public confidence in the high quality of our food products . #% Rather than being bogged down in mere politics , let us look to the bigger picture . #% The ELDR group pledges itself to that task . #% This is about Brazilian beef coming into Europe . #% The proposal to amend the original directive on this matter will ban the marketing of toys and childcare articles containing PVC which are designed to be placed in the mouths of children under the age of three . #% In Spain the situation has not changed . #% We have to keep that separate . #% Mr President , I contest the European Court of Justice decision to annul the second sentence of Article 5 of the working time directive , which specifies Sunday as a rest day . #% Sometimes we get it wrong as legislators and I think Equitable Life might yet prove that . #% I ask the Commission to bring forward further programmes along these lines to tackle this life-threatening problem that faces all of Europe . #% It supports the militarisation of Europe - something I do not support . #% They had seen some evidence of a greater effort by the police force in Northern Ireland to be impartial and helpful to all the citizens . #% It is not the first time a Commission President has attended a G8 meeting , or that a Prime Minister and President-in-Office has attended a G8 or G7 meeting . #% Finally , why is it that the Council as an appropriate body can not work together in exchanging best practices ? - because there are many Member States where there are fantastic second-chance educational facilities that do not seem to be available in other areas . #% I welcome in particular the confirmation by the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers yesterday in Brussels of the full participation of the new Member States in shaping the Treaty that will follow the Convention . #% What better way of doing that than engaging the best brains in Europe on behalf of the people to tackle the problems which worry the people ? #% To prevent a repeat of such a crisis requires a fundamental revision of the financial regulatory framework and this must include a stronger capital framework for banks . #% We are therefore in a stronger position to shape that world , particularly in this very historic week -- who could have dreamt that the whole of Europe would be together ? #% If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries , they will get their supplies from far further afield , with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport . #% It is harder for EU companies to compete with third party countries who do not observe the same safety standards and who can pay employees much lower salaries . #% Mr President , that last contribution is a sad reminder that the doctrine of bigotry is alive and well in certain parts of this Union . #% It is clear that , in the form presented , the mergers and acquisitions ( takeovers ) directive , has now fallen . #% The response to climate change lies in strong international governance and financial commitment . #% He said that the issue of a direct tax was on the table . #% What have we learned from the recent scares such as foot-and-mouth and BSE ? #% There is immense frustration - I am sure not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union - at the scale of distress . #% A recent study by the UK Department for International Development has estimated that 150 million people -- one-eighth of the world 's poorest -- regard wildlife as an important livelihood asset . #% There are onslaughts on farm income from left , right and centre . #% In the first instance Parliament will then need to have the work of that committee returned to it and express political conclusions in a debate in the House . #% The idea was that at the end of each year the amount of carbon dioxide actually emitted had to match the amount of emission permits a company surrendered to its government . #% The US seems unable to pass legislation to curb its excessive CO2 emissions . #% I would also like to stress the importance of the EURATOM Treaty and a review or replacement of that Treaty as part of a common energy policy . #% Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents , in terms of the chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons , radioactive materials and other harmful substances which , because they go largely unnoticed , are a cause of major concern . #% We should all remember that we have a lot to be proud of in Europe at the moment and that the impasse relating to the finalising of a new European Union treaty should not detract from that . #% in writing . - The European Police College ( CEPOL ) , which became an agency in 2006 , has faced severe problems since its creation in abiding by minimum good administration norms to which all EU agencies are submitted . #% I would like to thank the Commission and those staff in its directorates-general who have been patient in their explanations and have explained their rationale for preparing the preliminary draft budget . #% I hope we can take this excellent report on board . #% Let us at least show the next generation that there is more to life than some of the books that are being produced and sold in all our airports . #% Mr President , I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 22 to include the words ` in addition to the North Sea and the Irish Sea ' . #% This institution will work very closely with the Spanish and Danish presidencies of the Union to ensure that enlargement negotiations are a success . #% This will mean , for instance , that in the road transport area there will be three categories of operators : own-account , third party hauliers and self-employed . #% I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency , Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso , to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of Europe that we have a future together . #% Irish and European industries need to be assisted in turning a declining sugar industry into a profitable alternative energy source , such as biofuel . #% Mr President , the principle of eco-labelling is sound . #% One way that we could do this , perhaps on a trial basis , is with a third type of organisation which also incorporates the Economic and Social Committee . #% It is extremely important we have viable and traceable means to ensure that farmers observe any preslaughter waiting-time periods , in particular concerning recreational horses entering the chain for human consumption . #% In 2009 , I had the privilege in becoming the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in Dundalk . #% Poorer regions such as Merseyside in my region , and in the rest of the EU 15 , may continue to need Objective 1 funding , but more importantly than that , today a delegation of trade unionists from Manchester came to Strasbourg to fight to save 650 jobs threatened due to industrial restructuring . #% I repeat the call that the godfathers must not be allowed to remain outside European laws . #% We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws . #% The use of Iraq 's oil revenues must also play a key part in the actual reconstruction of Iraq , but any use of such monies must be undertaken in the best interests of the Iraqi people , who must play a role in any such decisions as fully and as early as possible . #% Farmers also need and want clean water . #% It is a year where the emphasis and the élan which was brought to this task by the Swedish Presidency has borne fruit . #% This not only impinges on the credibility of our economic rules , but it leads to a broader problem of selling a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself . #% The lack of childcare facilities is a very real and fundamental barrier to women taking up employment in the workplace . #% Farmers and rural communities have legitimate expectations , to which Parliament has responded in a positive way . #% We need research and development in the Sixth Framework Programme . #% It will not come as any surprise to you that I fully support the Miguélez Ramos/Kindermann amendment , which is totally consistent with the contents of the report and simply introduces the notion of gender equality in the title . #% Both the Irish and British Governments describe them as two sides of the same coin . #% If not , why not , bearing in mind that this is one of the most controversial issues to be debated by the European Union in many a long day and one in which there is huge public interest ? #% 
It is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse . #% Great credit is due to the Council for taking on board so many of the amendments Parliament sought to bring forward after first reading . #% However , there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular , I want to deal with two aspects . #% Ireland bears witness to this fact and , despite the outcome of the Nice Treaty , Irish people readily acknowledge the benefits of our membership and also support proposals on enlargement . #% Liberalisation leads to a dash for gas , forcing us to import gas from some very fragile regimes . #% The broader behavioural , social and environmental factors that determine health can be optimally addressed at Community level through a holistic , as opposed to fragmented , approach . #% We need to lift the moratorium and have a rational regulatory approach to GM technology to allow consumers to make informed choices . #% This , as I have said on numerous occasions , is something that has never been , is not and never will be acceptable to those of us who are committed to defending farmers with small - and medium-sized farms and our rural communities . #% Will we see to it that these little communities - and they are tiny compared with the big fishing industries of the rest of the Community but vital to us all - are safeguarded ? #% In very simple and blunt terms , we are here today to try and pick up the pieces after what has been a bruising experience for all Member States within the European Union . #% That is good , right and proper . #% If we are going to fight terrorism , we must all work together within the law . #% The European Union 's development aid programmes should include programmes which seek to ensure that women can participate fully in society . #% Mr President , in passing laws which affect people , trade and places , we all have a duty of care and a duty to care . #% This gets round the difficulties that many speakers have referred to in relation to delays with petitions , although I acknowledge that the situation has considerably improved since the committee was recently reorganized . #% This experience has shown that the environmental damage from such a disaster knows no boundaries and respects no frontiers . #% Most of that money was spent on market support in the form of export refunds and storage , which mainly created opportunities for immense schemes of fraud and deception . #% Like everybody else in this Parliament I share those concerns . #% As we know , the vast majority of patients in hospitals are women . #% Mr President , I would like to comment on what was said by some of the earlier speakers here . #% Mr President , the report before us does a great disservice to the topics it covers , whether one is pro-choice or pro-life , because it purports to dictate to Member States a certain direction in relation to what are most important subsidiarity matters for the Member States . #% in writing . - I condemn today 's vote , which narrowly defeated the objection to a misleading health claim by a major manufacturer of baby milk . #% Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years . #% But this touches on something of a very fundamental political nature , and merely technical responses to a record which shows a difference in votes may not be enough . #% It is still the only region in Ireland that retains Objective 1 status , though that , through national economic performance , ceases on 31 December 2006 . #% That is why we , in conjunction with the EDN Group and Mr Macartney , have proposed an amendment calling for a mid-term review of the agreement . #% We must grasp , therefore , the opportunities that are presented by substantial economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions . #% I know France is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in July . #% This can only be achieved by creating a framework for taxes and other levies on pesticides and I support the plan to stop Member States from reducing VAT on pesticides . #% The Union has an unemployment rate of 8 % and the target of full employment is attainable . #% I may be paranoid , but I wonder whether industry is behind this attempt to get a reaction from Members of Parliament . #% If it abolished VRT Irish motorists would have to bear the costs of its abolition by paying a 20 cent increase in the price of petrol or diesel , or an increase from EUR 400 to EUR 900 in their annual motor tax . #% Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that , and so should the consumers . #% Indeed , having been at the centre of compromise , finding and supporting others , I was surprised that my modest proposals did not receive proper consideration . #% Tomorrow , when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion , I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus . #% The Commissioner actually answered my question in the second part of his answer . #% Finally , during the course of these debates our citizens will be expecting clear evidence that the European Union is capable of providing clear-cut and effective solutions to these major political , social and economic problems . #% Mr President , first I all I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their dedication and commitment . #% It is essential that we in Parliament and the Commission , keep our minds , and our ears and our eyes open , for new ways of tackling the unemployment problem . #% His last remarks , as I have said , are about the construction of more nuclear power stations : this is completely inappropriate and nothing to do with the subject he was asked to report on . #% Secondly , if greater efficiency is to be achieved by freeing up the movement of the beet quota , what are your intentions for the milk quota ? #% Commissioner , you will probably be familiar with the resolution that is before you . #% This figure is far higher than the number of people killed in traffic accidents . #% It is very important that consumers are aware well in advance of the actual physical changeover of currency of the real worth of the euro compared with the punt . #% In particular , it is necessary to broaden the partnership to include those sectors that are at present excluded , in particular the SME sector . #% If we are genuine about wanting to encourage firms to improve environmental policy and environmental performance , then it is necessary that the best available technology should be encouraged . #% If the United States and GM multinationals are so concerned about world hunger why do they not put the resources spent on research and PR for GM into helping them fend for themselves , not into forcing them to become even more reliant on multinational companies to grow their own food ? #% Indeed , the fact that 75 % of the complaints the Ombudsman 's office receives do not relate directly to European Union institutions and problems therein is , in my view , not necessarily a bad thing . #% I therefore expect you , Mr President , to accord me the respect of the House and the answer to my question . #% In quarries six miles apart , one in Dundalk and the other in Newry , a European directive is being implemented differently in two Member States . #% Finally , to come back again to the point of Morocco ' s right to make its own decisions . #% Indeed , they were coming so fast at one stage that they were being discarded before they were implemented . #% Authorities are already planning to close down a significant number of currently active landfill sites in Ireland over the next two years . #% Certainly , the auctioning of these licences in Germany and Britain has secured large amounts of money for the respective national exchequers , but who ultimately is going to pay for these phones ? #% I want it to go ahead , but I want to reassure people that adequate measures are being taken at European and national levels to ensure that the SARS virus does not spread . #% I would ask the services to please ensure that we are given a proper voting list tomorrow morning . #% Mr President , it is a matter of regret that Parliament has found it impossible to construct a resolution for today 's debate . #% I believe it is our right to look at issues involving the Structural Funds and I understand you have also written to Member States . #% Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant in the daily lives of their citizens . #% That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority . #% Finally and very importantly , it will also help to dispel the many myths that have grown up . #% That idea has been turned on its head by the economic realities of existing Member States - also by the performances of other Member States , such as in my own country in particular - Ireland , where an aggressive reduction in taxation policy , reducing the cost of labour and the income tax levy and ensuring that business can survive in a harmonious industrial relations environment with the majority of the earnings that the workers are getting going into their pocket and not going into taxation ; while at the same time , increasing the levels of protection that are available for those who are most vulnerable within our society and increasing investments in education and health . #% To date , we have not been able , as has already been said , to develop a marker vaccine capable of controlling the disease . #% The institutions have worked hard to ensure that the burden for industry , and particularly SMEs , is not too costly , will protect confidential business information , reduce red tape and will not threaten jobs , whilst still delivering a win-win situation for citizens , workers and our ecosystem . #% Mr President , I , like my colleagues , would like to congratulate both our rapporteurs on the presentation of their work . #% I have said here before that the poor are used far too often in far too many negotiations . #% 
Mr Pex knows that and has admitted so to me . #% For 90 % of the people , the European Union does not represent a positive image of relevance to them . #% I would like to remind the Council that the mission I led was not a Parliament mission , it was an EU mission consisting of 88 dedicated people , who discharged their task professionally in line with internationally accepted criteria for election observation . #% Looking at some of the suggestions with regard to the maximum levels permitted under the reports , if you just take Ireland as one example , the air quality in Dublin , the capital city , is already meeting the standards that are set down within this report . #% It is my own view that , if there is no measurable progress soon on the demands in this resolution , then the European Union must bring economic and political pressure to bear on the regime in Sri Lanka . #% I will deal with the easy questions first of all and then go on to the more difficult ones facing the summit . #% These are good , decent , nice ideas but they are simply not working . #% We can only recognise the full potential of business-to-consumer e-commerce if sufficient trust and confidence is there . #% We insist on a report back on how the ban is being implemented and action if it is not working . #% I am aware of the report brought forward by Mr Hyland which he has referred to . #% None of our countries can halt these acts on their own . #% I hope that you will encourage cooperation between your staff , scientists and those involved in the industry . #% This approach requires EU farmers to sell their products below the cost of production and depend for their income solely on partial compensation . #% I would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards , because here we received conflicting answers in committee . #% It is a despicable repeat of the most heinous crimes committed during previous conflicts this decade in Yugoslavia . #% Despite this , the RDA for Vitamin E remains a measly 10 IU . #% Evolving players such as South Asia , Latin America and Africa require emission reduction policies that will not harm their economic development . #% We must all work together to put behind us the tragic events that have taken place in the Balkans since the 1990s . #% The announcement was made today in Ireland . #% Presently , many of the more difficult chapters of discussions still remain unopened , and these include agricultural issues , the free movement of persons , the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the incorporation of many EU directives and regulations in the field of environmental matters . #% The allocation of EUR 200 million in European Union aid to help Haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start , but , when the cameras have left and the world 's attention is turned elsewhere , the European Union , as a global leader , must act and live up to its responsibility . #% Secondly , in relation to commitments we are making , I am very glad to hear what the Commissioner had to say about the EUR 200 million which he is forwarding almost immediately . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he thinks that fuel reprocessing at Sellafield can possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero , or virtually nil as he puts it ? #% However , I will not give up on that particular point . #% It must be said that it is typical of its grandstanding that the EU now wants to pontificate on the future of Iraq . #% We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends . #% Two per cent of the current EU research budget for the entire agricultural sector does not facilitate the achievement of this objective . #% The main reason why it is not being implemented is because Member States and national governments are not prepared on many occasions to find the matching funding required to bring about what is necessary to restructure an industry which we all know and agree must be restructured . #% Plants that can not meet rigorous international standards should be decommissioned . #% In 1997 it allocated under ECU 2 million to research in the disease . #% I am also especially concerned that the action plan should be improved to include truly efficient and responsive health monitoring systems . #% We all know that the enlargement process can not take place unless there is some internal reform in the decision-making processes within the EU . #% Mr President , nobody can dispute the need to create a fair global trading system , but we should not delude ourselves in thinking that fully-liberalised trade will in itself bring about fairness . #% Funds will pay the legal bills and that is necessary . #% In fact the Commission proposals represent a reduction on existing grant rates . #% I hope you agree with that . #% Mr President , the fisheries protocol with the Republic of Mauritania is of vital importance for EU fisheries . #% Finally , it must not be a case of the last person off the island turning the lights off . #% Since the Commission is the body which initiates legislation , I urge you , Commissioner , to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up . #% Regarding the Minister 's response , it is quite clear that the Council is playing a role here , in that it is agreeing on the Europol Convention . #% Half of all the money that we provide for the fishing industry goes on these agreements , something like ECU 300 million annually . #% The text before us is a very worthwhile contribution to the future development of rural areas . #% However , the report fails to draw any political conclusions . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in saying that today is a very sensitive occasion for us in Parliament . #% When you actually look at the Commission 's approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years , you will see that the Commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the EU institutions , pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with , of course , the obvious exception of third-country agreements . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - I too want to thank Mr Schwab , and my colleagues in other political groups as well , for the considerable amount of work they have put into this report . #% We have others yet to attain that accolade . #% Specific preventive and protective measures must therefore be taken so as to reduce workers ' exposure to PVC . #% If we just did that , however , and failed to look at energy efficiency and environmental protection , we would end up with a situation which was far worse than the present one . #% In the procedures to date , many of the nominee Commissioners were kind enough to , in effect , promise in advance a charter of reform for their own areas and have alluded to specific policy commitments . #% It is affected by many factors including structural policy which does not take employment into account in issues of vessel size . #% In recent weeks the Israeli foreign minister and the Palestinian leader have visited Parliament . #% I want in particular to assure my colleagues here that the vast majority of men would support them fully in ensuring that they have full equality of rights , parity of esteem and protection against any violence whatsoever . #% It will have an adverse effect on our agriculture , our farmers and our fishermen . #% We must ensure that Iraq is approached in a multilateral way . #% Recently I visited the Dublin Foundation , as a Member representing Dublin . #% Mr President , the application of quality standards and controls is an essential ingredient of Europe 's food sector and , from a consumer perspective , we must be vigilant so as to ensure that all food products meet the most stringent production and market requirements . #% It was high time that these newly-developed fisheries for deepwater species were brought under some sort of control . #% We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy . #% Fishermen want to work with the scientists but the scientists who advise the Commission will not work with them . #% In doing that I hope we will not give the national governments an opportunity to create the impression that the responsibility for high rates of unemployment lies with Europe . #% I believe the resulting text is not only technically workable , but is a good balance between investor protection and easing the access to capital markets for enterprises in Europe . #% in writing . - I support this resolution on Policy Coherence for Development . #% Finally , I am glad , President-in-Office , that you corrected yourself about Irish being a lesser-used language . #% Likewise , there can not be a simple free-market area , where everyone can do whatever they wish , without any restrictions . #% Opportunistic Eurosceptic stances by some of its leading members played into the hands of those who opposed the Treaty of Nice , thereby contributing to its rejection . #% 
Let us get real about this . #% Yesterday I left home at 7 o'clock in the morning and , because of the behaviour of Air France at Charles de Gaulle , I arrived here at 9 o'clock yesterday evening . #% A textbook approach of the kind seen far too often has not always served to meet citizens ' requirements in this important area . #% We can not have a situation such as that which arose this summer , when the sale of 80 to 90 million items of clothing and textiles was blocked in the warehouses of Europe , paralysing European businesses and damaging their trade relations with Chinese counterparts . #% We must promote them . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% It has been proposed that they should be opened up to a number of neighbourhood countries but , given the very good work these programmes have done in encouraging the strengthening of people-to-people contacts , a general consensus should be reached on opening up these programmes more widely , where this can be done effectively . #% The liberalisation of services very often benefits those in areas of dense population at the expense of consumers in less-populated areas . #% Some of the amendments put forward by the rapporteur , such as Amendment No 6 , are too prescriptive , while others such as Amendment No 14 , are too restrictive . #% That should be unthinkable . #% However , a considerable amount is not being distributed , mainly because of the mismatch between the needs of SMEs - refinancing of some sort - and the European Investment Bank objective , which is money for medium-term investment . #% For the continent of Africa this pandemic is already amplifying the impact of famine which is now threatening so many countries in Africa itself . #% This is an airline that has made # IRL 35 million profit in the last year . #% After all the anguish and despair of the last 30 years this is a wonderful tribute to the consistent belief on John Hume 's part that the non-violent path to peace in Northern Ireland was the only way . #% Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks , and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry . #% This enables people to help the environment directly and to reduce emissions in their everyday living and buying . #% Despite all the denials , this Constitution is a framework for superstatehood . #% Coordination within Commission departments and Member State government departments encompassing an integrated approach is key . #% I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament . #% I , along with the people I represent , will take great delight in voting against it . #% -- Mr McCreevy , you did not need to say anything in Sweden . #% Modulation of EUR 5 000 is unacceptable , even with promises of further investment in rural development . #% We rely on the Commissioner to make strong representations to the Chinese Government on the specific concerns raised in this resolution and , indeed , in former recommendations of Parliament , in particular in relation to the Pan Am project and Parliament 's view on the funding of that project . #% There are three points I want to raise . #% Certainly I will ensure that the concerns he expressed are taken into account so far as I can . #% I tabled this question not out of concerns about health or trading issues but out of concern for the credibility of the European Commission . #% The Environmental Committee will continue to play an important coordinating role in this regard and I would congratulate the rapporteur on the report . #% The new paradigm must also necessarily be people-based , reflecting the concept of lifelong learning , investing in adaptability through education and training and investing in self-development and individual opportunity . #% A few years ago a feasibility study was commissioned by the sugar processing sector in Ireland , with a view to producing bio-ethanol using surplus sugar beet . #% If we do not ensure that our systems can be brought together and work in an interoperable way , we are doomed to be less successful than continental blocs such as the United States . #% We think this is a very good starting point , but it should not end there . #% Unless the Israelis and the Palestinians sit down together and work out their problems , nothing we do or say can be more effective than what they can achieve themselves . #% It comes down to the proper screening and treatment of the product regardless of the source . #% However , the growing crisis was concealed from policyholders . #% Why did you not tell it last March ? #% There is no point in us saying that we support Israel or Palestine . #% We have to recall again that no country has ever been defeated by terrorism and I am certainly confident that the terrorism which we now face on an international scale does not have that capacity unless we allow it by failing to grapple with the ideas underlying it . #% That was a mistake and it is to be hoped that there will now be a retreat from that position . #% We fail to mainstream the solutions that various boards and reports have identified . #% There are stories going around at the moment that in Britain they are going to actually block sales to certain countries in the world because of the campaign against the arms trade . #% A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit , and not for the unworkable , unwanted ever-closer union , has some hope of success . #% We are supposed to represent the interests of the people within the European Union , not simply political blocs trying to score points . #% His biographer has said in regard to the Euratom Treaty that he thought that nuclear power had a great future and no past , and neither assertion was true . #% Apparently , you did not consult that committee , you went immediately to the WHO and you are still quoting what it considers to be desirable levels . #% If violence can be ended in the Middle East and the conditions for the reopening of negotiations can be secured , we can once again come to a situation whereby bottom-line issues can be discussed . #% So we must look to the opportunities and take them , and not the negatives . #% As regards the workings of the Convention , I very much welcome the suggestions that have been made here today . #% It is understandable that Palestinians feel that right would have been on their side in formerly declaring an independent Palestinian state on 13 September . #% I agree with you , Commissioner Lamy , that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success . #% I want a single market in services , but I will not accept the ` country of origin ' principle , which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside Europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world . #% Róisín McAliskey is the daughter of a former Westminster MP and this treatment of her is against all principles of human rights in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament . #% Despite its limitations it has stood the test of time . #% Combined heat and power is another very sensible measure which needs encouragement ; as do education and information throughout the EU , particularly to the target groups . #% We have an entirely different responsibility . #% At the same time I would point out that in doing this we have to take special account of the concerns of developing countries , which might not be able to meet the requirements in the same timescale . #% These are all problems that Europe has to solve in partnership , not only between the Commission and Parliament but also between the Commission , Parliament , the Member State Governments and the Member State parliaments . #% For example , the leader of our own government in Ireland , Mr Ahern , is only a recent convert to the duty-free cause . #% The budget will have to be increased significantly if the existing common policies are to continue to operate effectively in an enlarged Union . #% It would be useful if the Commission , in its future annual reports , specified what funding has been provided by national , regional and local public bodies and by the private sector , in addition to European funding , with a view to setting up the trans-European transport networks . #% There is no alternative type of tobacco which is not dangerous to health and it is ridiculous to promote the idea that there is . #% Turkey 's membership , even wider enlargement and the Constitution are all part of the same grand design . #% That is something that does not happen very often , but when it happens it is worthy of note ! #% I should also like to pay tribute to the secretariat of the Development Committee and to the secretariats of those groups that worked constructively with us in these negotiations . #% We are disappointed that Parliament 's proposals were not accepted in their entirety and that the Council decided to weaken the programme in the areas of equality , migrant rights and , crucially , in relation to the budget . #% No one , I repeat , wants to encourage fraud ; certainly we in this Parliament would not in any way want to encourage fraudulent acts and where they are found they must be dealt with very severely . #% Mr President , I wish to compliment those who are still here after this long debate , in particular Mr Dini and Mr Santer . #% 
I would urge Commissioner Byrne to prioritise introduction of that level of consistency which is the only way that we can convince our consumers that we have a common policy in relation to ensuring public health . #% I also welcome the public service character of Eurocontrol . #% Having said that , I should like to make one request . #% I believe that the citizens of Europe are demanding to know the exact responsibilities of the new political portfolios that are being created within the European Union . #% Call it a for a new Europe , but not a for a new Europe . #% The last point I want to make is that , arising from these pressures , we will have a reaction from agriculture . #% I have time only to refer to abuses of religious freedom . #% The most recent survey carried out in May by the Irish Euro Changeover Board show that in my country , 95 % of people know the name of the single currency , 91 % have same prices in both Irish Pounds and the euro and 79 % know that euro notes and coins will be introduced in 2002 . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the proposals before us today , which are clearly designed to tackle delays caused by air traffic control problems in Europe . #% Mr President , it is ten years since I was in Beijing representing the Irish Government as a Minister of State and I am happy to be here today to reaffirm the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action . #% Today there are more than 100 000 chemical products on the European market , a large majority of which have never been evaluated with regard to their long-term effects . #% The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost . #% But there are now welcome indications that the industry has taken on board Parliament 's concern in this regard . #% Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers . #% How can you call in effect for a realignment of taxes in the Member States while such a move is opposed by your own government ? #% Neither the age of a plant nor its location , nor indeed the state-of-the-art design are any guarantee of Y2K date compliance . #% These amendments have already been approved by the JURI and FEMM Committees . #% This will allow passengers , as consumers , to exercise the choice perhaps not to drink alcohol , perhaps to take aspirin three or four days before flying or to wear these new compression socks which help regulate blood flow in the legs . #% Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment when we need sugar production more than ever ? #% Yesterday I voted against the joint resolution on the findings of this special Committee of Inquiry on BSE because I do not believe that any British minister is answerable in law to this Parliament or any of its committees . #% I should like to ask you to put the ratification of Kyoto , which is essential for progress and for all our futures , way up there at the top of the agenda at the EU-Russia summit . #% The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers . #% That is irrational behaviour . #% We must be able to offer industry and SMEs a better deal to ensure that the protection of intellectual property is genuinely an opportunity to create and encourage innovation . #% We must see and analyse the effects of this directive . #% But in the interim this should not be used as a reason for taking our foot off the accelerator on this important issue . #% The European Parliament has always made clear that it wants the European Union to be serious about the issue of nuclear disarmament and this particular initiative is one further step on the path to global nuclear disarmament . #% We ought to focus more on improving the quality of the proposals that we put forward , ensuring that they respond to the demands and needs of the peoples of Europe , and more importantly , ensure that they lay down a solid foundation for the future development of economic prosperity , of stability and of sustainability . #% In particular , we must think of the women and children , whose suffering is not something that has occurred just because of the Hamas takeover in Gaza , or just because of a lack of negotiation between the Palestinian and the Israeli authorities , or just because of the cancellation of aid from the European Union and the US ; their suffering goes back 30 years . #% The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law . #% Judging from the keen interest in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , Members are aware that in our very midst people with mental illness are being subjected to the inhuman abuses of involuntary institutionalisation and hospitalisation , compulsory drugging and other medical treatments , physical restraint and force , while also being subject to discrimination in the workplace , exclusion in the community and suspicion on the part of public services . #% I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis ' approach . #% The carbon footprint left behind by this form of global trading is colossal . #% It has also been reported that there have been violent protests by peasant farmers in the Thai Binh province . #% However , this macroeconomic average disguises large price increases in a long list of everyday items such as coffee , vegetables , bread , hairdressing and parking meters , largely due to opportunistic marking up or rounding-off during the changeover period . #% I have run out of time without saying what I wanted to say but I wanted to respond to some of the points already made . #% the vague use of the term ` radicalisation ' as an indicator for ` non-democratic actions ' ; #% There are clearly concerns in Ireland , especially in those towns hosting these particular athletes . #% Mr President , yet again we are discussing the issue of terrorism in the context of the appalling atrocity in Bali in which hundreds of people lost their lives . #% Recommending that the legal basis be changed to 100a ensures that the codecision procedure will be followed in full . #% However , I urge the Commission to bring to fruition the compensation package promised to beef producers . #% We do have a clear and consistent voice when it comes to environmental matters , and the environmental considerations of energy generation are self-evident and considerable . #% Ireland neither produces nuclear waste nor reprocesses it . #% I congratulate you on the progress you are making to date . #% Mr Bowis has told us about the Scottish example . #% The mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan has been extended so that the UN now has three more months in which to reach an agreement with the Sudanese Government on the need for a more effective multilateral force to protect civilians . #% Since then the European beef industry has been brought to its knees . #% It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it . #% We finally have synchronised guidelines and we need to do the best we can , faced with the situation we now have . #% Indeed , I am delighted to hear that he sees Europol 's role as being central to the development of the fight against organised crime on a pan-European level . #% Mr President , I had great pleasure in voting for this particular report , because the report confirms that food security is a basic human right . #% It is unacceptable that we should be investing in tourism in a situation where gross human rights violations are taking place , where people ' s lives and liberty have basically been denied . #% I have nothing in principle against the implementation of voluntary codes of practice for European Union airlines . #% Irish industry is currently paying a levy to Repak to meet commitments that are not being met . #% One of the things that the sites constantly emphasise is education - the education of young people . #% Some of the landfill sites that are being closed down pose major problems , so it is essential that these sites also come under the directive . #% Please take that as a given . #% I am pleased at the progress which was made in building dialogue at the sixth India-EU summit last year . #% The same thing happened four years ago , which is why I protested in committee . #% Following on from Mr Macartney 's point , in Killybegs in the north-west of Ireland when people complain about the common fisheries policy - and I try to defend the Community - I am told the Norwegians are surviving all right . #% The challenges for us today are to ensure that we can create a proper structure for Europe in the 21st century . #% Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans can not discard the social and economic consequences which they may have . #% It will return a dividend . #% All our Member States must cooperate fully to minimise the risks for all our citizens . #% I urge the President-in-Office of the Council to utilise what are obviously the good offices of the Spanish presidency to bring about that solution . #% One of the exhibits informed me that there are 28 different soil groups all over Europe and six of these soil groups are present in Ireland . #% 
It allows us to be much more efficient in carrying out our EU objectives and policies on climate change , agriculture , security and development in the developing countries . #% I want to know whether there are any possible public health consequences from the use of depleted uranium shells in the location to which I have referred to today . #% Yesterday an article was written by Jim Cusack in . #% The understandable desire of childless couples to have children must not override the human dignity and health of the donors being exploited . #% Mrs Roth-Behrendt did not keep to the subject . #% Everyone should respect international covenants on human rights and each Member State in the European Union has serious questions to answer as regards the application of law . #% Worryingly , the aspect of the struggle to combat terrorism that we are losing is the battle to win public support -- the hearts and minds of large populations in the Arab world in particular . #% The proposed regulation would then focus on the remaining statutory applications . #% However , I am aware , Commissioner , that the vast majority of Member States are of the opinion that the classification of countries for SRM removal purposes should be based on an internationally recognised code set out and agreed by the EU and the many - over 150 third countries - under the auspices of the OIE , the World Organisation of Animal Health , which is based in Paris . #% There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq . #% Member States have an explicit right to put stringent public health rules in place , including a total exclusion of cloned human material or human animal hybrids , as transplantable material . #% I voted against Amendments 31 and 37 as the wording would be interpreted to also include a ban on therapeutic cloning , which I support under proper ethical conditions . #% The conditions in the prisons have to be addressed ; also access of prisoners to basic human rights , access of NGOs to Indonesia , freedom of the press , freedom of movement of people , and the right of people to live in a society where they are not persecuted by their own government . #% We have both retreated to hurling insults at each other across the Atlantic . #% While these measures were not popular before the eruption last week , we are currently at the point where any missed opportunity to provide assistance to the aviation industry could prove to be fatal . #% We must take steps to ensure that labelling does not result in a renationalisation of the food sector . #% I wish it to be recorded here that our vote was intended to support the principle of habeas corpus . #% These are such major infrastructural works that they require massive amounts of people to be employed which gives a kick-start to many economies . #% Only now , after almost 20 years of use , have we realised the permanent damage Ritalin has done to the development of the cardiovascular system of the young adult the child user becomes . #% In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures . #% It is essential that this legislation makes it mandatory for local authorities and the authorities of the Member States to adhere to a minimum distance . #% The issue will certainly continue to be debated over the next year . #% It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in Ireland , cross-border level . #% When the President of the Vietnamese Committee on Human Rights addressed Parliament in December , he described Vietnam as a prison for its people , governed by a red mafia financed by the European taxpayer . #% We have different regional experiences ; we have different needs and capacities ; we have different sectors in terms of technological development and the weight of that development by sector ; and the current report , in terms of what is sets out as a future scenario and development of thinking , allows for a reflection on diversity and building on that diversity . #% In addition to imposing meaningless uniformity , both proposals would have imposed immense cost on UK bread-makers and milk processors , because of the re-tooling which would have been required . #% No matter how you try and come up with solutions to deal with the problems that are there , the one thing we should learn from the practical experience we now have of a number of these various social models is that one size does not fit all . #% The prize is much more than peace in the Middle East : it is world peace , because continued violence in the Middle East is a poisonous backcloth to a lot of the terrorism which continues to happen in all parts of the world . #% We have also been the losers of important projects and significant job numbers . #% In my opinion , this is questioning the credibility of the large number of Members of this Parliament who felt it necessary to go to Iraq because Parliament itself would not send an official delegation . #% In the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference Commissioner Mandelson made significant concessions on European agriculture in exchange for , I suppose , the hope of concessions in non-agricultural market access from the other big economic powers but , as we know , they did not concede much . #% The adult handicapped sector has plans for reform but there are no substantial initiatives as yet , again reflecting the recent interest we have taken in this in the EU . #% As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity . #% Mr President , the terrorist attack in Madrid was an attack on all of us who believe in democracy . #% It further stresses that respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law by all parties and under all circumstances is an essential precondition for achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East . #% Mr President , I agree with all speakers here today who have said that there is no argument for paramilitary justice . #% The report commissioned for the June conference warned that the international financial system has become a money launderer 's dream , processing a large part of the estimated $ 200 billion worth of drugs money every year . #% The EU Enforcement Group , which has been set up under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 338/97 , needs to be revisited somewhat urgently . #% The year 2015 is a political date , not a scientific one . #% The European Parliament should use this debate to make a statement and to send a message to mainland China , saying where the European Union stands . #% Since the 1980s Ireland has advocated a policy of de-institutionalisation , aiming to develop a modern mental health service via a community-based system , promoting mental health , giving the mentally ill as independent a life as possible and providing comprehensive healthcare , moving away from psychiatric hospitals . #% I should like to ask him , in relation to competitiveness and economic capacity -- aspects of the Lisbon Agenda -- if he would confirm that he shares my view that structural labour problems need to be addressed , especially when Europe is compared to the United States ? #% The first is in relation to Mr Stevenson 's attack on a Belgian minister who is not here to defend herself . #% The core goal of a reformed CFP must be to ensure that fishermen can earn a decent livelihood while also achieving environmental sustainability . #% I share his view that the space industry must ` boldly go along the path towards a concentration which will enable it to compete with American manufacturers . ' #% That is , of course , not necessarily true . #% I welcome -- as most people do -- the recent initiative by the G8 to implement further the process of debt relief for the Third World . #% The Commission has made several proposals for programmes - Thermie II , Synergy , Save II - which were , however , not accepted by the Council or provided with adequate funding . #% Can we remind perhaps the Commission and Council that we are co-legislators , not co-drafters of declarations which have no legal force and rely on the Commission 's goodwill to deliver on must-carry . #% Funding will also be provided for conferences and seminars so as to promote educational and student mobility between the European Union and colleges around the world . #% This model effectively separates ownership interests from planning decisions , which helps overall efficiency . #% A false impression is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to the EU markets . #% However , it must also be acknowledged that the harsh Russian winter is not far away and we must therefore prepare for it . #% This State aid was approved by the European Commission . #% This is a straightforward and logical way of dealing with terrorism and those who genuinely want to solve the problem should have no difficulty in following that path . #% But I would have liked to have seen the Council move a lot closer to Parliament 's figure of EUR 2,500 million . #% Mr President , we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people . #% I think one is needed in the near future indicating how we could achieve more harmonisation - of course not at the lowest standards in existence but at the most stringent . #% Another positive development is Edmond Ho Hau-Wah 's stated intention of breaking up the casino monopoly and aiming to create an Asian equivalent of Atlantic City . #% We must ensure that consumers ' rights are protected as these technologies continue . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , can I also say I am not totally convinced by what the Commissioner told us today . #% What is more , not even the Brazilian people will profit from the mining resources which will be sent out of the country to the industrialized countries . #% Irrespective of harmonisation , this idea of mutual respect , trust and understanding between the judicial authorities is the first step towards creating a wider and more inclusive area of judicial operation . #% Five years is far too short a period . #% According to the mid-term evaluation on the spending of the Structural Funds in Ireland , carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute , over 30 , 000 jobs will be created in Ireland in the tourism sector between 1994 and 1999 . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Costa Neves for his efforts on behalf of all of us in this procedure and to say that it is a very technical and difficult task he took on : he has discharged it with great skill and shown much patience and kindness to all of us who wanted our ideas taken into consideration . #% 
I certainly hope this study and the proposals that come forward will , in conjunction with the fishermen , help the fishing industry , the fleet and those who actually work at sea . #% Can he tell us that ? #% If this means waiting for a second-reading agreement , then so be it . #% This has come up over and over again and it is about time action was taken . #% I am therefore in favour of approving the common position on the directive as it is , without further amendments . #% We need to have something at the end that we can be proud of , to allow people to participate in society . #% I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity at least to stretch my thoughts a little bit further than I have ever been allowed to do in this House before . #% To combat drug abuse there must be a partnership approach put in place involving police authorities , social groups , voluntary organisations and local authorities . #% This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm . #% If I might just address those who are calling for Christianity in the Constitution , could I suggest that if God existed she might ask the men who run the churches and the synagogues and the mosques to respect all human rights , and in particular respect the rights of the women they exclude from their ceremonies and from their theologies ! #% The Committee of Inquiry has made an important contribution to the debate and in this regard we must congratulate the rapporteur , the chairman and the members of the committee . #% Those numbers do not take into account the fresh water from melting ice sheets and glaciers , which could at least double the sea-level rise caused by thermal expansion alone . #% The aim of the report is to initiate an action programme in the field of consumer protection for the years 2007 to 2013 . #% For the Council not to do this would add the injury of indifference to the insult of refusing from the outset to provide adequate finance . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by adding my words of welcome to the McCartney family here this evening in our House , and pay tribute to their courage , strength and determination in what they have achieved and in what they have tried to do . #% If you do , you will ultimately face the same fate . #% For the past 25 years I have been a Member of this House , elected at the top of the poll from Northern Ireland . #% Enlargement in the wrong circumstances will certainly halt progress and will probably reverse it . #% I think those of us who participate in the fisheries committee in this parliament do not always get the credit for what they achieve or indeed what the Commission achieves . #% The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies . #% The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome . #% To me it means maintaining a reasonable balance between all sectors , including the profitability of each . #% in writing . - I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) . #% The money is actually transferred and , regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not , the countries become the better off . #% Not one single political party in Ireland argued against enlargement , either on the `` no '' side or the `` yes '' side : only one organisation - a non-party organisation which campaigned for `` no '' - argued against enlargement . #% To this end , I have proposed an oral question to the Commission , to which I hope to get a response at some stage : would it not agree that the arms race is directing resources away from development and the reduction of poverty to the military-industrial complex , and would it not agree that the imposition of sanctions in these circumstances amounts to no more than the punishment of the powerless for the sins of the powerful ? #% Since my time is limited , I want to focus politically just on two issues . #% We call for an immediate and lasting response to our parliamentary resolution . #% Mr President , in discussing this matter I very much welcome the proposal from the Swedish Foreign Ministry that I have just seen today for a goal-oriented action plan for conflict prevention , because as I have said before , we in the European Union should be sending a philosophy for peace to areas of conflict and not just armies . #% It is quite clear from the Treaties that Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament and , despite what the Members over there may try and say and despite what they may try and do , they are flying in the face of law , of constitutional law and of the rights of the people of Europe ! #% The state aid action plan says that we need to maintain a level playing field for all companies active in the single market . #% Shelter for ordinary people can be constructed through a strong common agricultural policy which ensures high-quality food at reasonable prices without negative impacts on the environment . #% I am in favour of cutting costs in relation to the Commission and its agencies . #% I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006 and sincerely hope that further provision will be made in the Financial Perspectives when they are finally established and come into effect in 2007 . #% We can not sweep under the carpet things that we believe and hold true to us , because in this fight , it is absolutely essential that Parliament stands up to this . #% Can the Commission tell us if things have improved in the newly-signed protocol , particularly in relation to the fact that ship owners can opt out simply by paying a small fee , which they would be well capable of doing ? #% There are huge economic implications for Ireland from this disease and while farmers are suffering badly , because of restriction of movements and slaughtering , so are other businesses and industries , particularly our tourism and transport sectors . #% Both are worthy applications . #% I just wanted to emphasize that point . #% The decision was made to move ahead with this urgency on the Western Sahara through the normal and proper channels . #% The best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies , and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society , under which the marvellous resources of that country could be used for the benefit of the entire population . #% However , at the institutional level and on the question of flexibility , we are disappointed that more progress has not been made . #% The partnership principle is fundamental to enhancing the democratic credibility of the funds that we use back in our regions . #% We still have states that welsh on their commitments to reach the development aid target of 0.7 % of GDP , which has been in place for decades . #% I believe that countries with a restrictive policy should relax it , but not on the condition that we tighten our system and restrict the access of our consumers in our countries to vitamin and food supplements . #% Far from being a bail-out , your IMF-EU intervention in Ireland is a mechanism to make the Irish taxpayers vassals to the European banks . #% The essence of the report includes the implementation of the following key provisions : procedures which must be met before a licence can be granted for landfill operations ; the monitoring procedure during landfill sites ' operational phase and closure ; technical conditions to be met by sites and facilities which have to serve as landfill deposits ; classifying the different sets of wastes which can be accepted in landfill sites across Europe and setting targets for the reduction of the amounts of biodegradable municipal waste being deposited in landfills . #% Our government has signed the Aarhus Convention , which makes our government look good among its nation peers , but our government is one of the few signatories that refuse to ratify it and to give it effect . #% I fully support my Socialist Group 's demand that this whole matter be investigated by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry . #% Finally , the CFSP has been one of the European Union 's key successes . #% -- Mr President , I congratulate my colleague on this report . #% I would specifically like an assurance from the President-in-Office that the key decisions will not be taken by the Irish presidency until we in Parliament have been given the chance to offer our own opinions . #% A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators . #% We have heard that case being put here this morning , with Mr Allister of Northern Ireland arguing for a reversion to 19th century absolute sovereignty . #% Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit . #% Politicians do not see any shame in this . #% Commissioner Fischler has quite rightly referred to this problem as the ` scourge of the oceans ' . #% We in Ireland seem to have no say in this . #% It is an ambitious , difficult task . #% Because of the stigma and discrimination , many do not access treatment and help . #% The force majeure provision is also necessary until a liquid trading market emerges . #% Where I have a fundamental problem with this report is in its classification of all addicts as people who are ill rather than criminals . #% Business and retailers must gear up their preparation for this date to ensure that the changeover goes smoothly . #% The key issue now under debate is whether we should have a strict or a relaxed admission policy . #% Most importantly , the only by-products which should end up in animal feed , and consequently the food chain , are those by-products which would be fit for direct human consumption . #% I am sorry that the honourable Member did not pick up what I said on the first occasion but I hope he will now . #% 
Persistent failures at the BNFL Sellafield nuclear facility put at risk the health and wellbeing of those who work there , their surrounding communities and those living on the east coast of Ireland . #% I urge the European Commission to proceed immediately with a legal examination of this law and its implementation and , if necessary , to take action in relation to Hungary to ensure that this law is amended and brought into line with the fundamental values on which the European Union is based . #% If the Commission succeeds in cutting aid to cereal farmers it may later try the same action in other sectors . #% Parliament has certainly devoted considerable time on behalf of its citizens to addressing the important agenda of food safety , while at the same time ensuring that our farmers can operate within a production framework of traceability which is the only way to fully restore consumer confidence in the wide range of quality food products produced by European farmers . #% I do not exclude Parliament from this , I am not a sore loser but I was part of the minority which lost in the postal services liberalisation proposal . #% in writing . - At a time of serious economic and social crisis , we need to increase efforts to coordinate macro-economic and structural reform strategies across national borders so as to tackle the imbalances that hinder the generation of jobs . #% Madam President , it is clear that the real objective here is the removal of the Indonesians from the occupied territory of East Timor and the East Timorese right to self-determination . #% In Britain much of the anti-European rhetoric which has been unleashed following the government 's decision to adopt an obstructionist approach to European decision-making has been profoundly disturbing . #% I am going to put on the record the views of some of those sections of civil society whose voices have not been heard in the preparation of this directive . #% Mr President , on the Northern Ireland Peace II agreement , as you are probably aware , the Council has asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for an extension of this programme for a further two years from 2004 to 2006 . #% The new instrument must be sufficiently funded . #% If the final report of the observation mission concludes that there were serious flaws in the conduct of the election and makes recommendations as to how they can be prevented in the future , the Council and the Commission must act and both must be prepared to use sanctions in the fields of EU trade policy and donor aid to achieve this . #% There can be no doubt that Ireland 's economic success would not have happened , and could not be sustained , outside the framework of EU membership . #% Not for the first time do I want to put on the record that in all of this sorry debacle , farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances which were beyond their control . #% A weighting to reflect the different banking systems may very well be necessary in the fund . #% This situation simply exploits workers , offers no protection , promotes xenophobia , and certainly fits the description of the ` race to the bottom ' . #% The Europe which we are building must favour an inclusive and caring society in which the interests of all must be respected . #% Due to the time constraints , I will leave it at that and not ask the Minister to give me a response in view of Mr Fitzsimons ' interest . #% For my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions . #% I understood , and so did my colleagues from Northern Ireland , that we would have an opportunity to thank you for your welcome to the folks from Northern Ireland and especially the members of the new assembly . #% I fully agree with this political sentiment . #% As Mr Cox has said , we campaigned for enlargement but against the Nice Treaty , because it is not in the interests of the countries coming in , nor is it in the interests of the existing Member States . #% The minutes of this House on Monday 3rd May 2004 exposed Mr Martin for the deceitful person that he is . #% If this regulation is to achieve legal certainty then the requirements must be clear . #% The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states . #% It is a regrettable decision and it is also unjustifiable . #% I would appeal to the Commission to soften the severity of these proposals and find a better way . #% It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing . #% It must deliver a letter , which may originate in the UK or elsewhere , regardless of the cost and regardless of what area of the country it is addressed to . #% Secondly , I wish to place on record that , in respect of the reports which I have heard on the question of the oral submission , I find a number of points within that submission quite disturbing in terms of interpretation of the will of Parliament . #% Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators , they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course . #% I am sure he is aware of the declining age profile of European farmers . #% I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003 . #% Obviously nobody within this House would condone a breach of the regulations or rules . #% A European policy aimed at supporting young farmers and linked to the CAP is essential . #% in writing . - I am supportive of extending the coastal limits from 12 to 20 miles as one of the key reforms of the CFP . #% Many human rights organisations believe that the plan will worsen conditions for poor rural populations and will certainly increase political violence . #% But , even when the profits flooded in , the Lisbon strategy , as our leaders chose to understand it , remained an excuse -- a kind of mantra -- to spend the new and plentiful money on anything but the people who needed it most . #% The extent to which biodiversity impacts on the lives of all citizens and the quality or otherwise of their lives makes this debate extremely important . #% I do not know about you , Commissioner , but that shook me . #% I just want to make it clear to Mrs Schreyer that , as far as I am concerned , if the money goes into the reserve , it is perfectly reasonable for them to be funding things such as HIV and AIDS in the developing world , particularly in Africa . #% Ireland ' s economic success is not solely down to the EU , as many economic experts will tell you . #% We must not forget people with disabilities . #% I am more than a little disappointed with the answer from the President-in-Office , but it may well be outside the competence of the EU as he has said . #% We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under . #% One of the key negotiating chapters remaining open relates to agriculture . #% I thank you and your staff for your help and consideration and for the speedy representation you made to both the Council and the Commission . #% We need more secure systems if we are to boost consumer confidence in using the Internet . #% I thank him for according our institution that respect . #% As to Member States leaving the Commission to do the dirty work , I hope that does not refer to the work of enlargement . #% I hope that during this autumn , under the Belgian Presidency , we will see both of those draft directives adopted . #% But we do not take the final step , which is to create the means to prosecute people who we have found guilty of violating our laws . #% But we , in the Liberal Group , think there can be no more graphic way of confirming this in substance than by his remaining in office to ensure a smooth transition from the first appointee as vicepresident to that person 's successor in office . #% I would support any moves to stamp out this disgraceful trade . #% I should like to refer to what my friend Mr Casaca said about the appropriation by the European Union of the fish of Greenland . #% We would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and can not deal with . #% Madam President , I wanted to bring up the issue of a very important meeting which took place yesterday with Justice and Home Affairs ministers , where agreement was made in relation to people ' s privacy and their right to privacy , their fundamental rights in access to telecommunications . #% Under the Amsterdam Treaty , Parliament has the power of codecision with the Council in the area of consumer protection and public health matters . #% We can not give a signal from this house that we are not concerned with fundamental economic dynamics in the European Union . #% During our two hours on board , it was clear to us that neither the Belgian health authorities nor the airline concerned , British Midland , had the faintest idea what to do in such an eventuality . #% As regards extending working life I would like to say to both Commissioners that many workers are concerned that they will not end up with lifelong learning , but rather with lifelong working . #% The provision of staging posts , therefore , is a central requirement . #% This system has served Europe well and can , if correctly used , eradicate BSE completely from the British herd . #% She is the first President-in-Office I have heard say there will inevitably be job losses because of this decision . #% This is a relatively new area for EU legislation . #% It contained many difficult dossiers and many difficult ideas which many people in industry , in particular , were opposed to but also , uniquely , which a lot of people involved in trade unions were against as well . #% 
Member States must be obliged to communicate new legislation to citizens once it is agreed . #% This is a wise approach by the Committee on Agriculture . #% I would specifically like to draw Members ' attention to the question of whether we elect the President of the Commission or whether we approve the nomination of the President of the Commission . #% But I think we need to re-examine the effect these changes have made in the industry . #% I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force . #% Intellectual property rights will have to be put to one side so that we can alleviate the suffering of millions of people who will die needlessly , if we do not find an urgent solution to this issue . #% Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever . #% Mr President , the momentum building behind green energy , combined with the pressure on traditional agriculture , unite to offer agricultural production for non-food purposes as an alternative for some , as they consider necessary diversification . #% The proposals , as they stand , would result in income reductions for Irish farmers , destabilize the structure of family farms , dissuade young people from taking up farming as a profession and would lead to continued rural depopulation . #% But facts from impact assessment analysis , consumer surveys and so on remain hard to find . #% So the life of these communities rests in a proper appraisal of their needs and their voice needs to be heard . #% As I said , this is an example of a concrete measure we are taking to improve Europe 's environment for entrepreneurs and for investing in our future . #% Our GDP per capita has increased from 64 % of the EU average in 1983 to 87 % last year . #% Although some of the ingredients might have to be imported , that can be done legitimately and they are then put to illegal use . #% It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues . #% The Commission should draw up an accession partnership and provide for a programme of financial assistance for the pre-accession period to help the Maltese authorities to bridge the economic gap that remains between Malta and the European Union . #% Until or unless another referendum is passed , this remains the legal position . #% It is , in my view , a renationalisation of agriculture policy by the back door . #% The Commissioner is living very dangerously and some would say recklessly in the timing of his proposals . #% But all those children who have died are not . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people , and secondly , in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in its attempt to create uncertainty and instability , not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States . #% All these new measures create extra costs , at a time when we have reduced fishing and have a fleet that is , to some extent , in financial difficulty . #% What official business could be more important than this debate this morning ? #% Madam President , the key aim of the EU 's detergent policy has been to safeguard the single market in these products and , above all , to ensure a high level of environmental and human protection . #% I would also like to acknowledge the great cooperation and support I received from the head of the EU Mission , Mr Ilkka Uusitalo , all the heads of the EU diplomatic mission as well as the government and opposition parties in Sri Lanka and particularly the Elections Commissioner . #% The common position was totally unacceptable from Parliament 's point of view . #% However , there is an urgent need to review the Veterinary Medicines Directive according to the outcome of the task force on the availability of veterinary medicines . #% You can not face both ways at the same time , no matter how hard you try . #% It is incumbent on us , because of the institution that we are part of , because of the moral authority which we have in this Parliament as the democratically -- elected voice of the people , we should stand up and resist all violence against people . #% On the question of principle , no Member of this House surely has so little respect for him or herself that they feel they should not be paid a proper salary at a level common to each and every one of us . #% In Amendment No 19 there is a call for harmonisation of penalties . #% Everything is decided in Dublin at central government level . #% One of the biggest costs confronting small and medium-sized business , where the bulk of today 's jobs are to be found , is the cost of servicing the capital which is being borrowed to fund such things as product development or property and equipment purchases . #% Let us learn some lessons and let us address that critical part of the mandate . #% Mr President , last week we celebrated the first anniversary of the largest enlargement to date of the European Union . #% We must not be competing with each other and we must not be dependent on the United States - or any other country which makes a far lesser effort than we do - to design the policies to which we will contribute . #% That was unfortunate . #% There is a lot of unhappiness here about the Commission declaration . #% Closer cross-border regulation , monitoring and minimum harmonised standards for agents ' contracts would contribute to tackling this problem and are necessary to ensure the integrity of football . #% Firstly , this Parliament has a responsibility to highlight and condemn actions taken by authorities that are a blatant and tragic breach of peoples ' human rights , particularly when these events occur in the EU neighbourhood and with countries that we are working with through cooperation and/or association agreements . #% We live in an internal market with free movement of goods , persons , services and capital . #% Once this principle is established we must go further to refine testing . #% -- Mr President , I am pleased to have this brief opportunity to strongly support this resolution . #% If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms , then the costs of these medicines would be substantially reduced . #% This is a balance which I really welcome . #% They are still in a holding centre with no assurance of being granted asylum and facing the possibility of deportation and death . #% Most financial institutions that lend money are in business to maximise profits . #% They have always been cooperative and competent and they would often have liked to go much further and do much more than they were allowed to do . #% Because there is a degree of complacency with regard to all EU change , every effort must be made in the months remaining before 1 January to alert consumers to the importance of what is happening and , more importantly , to assure them that their interests are placed at the forefront by those whose job it is to manage this important change . #% Firstly , concerning the time in which Member States must report back to the Commission on their experience in implementing the recommendation - the Council can accept our suggested 45 months . #% Finally , it is a forward looking plan when we look at cooperation with the United States of America and other countries throughout the world , to ensure that this new technology can be used for the benefit of all of mankind and not for those who want to avoid our legal structures . #% The public ' s trust in the authorities is important to ensuring adequate responses . #% There is a key role for EUROPOL in the implementation of this report . #% There is no case for breaking these agreements . #% This is something we must be very careful of . #% However , many of Malta 's administrative , legal and fiscal structures have already been aligned to European Union standards . #% However , merely throwing it to Parliament when there is no time available to put a reasoned and responsible viewpoint forward is a bigger insult to Parliament than not consulting it at all . #% So , it is a good resolution . #% In fact , a trinity of events has taken place which has guaranteed that the pace of EU enlargement has accelerated and is now an unstoppable process . #% Firstly , the relatively small risk of a very serious accident with huge implications . #% Members will recall my concern on how our proposals would affect the small aircraft operators and how we could resolve that , as also those involved in leisure flying , be it in gliders , hang-gliders or microlights . #% Madam President , I would like to join the chorus of praise for our Ombudsman . #% Could you elaborate on that please ? #% Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation . #% The rapporteur is to be complimented on her efforts to take on board the experiences of those directly involved and I particularly wish to acknowledge the fact that the views of the Irish agency , Largos , are reflected in the text . #% The objective of the Sharon Government at this point in time is the destruction of any possibility of a Palestinian State . #% 
The third countries simply do not have the resources to ensure that the vessels from the EU and other distant water fleets respect the rules . #% The circumstances of Robert McCartney 's murder shocked very many people . #% Difference is the essence of humanity , and it should therefore be totally respected and never fought over . #% Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel 's compliance with human rights provisions , nothing tangible has been done , to my knowledge . #% The key to the future of a credible Europe lies in a proper relationship between the Commission and Parliament built on mutual respect . #% When influenza successfully infects a new species , it can reassort , and may switch from being an avian to a mammalian one . #% If it were only a question of the exchange rate , then prices should also go down with exchange rate variables . #% We , too , believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism . #% We should also remember that whatever laws or whatever rules we make will apply to an enlarged Community where economic convergence will be much less than what it is today . #% Mr President , I welcome the thrust of this report , which seeks to implement strict rules with regard to the operation of landfill sites within the territories of the Union . #% Behind our trade barriers there is the risk that we will cultivate the seeds of more international conflict . #% She is suspected of a crime in Germany but has not been convicted . #% Such deaths devastate families and tear the heart out of communities . #% We need to send a clear message with this report that , while EU membership is achievable , it will require significant and sustained commitment to reform . #% We have come a long way , over a long number of years , in trying to change the view that nationalism in Ireland has of itself . #% In practice , the obligation to review is one of the most important requirements in the report , and for that I thank the Members . #% The objective of this directive is to ensure that the injured party has a right of action against the insurer of the person who caused the accident . #% Our Government has made clear that it will support a yes vote for the Treaty of Nice , as of course democratically it is allowed to do , but my constituents would like to decide for themselves and would like to have copies of the Treaty itself . #% There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need . #% Laudable as the proposed changes are , in many ways they are merely tinkering around the edges . #% Regrettably , our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs , cigarettes and human beings . #% Finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation . #% The Irish Government and other EU governments must also retain discretion at a national level over the participation in any future military operations . #% At present we have Meryl Streep making a film based on one of our twentieth century playwrights . #% In spite of initiatives taken by the Commission to strengthen its dialogue with the industry , I believe that these should be fully reinforced . #% I salute her for being one of the few genuine revolutionaries in this House since , on this issue , she has never stopped spinning . #% From an ethical point of view , it can no longer be accepted by the EU institutions . #% The renewal of the protocol is now more important than ever in terms of fishing opportunities , after the failure to reach agreement with Morocco . #% What action has the Commission taken to ensure that the public is fully informed with regard to these rules and their rights ? #% I wish that they would take into consideration the international aspects of this in relation to the immense social and environmental problems that will be caused . #% Flexibility , minimum regulation and a belief that farming and rural development are allies , not alternatives are , in my opinion , the way to proceed . #% I share the rapporteur 's view about transparency . #% I was against part two , but was in favour of part one . #% We and others have brought it down to 22 000 because of democracy and human rights and the sort of financial instruments which the Union has approved . #% I should like to ask you to take on board the views of those who know more about children in the developing world than perhaps you or I do , and who are concerned about the fact that we are perceived as a Union that concentrates more on large infrastructural projects than on children , and perhaps to think more deeply about the needs of children in terms of medical care and other assistance . #% There is very little competition in this field . #% If this goal is accomplished , economic growth can re-commence and the recovery process can begin . #% They help keep older people in the communities where they have spent most of their lives , with the support of family , friends and services , and in familiar surroundings . #% The black economy is thriving in Europe in the services sector because these complex and costly barriers are encouraging businesses to engage in undeclared and illegal work . #% in writing . - Cultural and creative industries are not only a source of wealth and employment but also contribute to Europe 's social and cultural fabric . #% The problem now is the lack of clarity regarding state aid for regional airports in Europe . #% In this regard , I wish to say to the Council that my Group deplores the continued failure by the Council to agree a legal base for a financial protocol with Turkey . #% As well as the problems of marine pollution , European citizens are also alarmed that our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs , cigarettes and human beings . #% From numerous media reports , it appears that the Commissioner with responsibility for trade is calling for restraint in this affair and has made a plea to avoid what he calls protectionist thinking . #% It is , however , the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council 's delaying tactics . #% We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society . #% We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents . #% I would like to thank you , Mr President and colleagues , for the moment 's silence for the awful tragedy which took place only this week in my own home county of Wexford in Ireland . #% We can not and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs . #% To not allow public funding for research which is legal in a Member State is a curious sanction : nobody is forcing any Member State to make any type of research legal . #% I am aware of the difficulties , as I said , being expressed by these lecturers , some of whom are from my own country , who have made representations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs , the Minister for Education and myself . #% As to that future , I have no doubt that the industry must be involved in the decision-making process . #% Finally , I would appeal to professional planners to use their common sense by taking account of the views of public representatives and community groups . #% The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable . #% It would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely . #% This is not about harmonisation ; this is more about mutual recognition of 25 varying and different regulations in the Member States to ensure that small companies , small innovators , can be guaranteed legal certainty and financial certainty with regard to the protection of their ideas and the promotion of them . #% Secondly , implementing a coordinated and sustained effort by donor governments gives rise for concern . #% The voice of areas heavily dependent on farming , like Northern Ireland , must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy . #% It has made a real change to real people 's lives in all of the Member States . #% In conclusion , the historical legacy of Irish economic migration throughout the world in the past two centuries , particularly during and after our Irish potato famine of 1845-1849 is one which we as Irish Europeans should not ignore . #% Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field . #% Before I welcome this proposal , I wish to see removed the ambiguity that has arisen in the wake of the remarks made by the British Defence Secretary , Geoffrey Hoon , namely is it a Franco-British force or an EU force ? #% This directive will clarify the reimbursement of costs for treatments that patients have received in another Member State and will ensure the good functioning and the financial balance of national health systems . #% The Ulster Unionist Party has received so much support from this House time and time again , and at the same time , in the European Parliament , we have the Referendum Party propping up a single Member with # 150 , 000 for the general election campaign in Britain . #% The slowness of payments is no longer tolerable in an age when we can boast of nanosecond technology . #% I come from Northern Ireland , part of the United Kingdom , and across the border , in the Republic of Ireland , the waste oil directive is interpreted differently . #% 
The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students . #% I know I indicated that I wished to speak before other colleagues who spoke -- good luck to them . #% However , no barriers can protect us from the forces of globalisation . #% They are storing up resentment and even hatred among the people in the Middle East and the Islamic nations throughout the world . #% Mr President , it is now clear that everyone 's hope that the foot-and-mouth disease crisis will be temporary and short-lived has not been realised . #% It can be taken from you , but the freedom that allows us to have the passions that burn in our hearts and souls must always be preserved and protected . #% Can we do more for them ? #% Finally , the European Parliament has extensive powers of codecision to deal with environmental and public health issues . #% Reversing this situation and developing a smart , social market economy where the EU is a global leader across all fields of economic life will be the measure of this Commission . #% Yet never once did anyone challenge our ongoing assessment . #% in writing . - Today , Parliament voted to block the authorisation of thrombin for use as a food additive . #% But this is a sterile debate and I do not propose to get into it . #% Colleagues , if you want Europe to matter to the people in your constituency , choose subjects which interest them . #% To focus too closely on the negligible quantitative effect of Kyoto , in terms of immediate results of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions , however , is to miss the point . #% Mr President , to illustrate the situation in graphic detail , I can tell you about 600 workers in Ballyfermot in Dublin who were employed in the Semperit Plant , a subsidiary of Continental AG , one of the largest employers in this deprived area of Dublin . #% Mr President , PVC is the second most commonly used plastic . #% I have huge concerns about the possibility for Member States to cut 20 % of market support measures and direct payments and to allocate it to rural development . #% We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO . #% We went up from EUR 385 million in 1996 to a EUR 5 707 million take in 2004 . #% Are you convinced that should Romania accede next year , it will continue on that path towards reform ? #% Not a lot has happened since in one sense . #% In other words , were Member States ' regulators in other countries informed as soon as possible ? #% There is too much criticism of EU regulation and the onus is on us legislators to demonstrate the host of valuable measures that have originated here which improve the status and condition of women . #% The tormented victims of brutal terrorism are largely forgotten . #% I would like that corrected . #% Furthermore , no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women . #% I am pleased that the members of the Greater London Assembly are now equally concerned by the shipment of radioactive nuclear materials in England and , in particular , to the BNFL Sellafield plant in Cumbria . #% ` Deplores the fact that some mainstream parties have seen fit to give credibility and acceptance to extremist parties by entering into coalition agreements , thereby sacrificing their moral integrity for the sake of short-term political gain and expediency . ' #% Finally , while we are debating human rights in the EU for 2005 , I can not let the occasion pass without registering my concern regarding the need for clarity on the so-called CIA rendition flights issue . #% The Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme known as EMAS afforded an opportunity to EU companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations . #% He would have wanted to have been here to witness the mature and responsible way in which this Parliament is building a consensus on behalf of our citizens for the opening of the market on services . #% We need to look at this . #% Our hospitals and our health services are staffed by health workers from India , the Philippines , South Africa and many other countries . #% This must have been very difficult for the rapporteur in face of Members of this Parliament who want to drag their heels for the benefit of the packaging industry . #% . Mr President , once again the eyes of the world are on the Middle East . #% One of these was that the tribunal should have full power to subpoena witnesses and documents , together with all the powers usually exercised by a commissioner in a public enquiry . #% Does he regard the committee whose advice he rejects as incompetent , unable to judge what is good for animals or dangerous for human health ? #% This is largely a neutral proposal by the Commission , but the Committee on Agriculture has its responsibilities to farmers . #% In Ireland at present there are two green rates : the first is for CAP support , such as the payment of export refunds and intervention stocks and has varied substantially over the last eighteen months . #% Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives . #% However , UK fishermen 's experience of the common fisheries policy , whatever the Conservative Party might now say , has been so negative that , in consequence and in conscience , I could not advocate what amounts to the full extension of the common fisheries policy controls to the inshore sector . #% When that occurs , a human epidemic can result . #% Also , from a health perspective , this scheme would protect people from potentially carcinogenic , mutagenic , reprotoxic or biocumulative products which can sometimes be traced in textiles . #% No one has been able to agree on how you work towards their recovery , however . #% I once again pay tribute to the rapporteur . #% While I welcome the current Commission proposals concerning consumer access to justice , I am very disappointed to see that family access to justice , which is a human right , has not yet received the same level of attention . #% If Amendment No 45 does not fall , I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services . #% Establishing safety and confidence when we are faced with cyber-crime is another area which calls for a collective response on a global scale , given the world-wide dimension of the Internet . #% Two high-profile examples from Ireland -- Intel and Ryanair -- have been highly instructive in demonstrating how unreasonably applied competition policy can militate against competition . #% Not too far from here children are still viewed as disposable objects for international adoption , for example . #% The amendments which I tabled to Mr Jarzembowski ' s and Mr Swoboda ' s reports aimed at restoring the equilibrium established by the common position . #% There is something else , however , of vital importance to this Parliament : is this unfair competition now being introduced here ? #% There is an obligation on each and every one of us to support that change . #% The key priorities are : to be effective , to have a fair and equitable distribution , to have affordable policy , because less sometimes can be more , and to have a sustainable cohesion policy that will take us into the new millennium . #% Today we can see that we provide here , in Europe , almost half of the IFI 's annual budget . #% Madam President , I should also like to thank Mrs Fontaine for a very excellent report and also my colleague Mrs Berger who took on board several amendments regarding the architects . #% I would like the Commission to clarify this particular matter this evening . #% I reject this notion and support the concept of voluntary modulation which was agreed by the 15 Member States in Berlin . #% That could have been any ten days in those sorry four years . #% If that means adapting boat engines so that they can run on a high percentage of alternative fuels such as bioethenol then we must take the necessary measures to adapt boat engines accordingly . #% On the positive side , Macau 's economy has progressed significantly since the handover , enjoying a 4 % growth in GDP during the year 2000 . #% They also want these drugs to be regulated . #% However , the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States , which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the cross-border supply of online betting and gambling services . #% I wholeheartedly supported this move and now we can let the market set its own standards . #% The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported . #% Such action would clearly demonstrate the EU 's determination to make real and tangible progress on this all-important issue . #% 
What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable . #% We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya . #% Would the Commissioner not agree that there is considerable discontent amongst the fishermen involved who feel that they have been displaced , not because of any scientifically based conservation programme , but simply for political reasons , to enable their catches to be exploited by others who have a different traditional way of exploiting stocks ? #% But I must say that I am disappointed here today that the Council have already decided and that we are debating a report when a decision has been taken . #% I ask Member States to look seriously at the framework in which we consider it . #% My reason for rising here today is to welcome those participating in the freedom drive to the European Parliament . #% The longer the conflict continues , the more it becomes a source of regional instability . #% Despite its high economic costs , its failure to deal with radioactive waste and the need for very high safety and security standards , ` stupid ' energy would insist on the promulgation of nuclear power , even in countries at very high risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for her very full reply . #% I would therefore encourage Israel , whatever the international pressures , to be resolute and constant in this regard . #% I support this resolution and the proposal for the family to be given full funding for any legal fees it may incur if it goes to trial . #% Prior to the birth of the EEC in 1957 , Europe was bedevilled by hatred and division . #% At a time of acute pressure on our health service and vital education sector , it is appalling that we are wasting so much taxpayers ' money on a failing political union . #% The whole area must be managed by the stakeholders through the regional advisory councils , if not , we will never bridge the deep divide that exists between fishermen and scientists at the moment . #% This plan also proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness , expertise and practice in such areas as appliance purchasing , use of energy in the home , building installations , heating systems and energy management in industry , the services sector and also the public sector . #% Persons involved in perpetrating any of these awful terrorist attacks which have taken place must be arrested and must be brought to justice , including terrorists operating in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad organisations . #% I congratulate Mr Vitorino on the work that has been brought forward , but Tampere set an agenda and I wonder why , so long after Tampere , we are still struggling to define what that agenda should be . #% In view of the world-wide demand for seafood , it is increasingly important as a raw material supplier to the fish processing sector , with a significant added value and export opportunities . #% I look forward to seeing full ratification by all 10 accession countries . #% I thought the Council was going to say again that this is not its responsibility . #% In the UK , the legacy of a Conservative government is an acute shortage of doctors . #% It is necessary that provisions be made to compensate those affected by such designation . #% It is appropriate that we are having this debate as a joint debate with the Casaca report , because the whole issue of fishery control measures and what is required is one that not only can deliver more environmentally and economically sustainable fisheries ; it can also give certainty to many fishing families , so that they can continue to live their lives in the way that they have enjoyed up to now . #% Employees will be protected from predatory funds bent on short-term profiteering through the destruction of viable companies . #% I share these concerns and I urge the Hong Kong SAR Government to address them in the final proposals that they bring forward . #% I think it is symptomatic of the goodwill that has been shown towards the peace process in Northern Ireland . #% The application of global amounts in accordance with commercial practice has also been accepted as have , in a range of other areas , the inclusion of local flights , measures to be taken when aircraft land without adequate insurance cover , and withdrawal of operating licence if the insurance cover is not sufficient . #% This resolution which , incidentally , is supported by the European Parliament and by my own country , Ireland , sets forth a new way of thinking for effective measures to forward the cause of a nuclear-free world . #% Extending such joint surveillance exercises into the applicant countries should be an early objective . #% The common agricultural policy is a uniform European-wide programme . #% Last year it was climate change , and both climate change and biodiversity loss are the two greatest environmental challenges facing us . #% The amendments proposed by Parliament do not concern the substance of the DCI or the other instruments , but the role of Parliament in the practical implementation of the law . #% But we have some questions that arise from the hearings and some observations . #% This scourge must be tackled , and my delegation supports this report which sends a strong message that the European Parliament will not tolerate fraud , evasion or tax havens operating with impunity . #% I would commend this report to the House and ask it to support it . #% It is up to Russia to sort out its own political mess which has directly led to the country 's economic collapse . #% Indeed , the Christian gospels say it is worthy of a millstone around the neck . #% Some say they know the answer , but I have not come to any conclusion . #% What is it saying about the Anglo-French beef issue ? #% We all want to see democracy restored in Pakistan . #% Criminal sanctions should be used against those responsible for the environmental pollution caused by deliberate dumping and by maritime disasters . #% We want to see it better resourced , both in the Commission and at Member State level , and we want to see SOLVIT as a trouble-shooter for citizens and consumers throughout the EU . #% We should be doing our best to get more finances to deal with this problem . #% Therefore , it is all right to supply heroin to children or to adults , as long as you do not want to make a profit from it . #% I wish the record to be changed , if possible . #% The aim of the proposal is to add a further , simpler , method of spending the European Social Fund , so that its contribution to addressing the economic and social challenges facing Europe during the crisis can be faster and more effective . #% It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies . #% The aim is truth in advertising . #% One of the most important aspects of this directive is that it will restore confidence in blood transfusion services generally and in the movement of blood and blood products throughout the European Union so we can all have confidence in other Member State systems in relation to it . #% Labelling is a clear and simple measure to promote energy efficiency , ethical production and development of greener technologies . #% As more and more Members come into the Chamber , I would like to announce a welcome innovation . #% Mr President , I very much regret that this will be my last speech to this Parliament , having been here for the past 25 years . #% We are somewhat sceptical about the degree to which this should be autonomous of transatlantic relations . #% Despite warning letters , reasoned opinions , threats of legal action to the European Court of Justice , so it embarrassingly continues . #% The practical ramifications and consequences of EMU for the consumer must be closely analysed and monitored . #% That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do . #% What are you going to do about it ? #% But we have said very clearly that free movement of goods must not compromise safety . #% On 4 March 2002 , our environment minister introduced a plastic bag tax in Ireland , 15 % per bag . #% For example , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against in many European countries because of their sexual orientation . #% It is in this year 's guidelines ; it was in last year 's guidelines ; it was in the guidelines the year before and it was in the Delors White Paper . #% Downstream users of chemicals , which include the vast majority of SMEs , will benefit significantly from this information . #% The way to do that is to transport the philosophy of the European Union to areas of conflict : dialogue developed there will enable agreement to be reached accordingly . #% Firstly , conditions do not change at all for the animals . #% The Nitrates Directive is certainly not doing this with 12 of the 15 Member States being taken to court over wrong or inadequate implementation . #% It is vital , as Mrs Wallis , has said , that the consumer is aware and informed of this option . #% 
That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything . #% This is the question - both parliamentary and political - but for a different reason , to the President of the Socialist Group . #% What do you mean by that ? #% I would criticise Mrs Harney for so doing , if , as was said , she did that at a time in the process when consultations should have been taking place . #% Thus there is a solid scientific basis for the proposed limit values . #% Just imagine the possibilities : citizens from Latvia , Spain , Ireland or Sweden , for example , finding common cause and demanding action . #% Mr President , Commissioner , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , like others , I wear a badge which symbolises trade with justice . #% I regret that there has been no consideration of establishing a new programme to combat social exclusion and actions on behalf of the elderly . #% We support the position of the World Medical Association , the Committee of European Physicians , in opposing the patenting of human genes without any exception . ' #% Even though you talk about the justification for this , you do not mention what the consequences are or the cost effect for the Internet providers to provide such a facility . #% I also object to the deals which have been struck at the last minute behind closed doors resulting in a compromise package which seriously weakens the provisions for must-carry services and for people with special needs and disabilities . #% This anger was fuelled by the massive disappointment at what was perceived to be the intimidation of the minority with the participation of the police force and the British Army in that exercise . #% The dangers associated with incineration in the past have generally been overcome as a result of technological progress . #% It is believed that something rather nasty may have died in the works - a large rat or even a small mouse - but we hope that by this afternoon it will have been cleared up . #% Environmental scaremongering hampers open debate by inflating a stateable risk , for example the presence of a toxin , so that it becomes an inaccurately perceived threat , for example by failing to acknowledge that the quantity of the toxin falls significantly below any threatening dose . #% I have two other points . #% This issue is going to go on and on . #% This regulation , I am sure , will be welcomed by those who have an interest in the proposed incinerator in Ringsend in Dublin and will have certainly greatly facilitated those with concerns about Corrib Gas in the west of Ireland . #% I can only say that I wish that Commissioner Byrne 's colleague , Mr Fischler , would demonstrate the same willingness to understand the difficulties currently faced by European farmers . #% Because of the way the world is changing , globalisation is unstoppable unless , of course , we erect iron curtains or bamboo curtains , and those too would be blown away by the winds of change . #% Streamlining VAT procedures for these businesses will enhance efficiency and encourage increased activity within the internal market , feeding to the Lisbon Agenda , which is supposed to be the focus and aim for all of us at the moment . #% Important socioeconomic benefits of the programme will also be lost . #% The two must go hand-in-hand . #% This is excellent work done by this Parliament . #% The Greek Government has supported recent peace efforts in the Middle East . #% It is believed that this is the work of British paedophiles who have fled their native country . #% I share the view of the rapporteur that what is needed are concrete proposals for firm action . #% The free movement of safe and wholesome food and feed is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and wellbeing of citizens and their social and economic interests . #% With these few comments , I commend the rapporteur 's efforts and I very much welcome the report he has produced . #% Those are the matters which really concern the fishermen of Northern Ireland . #% While beef producers need all the support they are getting , given their present difficulties , it is not in their interest either to have competition generated between dry stock sectors by imbalance in the respective regimes . #% It is clear that injury places a heavy burden on the economy . #% I would just like clarification as to when the Commissioner believes the conciliation process on the junior doctors will commence . #% The European Union delegation was given a kick in the face by the Israelis by not being allowed to meet with the necessary parties to try to start a dialogue and bring it around . #% Perhaps you can not prevent what has happened , but you can ensure that it does not happen again and that this will not be a signal to other Member States to follow suit , because freedom of the press is an extremely important aspect of democracy . #% Therefore , the price in Ireland can often be very different from that in the rest of the European Union . #% I hope we can see those elections held very soon . #% I oppose the motion . #% Animals can be , and are being , transported with full respect for their welfare . #% There is no doubt in my mind that we will soon be asked to approve further funding . #% In this regard the Irish Government and authorities are not at fault . #% As far as my own personal position is concerned , I have voted in accordance with my own conscience , which is that I am opposed to abortion . #% I think the Commissioner is doing a very good job in what is an extremely difficult situation . #% We had beef mountains , we had butter mountains , we had milk lakes and we had cereal mountains . #% The British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence , trial by one 's peers , as in the Magna Carta . #% Mr President , as a politician representing a very rural constituency highly dependent on agriculture , I want to say that the outcome of the Berlin Summit of Agenda 2000 was not as disappointing to myself or my constituency as we first thought . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , on his report . #% author . - Madam President , I , too , want to commend to Members the excellent work that has been carried out by our rapporteurs for the goods package , Mr Brie , Ms Schaldemose and Mr Stubb , who , I think , are all legislative virgins . #% We need to look at the location of water and how infrastructures could be used . #% I was prevented myself from going there . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her response , even though it was very short and curt . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Belder , and indeed the European Commission , for producing the interesting 2001 report . #% How can the Commission help the social partners , the employers and the trade unions to get on board and run model action programmes ? #% There is nothing whatsoever in this storm in a teacup that is trying to be wrapped up by the Social Democrats against Commissioner McCreevy . #% How can people take seriously the idea the EU is promoting a social Europe when this proposal drives yet another nail in its coffin ? #% In my own country of Ireland a total of EUR 125 million has been devoted to developing an environmentally sustainable energy sector . #% I think we should reinstate this budget line . #% But we are in danger of overplaying our hand . #% Despite a short six months in which to work , Ireland sponsored positive initiatives like the ` Communicating Europe ' initiative . #% Commissioner and President-in-Office , now is the time to be brave . #% Finally , does he agree that rural development policy will not achieve its full potential in isolation from integrated regional policy ? #% But we must ask why the regime of Mr Aliyev is implementing such horrific repression . #% If this discrimination continues then ICBAN funds must be frozen until there is total fairness . #% In that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour . #% I ask the Prime Minister to clarify , in the light of the agreement at Helsinki , that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis . #% Let us sit down , come to the Fisheries Committee , listen to the officials , listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility . #% 
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , the proposed law to ban what is called the public promotion of gay relations in Lithuania is another excuse to crush the rights of gay , lesbian , transgender and bisexual people in that state . #% Most people here will be aware of the increasing criticism , both nationally and internationally . #% However , there is a need to review the criteria for qualifying for this aid . #% If it is not accurately reported , then you should immediately correct it . #% Most important of all , are we to see nothing but white elephants as our contribution to the Middle East peace process ? #% Before the end of this decade , instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding , we will become a net contributor to the EU budget . #% ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit . #% This issue is one of major international concern , but I know that it could not be in better hands that those of the Commissioner . #% author . - Madam President , I would like to apologise , because it is not normal that I do not turn up when I am supposed to speak . #% The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50 % , the further the money goes and the greater the impact . #% The country is in crisis : there are a huge number people that are food dependent ; law and order has broken down ; people in Iraq are saying that now that they come out on the streets people are dead ; the whole structure has broken down . #% In particular , there are two areas on which I thought you might have responded . #% Madam President , I recently visited North Korea with Trocaire , an Irish catholic agency , courtesy of my ECU allowance . #% The most important and crucial issue is that Parliament voted quite clearly for a maximum overall journey time for slaughter , which was also reflected in the declaration signed by over 400 Members of this House . #% Here , in the European Union we have the problem of decommissioning our nuclear facilities at our Joint Research Centre . #% The natural effect regions will see some hope in the reply you have just given . #% The fact that the European Union is the world 's principal donor of humanitarian aid , is neither known nor understood by many of our citizens . #% The proposed ban would apply only to products tested in the EU and would allow companies to export testing to other parts of the world . #% Does the Commissioner not accept that the Community interest is not served , nor is the competitiveness of the EU textile industry served , by the imposition of such duties ? #% Would the President 's office undertake a review of the 25 Member States to see which arrangements are in place allowing these European citizens to vote in states which are not their own ? #% I too am concerned about diluting and weakening the European Union through too quick enlargement , although I am encouraged by progress towards monetary union . . #% Under no circumstances , having secured additional commitments from the Council and recognizing the critical importance of the Stability and Growth Pact to EMU , will my group be prepared to postpone the vote tomorrow . #% We must all face up to this fact and facilitate this process as much as possible . #% In banning some of the objects the Commission recognises that these substances are dangerous . #% Mr President , I rise on the same issue . #% We always respond several months too late , we spend hours debating crises in this House and in other institutions , but we are not there , when it counts , as quickly as we should be . #% Software is not an invention and is already protected under copyright law , just like books , films and music . #% Madam President , the Commissioner finished his speech by saying that not that many consequences can be drawn from this case . #% Even though the proposed budget for the programme is lamentable - ECU 28 million over five years is entirely inadequate given the scale of the problem - it is evidence of the recognition of the need for concerted action at European level . #% This approach should also be continued . #% When farmers are suffering because of bad deals made by Peter Mandelson at the WTO talks , or when agriculture is under threat , then we need to invest in renewable energy . #% It is three years since the Delors White Paper and still all we have are words and not deeds . #% This principle in essence means that safety and health must be put before any conflicting scientific evidence , and I fully support the previous speakers who again referred to the importance of applying the precautionary principle . #% We must do what we can to make the Internet safer . #% Targeting him by kidnapping him is not only an appalling crime in itself , but it is self-defeating in terms of the Palestinian people 's cause . #% It will not be in the interests of people , despite what you are trying to say here . #% I support wholeheartedly the report of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz ; except that I do not agree with her omission of domestic waste and will vote against it . #% We have invasive alien species here , over 40 % of the EU 's species -- both flora and fauna -- are under threat , and yet we have no debate on this issue during a designated Green Week . #% I wish to assure the honourable Member that I shall use any opportunity I have to raise this issue . #% Members of the European Parliament , quite correctly , are harsh in their condemnation of the crushing of the right to dissent and to demonstrate freely in Azerbaijan , and I can not let this opportunity pass to also condemn the disgraceful repression of protests by the Danish police in Copenhagen in recent days , who arrested up to 1 000 entirely peaceful protestors , handcuffed them and left them lying for hours in the cold . #% In one of the slums there I visited a school which has 1 690 students and 22 teachers . #% That is why Labour Euro MPs voted against calls for a 5 % budget increase . #% It is not just our 25 votes , but the other votes that we will attract from among the 166 parties voting on these issues . #% At present there are 73 air traffic control centres in the pan-European airspace , which all operate under different codes of classification . #% Here I call on the Commissioner to target fleets which impose unsustainable pressure on key stocks . #% In the late 1980s and early 1990s a voluntary group called the Chernobyl Children 's Project was set up in Ireland by one woman who saw the horrors of Chernobyl . #% There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation . #% President Santer has accepted reforms proposed by the leader of the EPLP , Alan Donnelly . #% I ask you for your support for my amendments in plenary . #% At the dawn of the 21st century , we should send a message to the world that the EU recognises the ability in all , the right to equal treatment and equal access to opportunity . #% Unfortunately , what has been forgotten in the debate , discussion and media coverage , is that there were also many peaceful protests , where Muslims and non-Muslims came together because they found the cartoons and the images they represented offensive , not to their religious belief , but to them as human beings . #% To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong . #% Surely it was to these farmers that schemes such as the retirement scheme were in the first instance directed . #% It is often forgotten that packaging waste is only a small proportion of total landfill . #% The impact of this directive will not be uniform across all sectors of the economy and therefore it will negatively impact on certain sectors , in particular those areas that are more heavily dependent on transport . #% Is this a wise move ? #% We want to make both these key projects a real success within the Union , and we support enlargement . #% When we vote tomorrow , the EUR 14.8 million will represent a hand-up and not a hand-out to over 2 400 people to help them restart their lives . #% Although it is a very toxic substance , the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria . #% Measures must be implemented to raise more from this sector and contribute to shifting the burden of taxation away from working people . #% I met with a disability group when I was there last year , and everything pointed to the fact that people with disabilities like Down 's Syndrome are simply eliminated before or after birth . #% We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since ? #% There is a serious matter . #% There are many other points including an almost unrestricted Patenting system that force me to vote against this report . #% The Western military/industrial complex had a field day and poured its weapons into Baghdad . #% I passed it on Saturday evening and noticed an already impressive stack of refrigerators that had accumulated in less than ten weeks . #% 
Although this document is far from perfect it is going in the right direction . #% It is quite interesting when you look at the figures , which show that 70 % of the workforce that will be employed in the year 2010 is already at work , but only 20 % of the technology which will be used in that year is available at the present time . #% It matters in any field and , in this case , if public health , by reason of its scale or effects , can be better achieved through the cooperation of Member States , then this should be encouraged . #% Quite truthfully , a lot of what Mr Titford said resonated very strongly with me . #% So I would ask the Romanian authorities to look at that again . #% - I welcome the adoption of this report on the basis that it ensures the right to a higher level of public health protection and could potentially pave the way for the eventual eradication of tobacco addiction within the EU in the long term . #% We must not take from poorer countries in destructive and disabling ways . #% In some other experiences I have had with the Commission 's external offices I sometimes felt that they can get too close to the local political administration and are somewhat reluctant to take a strong stance on policy and political issues . #% While it is important for us to be prepared and vigilant and to take precautionary action , with responsible risk assessment and forward planning , a lot will depend on the availability and effectiveness of anti-virals and vaccines and hospital bed capacity , which has been seriously reduced in all EU countries in the last decade . #% The political zealots in the Commission and in the Council , who support the abolition of duty-free , tell us that the continuation of duty-free is inconsistent with the single market . #% Madam President , in the available time it is not possible to deal with the many challenges facing European agriculture or the role of farming as a central pillar in rural infrastructure . #% Her efforts , I have to say , have sadly not been helped by the failure of the Council to achieve an outcome in this area and , indeed , an unanimous agreement . #% Finally , I must say that there is a need for conservation . #% It is a matter for the Irish administration to decide how to proceed . #% The unit was launched in 1995 , when 12 images were seized . #% I am even more thankful that given the endless , faceless bureaucracy that people have to deal with in our process democracy , we have , as this report points out , a well-intentioned Ombudsman . #% This should allow animal production practices to be adopted and the antibiotics to be replaced by alternative products . #% The strengthening of our long-standing transatlantic relationship is to our mutual benefit . #% With good conservation and better practices , we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing . #% The Seville European Council is important for the many reasons outlined in our resolutions here today . #% It is a real tragedy . #% Europe is not a country , it is a continent and therefore no structures of any known country in the world can be imposed upon it . #% Firstly , biofuels help to reduce over-dependence on oil-based fuels , which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply . #% I agree with Mr Van Orden . #% We will be opposing one amendment , but supporting the overall report . #% These must be based on EU risk evaluation procedures and the opinions of relevant scientific committees , which also allow for peer review . #% That is my appeal - to reflect overnight and tomorrow to put our collective weight behind what is available , for that is what we shall work with . #% On 19 September a Member of this Parliament , while returning from the session in Strasbourg , was invited to an official function in Florence . #% I can not accept that it is impossible for us to find an additional EUR 15 million in the vast budget that we will be approving here in a short period of time . #% I rise specifically , Mr President , to ask you to raise with Mr Uribe , the President-in-Office and the Commission the question of support for a proposed conference on humanitarian rights later this year . #% Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern . #% When will action be taken to protect the citizens of the UK , as well as the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere ? #% For instance , regional tuna management bodies such as ICAT have made great progress in combating fishing by vessels flying flags of convenience . #% We have a situation in which conspiracy theories , innuendo and general misconceptions , lies and myths are told about what goes on in the ` dark corridors ' and ` cubby holes ' of the European Commission . #% We have to look at why they are fleeing from their own countries . #% She has proposed what I think to be a convincing case to the European Convention for inclusion of this provision in an amended treaty . #% If you are looking for the respect and the hearts of the people of Europe , and particularly the young people , why do you not start by reversing the 10 % decrease that the Council of Ministers have proposed in the development cooperation budget ? #% It would not succeed without other mainstream transport infrastructure projects such as the major C ring road , the Dublin port tunnel and the upgrading of the main roads out of the city . #% Relations between the European Union and the United States are inextricably linked . #% What is your opinion on that ? #% There have been those who in the recent past have sought to link the common agricultural policy to the financial perspective . #% According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee , junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period . #% The reality is that the EU economy needs a kick-start . #% Amnesty International has estimated that almost 2 , 000 people were arrested for political reasons in Burma last year . #% The prospect of Ireland entering a large currency zone capable of withstanding external pressures is one which will be welcomed by most Irish people . #% The US forces in Iraq are simply not able to ensure the security of either Iraqis or foreign nationals . #% Now that is also a terrible plight for us in Europe , where people require eggs to eat . #% I am proud to wear the white ribbon to show that I make that stand myself personally . #% It also enhances the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment . #% This is a very worrying aspect . #% However , serious allegations have been made that the Israeli defence forces were involved in extra-judicial executions and the use of human shields . #% There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms . #% I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination . #% Currently there is far too much air pollution , particularly in and around ports . #% We need realistic targets as regards the new directives , but the government feels that it can fully implement this directive by 2011 . #% I have three messages for the Commission at WTO level . #% It is important that these economic partnership agreements contribute towards placing the ACP countries in a position where they can be progressively integrated into the world economy . #% It is important , for example , that we recognise the languages of the new Member States . #% All of us in this House -- if we are lucky enough to live long enough -- will grow old . #% If you are , when exactly are you going to do it ? #% To the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government and the many hundreds of civil servants who have been involved we say a very sincere thank you and we are very proud of you for a job well done . #% Solemnly I salute them today in this House . #% If the concern is to guarantee minimum human rights , then the apparatus already exists under the European Convention on Human Rights at its Court in this city . #% Action needs to be taken quickly to ensure that adequately skilled workers are available to fill these positions . #% The other problem with the common fisheries policy is that on the one hand the Commission has the responsibility but can merely give advice . #% From the perspective of the European Union we must set out exactly the likely future role for the European Union in Iraq . #% 
I would point out that the European Commission and the European Parliament have held extensive consultations with the European automobile industry on these various matters , and it has voluntarily agreed to accept a timetable to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new cars by 25 % by the year 2008 . #% We need credibility , in practice as well as in theory . #% Commissioner , I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and , even though you do not foresee extending the directive , I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers . #% Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State - 12 Member States in fact - under the habitats directive at the moment . #% That is a very welcome development . #% I understand that the International Fund for Ireland has produced a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors ' report , which can be made available to Members . #% I am confident our people will give practical recognition to this fact when they vote next week on the Nice Treaty . #% I just wish to record my thanks and appreciation to the Prime Minister for his very extensive and comprehensive reply . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission 's document . #% I deplore also his attempt to make this Parliament complicit in the decision by NATO to use these weapons . #% The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them , but there is one area that I would like to see developed . #% It is one thing to play at superstatehood in this rarefied House ; it is quite another to face the real issues of our electorate . #% While I , like Miss McIntosh , welcome increased competition in principle , the proposals currently being put forward by Council are badly thought out and ill-considered . #% Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs . #% We may not like what is underneath but we can not fail our children . #% People go to the cinema more often in Ireland than in any other EU country . #% Of course I have voted against it . #% What is important is that Member States be allowed to continue subsidising renewable energy sources which are not yet economically viable . #% I do not support a system of inequality between the levels of funding available to students from the various Member States participating in the Erasmus programme . #% Can I first of all thank you very much for giving me the floor and can I pay tribute to the rapporteur and indeed to Mr Böge . #% You have to be able to give adequate answers to the sort of hostile newspaper articles which are in the United Kingdom 's press today , for example . #% I would urge the European Commission to allocate substantial funds to ensure that this new scheme is widely publicised across the European Union . #% The Verts/ALE Group has therefore tabled amendments asking for the suspension of this agreement in the present situation , particularly because of its unequal benefit for one protagonist -- Israel -- and until more progress has been made towards realistic conflict resolution in the region . #% Madam President , I congratulate the rapporteur and I welcome the Commission proposal for the revision of the current rules concerning recognition of non-EU seafarers . #% Madam President , I may be mistaken but I understood that the intention was indeed to have a resolution . #% To use his own terms , the nature of the impact is unprecedented , and I think that that is a fair point to make in a country of this kind , which is why - and I mention this just in passing - I really do think that the European Union has to be more visible . #% I would also hope that the Belgium presidency would do the same on behalf of the Council for the 15 Member States . #% I am , however , very disappointed that previous Amendments Nos 95 , 76 and 78 which were debated and agreed on by this Parliament have re-emerged in the context of the proposal before the House . #% That question can not be shelved . #% As an Irish citizen , I find it hard to justify to my voters at home why I should be paying a different rate of tax to them or why I should be privileged to pay a lower tax . #% in writing . - The problem of the trafficking of human beings has been with us for a long time , but instead of getting to grips with the issue , Member States stand indicted for our individual and collective failure to deal with this exploitation and degradation of women . #% In reply to queries from my political group , the Commission recently confirmed that the last time it undertook such an audit was in 1993 , nearly a decade ago . #% An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-trading activity . #% Does he agree with me that a directive of this sort would be an excellent contribution towards giving us credibility in the negotiations at Buenos Aires , which will be coordinated - from the European Union 's point of view - by Commissioner Bjerregaard , with whom , I understand , he is working closely ? #% I shall read one paragraph from the report : ` The study concluded that transport had no adverse effect on animal welfare based on the physiological , immunological and haematological measurements made ' . #% Though it was called a period of reflection , its effect was to stop votes in sceptical countries . #% Following the conclusions of the Belgian informal meeting in October , the Commission must now undertake a review of the operation of state aids and regional regeneration policy . #% Whole political and social scenes will be criminalised . #% Ships carry over 70 % of all trade between the Community and the rest of the world . #% I am quite sure that the Council will see the wisdom of these amendments and of the regular and earlier monitoring of the energy star scheme as one , but only one , component of our energy efficient action plan . #% Needless to say , I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance . #% I do not see it this way at all . #% Whatever side of the political divide we come from , we all agree that more needs to be done to achieve a more effective Europe-wide employment strategy . #% Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people . #% Because the Irish Government did not do due diligence in its negotiations with the Commission for the compensation package as part of the closure of Mallow and Carlow under temporary sugar restructuring rules , we now find that the Commission is inflexible about turning these factories into ethanol-producing plants . #% It does credit to the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , Mr Watson . #% I am glad to support the motion and commend it to the House . #% Credit unions are different as they are owned and run by their members . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Emilia Franziska Müller for her patience with me for making her job a lot more difficult than it might otherwise have been . #% As the author of Parliament 's most recent human rights report , I was pleased to see almost all of the thematic issues raised in Parliament 's report dealt with in this document too , reflecting consistency of thought and priority . #% And the societal implications include misuse , pornography , etc. , applications , health , education . #% -- Madam President , this plan proposes to implement actions through existing initiatives and programmes to which resources have already been allocated under the operational budgets of the services concerned , in particular the Public Health Programme and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research . #% I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at European Union level . #% That is why we are asking for a fast-track infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market . #% When we look at the increase in the numbers of people who are over 55 years of age in the European Union there is a social necessity to ensure them ease of access to telecommunication networks at very low cost , sometimes at no cost at all . #% A most recently updated programme adopted last December was framed against a prospect of strong but moderate economic growth and in the medium to long-term the Government intends to continue to run significant budgetary surpluses reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact . #% We all hope for a successful negotiating process , which is due to be launched at an all-ACP level within the next couple of days . #% Fine Gael and Labour are part of the PPE and S&D groups respectively in this Parliament . #% I welcome the agreement which has been secured between the European Parliament and the European Council which represents the fifteen Governments of the European Union on this specific directive . #% Therefore , the opposition you express to Sweden 's social model is not news to me . #% Those who oppose these calls are acting in the interests of a tiny elite of wealthy individuals and corporations who make use of tax havens , and against the many who pay tax and rely on the services it pays for . #% Meat is being brought into the European Community , into the United Kingdom and other countries , and it is not being caught . #% We have in the European Union a common market in beef and in other products . #% I should tell Mr van Dam and the Scottish fishermen , who are now facing the first year of closure and are creating a lot of waves , that the fishermen from my region not only took this in their stride but actually responded in a very positive way . #% I share the view of other colleagues that it is unfortunate to describe the role that this House can play as one merely of observer . #% The problem was that they did not show any independence of mind in challenging culpable business partners and the executive board . #% 
It argued that there is no crisis involving hake and completely removed it from the proposal . #% I also want to congratulate my colleague Mr Cunha on his report . #% I have no doubt but that we , in Parliament , will give them the strongest possible support in their pursuit of justice . #% However , looking at what has been proposed , we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management , which everybody should welcome . #% In Europe , 16 % of citizens still live below the poverty line . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , the Commissioner says that these are ` ambitious goals ' . #% I conclude by saying that all nuclear nations need to state clearly and honestly their programmes for Y2K date compliance , to assure their own and neighbouring nations of their readiness . #% in writing . - Renegotiation of the EU budget will impact on how the Union operates in the coming years and on the programmes it can afford . #% In the report that has been presented there is no impact assessment , not even in respect of what the Commission describes as the engine for economic and employment generation in the Union : the SMEs . #% We can not avoid the other choice and the real question which is : How do we use a finite resource when demand is increasing and we have environmental promises ? #% His objective then he claimed was : ` to eradicate the Palestinian terrorist threat in Lebanon ? . #% We are not able to access the recycling markets easily and the expense involved is considerable for us . #% That is why , in spite of supporting this report , it is important to remain vigilant on all the initiatives taken by the Commission to deal effectively and in a broader way with the problem . #% My next point is the topical question of fraud and irregularity . #% A separate but related matter is that it is high time for a full environmental impact assessment to be carried out on the likely environmental damage that could arise from nuclear shipments across the Irish Sea . #% Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed . #% The Commissioner is right in that we should not get carried away excessively by following every poll but when they are so consistent , underneath it there is a message . #% Less than one-third of Ireland 's trade is with the probable founding countries of EMU , while 70 % of it is with Britain and the rest of the world . #% Mr President , I would appreciate it if your bench would occasionally look in this direction . #% in writing . - Small and medium-size enterprises will play a vital role in reinvigorating economies across Europe that are currently witnessing economic contraction or , at best , slight economic growth . #% We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future . #% The new committee will establish greater transparency , implement Community policies more coherently , reduce bureaucracy and minimise costs . #% We can fully support the vast majority of this report and we welcome many of its recommendations . #% Mr President , hopefully it will be equally on time ! #% I fear , however , that what we are getting is not that . #% As has been said already , it would be completely unacceptable that the arms embargo be lifted , especially in the light of the fact that the Indonesian military have failed to disarm . #% We must give greater attention to enforcing the highest possible safety level for patients , in particular , as many speakers have already said , for vulnerable women . #% Mr President , on a point of order : before you ask the first speaker to make a contribution , I indicated that I wished to be added to the list . #% People are very willing to allow legislation to be put in place and oppressive measures to be brought in because they are concerned about these issues . #% In the last month alone , there were two cases where three Latvian workers and four Polish workers were killed in two separate road accidents . #% There is certainly a long and fraught road ahead , with different banking cultures and legal systems , but there can be no doubt about the bottom line : without provision for efficient cross-border clearing and settlement , the full benefit of an internal market for financial services can not be realised . #% I wonder why ? #% This advertising cheapens all women . #% We have continued to make it clear to the Turkish authorities that observance of the rule of law and basic liberties is the basis of continued rapprochement between the European Union and Turkey . #% I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon . #% I believe it is important that Member States are not legally bound to deploy or accept armed in-flight security officers on domestic or foreign aircraft . #% The CFP needs to combine all aspects of the fishing industry in order to provide a viable future for our fishing communities . #% But that is essential if we are going to provide any kind of proper spatial development to ensure that the population does not drift entirely to the eastern coast . #% The Council 's decision in this matter must be overturned . #% This was the central objective that needed to be achieved during these treaty negotiations and I now believe that the way ahead is clear for candidate countries to join the Union in the near future . #% When we speak of social inclusion as part of EU social policy , we need to ensure that , by our actions , social inclusion is integral to the decisions we take , and this programme has social inclusion written all over it . #% Some people say that there is a tension between these two ideals . #% Second , the only cases of human transmission of bird flu have been where people were in close contact with commercial flocks . #% Putting child-labour concerns at the core of all our trade agreements has to given priority . #% Mr President , I hope my voice is going to hold out . #% There are few more traumatic experiences for children than to be the subject of disputes between parents . #% With regard to the delivery of arms , they would be allowed into countries which have not signed international human rights conventions . #% It does not bode well that we take the opportunity to play politics at this juncture . #% Madam President , my group voted for the Watson report , which is an excellent and very comprehensive one . #% The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective . #% I consider these comments from the chairman of the Convention unacceptable and inappropriate . #% An increasing amount of concern is being expressed in all the Member States about the increase in the incidence of child abduction . #% History has shown that large-scale commercial hunting and sale of wild animals frequently pushes species to the brink of extinction . #% in writing . - The situation with credit ratings agencies must be addressed in Europe . #% This is precisely why a feasibility study to explore the dimensions of that role would be extremely valuable . #% Aquaculture is a natural resource-based industry which is anything but dangerous . #% Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings . #% Is it not absolutely amazing that you see the manic determination to complete the single market with regard to duty free and nothing being done here ? #% It is also unworkable in its current form . #% Until genuine economic equality has been achieved the Commission must be extremely careful not to impose rigorous harmonisation which could lead to a reversal of gains already made . #% They will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture . #% However , I recognize that the reference to an eight-year term for the president is no more for all of us than a fiction , since clearly Mr Duisenberg is unlikely to serve for that length by his own admission . #% Secondly , in relation to advertising , we are concerned about toys being advertised to children during children 's programmes , but we also advertise alcohol to them and are introducing them to alcohol at a very young age and making it acceptable . #% It is impossible to envisage further price cuts without a corresponding increase in direct income support from the EU and the agricultural budget . #% But I want to direct some very pertinent questions to the Commissioner and I hope he will answer those questions in his response . #% This company is also in serious difficulty . #% 
Obviously I am referring here to the UK , Sweden and Denmark . #% I wish to make three brief points . #% Farmers can not accept being treated in this way . #% I need your guidance , as I know it is late procedurally , Mr President , but we need to be sure that what we do and vote on today makes sense and is factually correct . #% The guidelines underline the vital role of urban areas in the European economy . #% We must also end the practice of discarding vulnerable stocks . #% The Employment Committee 's report has considerably expanded this framework . #% I welcome the opportunity to work with you , President Barroso , and with your Commission to deliver on this programme . #% I think we should remember this . #% In committee , a disgraceful amendment was tabled in an attempt to establish a link between what was called Christian fundamentalism and neo-Nazi groups . #% Some of the concerns that have been expressed here tonight , particularly about dealing with illegal content and consumer acceptance , need to be being already pursued by the Commission before we adopt this fully as a European directive . #% We wish Albania to understand clearly that the European Union will only be able to continue to develop its political and economic relations with Albania if progress on the introduction of democratic reforms continue to be made . #% They are there now , as well as the French , Belgians and the Irish . #% From a European perspective , the main purpose of this charter would be to ensure that European companies and organisations can fully participate in the opportunity offered by the Internet and electronic commerce so as to avoid premature and conflicting regulations and to ensure that the interests of consumers are safeguarded at all times . #% It is important that a petition signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe should be given a hearing in this House . #% Madam President , unfortunately most people have left at this stage but I want to draw the House 's attention to the murder by loyalist paramilitaries last Friday of Martin O'Hagan , a journalist . #% When we come to growth , job creation and sustainable jobs , then cost efficiency , high quality and accessible traded public services are at the core of that enterprise . #% It is therefore of the utmost importance that Parliament delivers a favourable opinion this afternoon . #% I think some of the ideas your Presidency is putting forward on research and development will yield dividends for us . #% This House will no longer be the junior partner . #% There are other measures that can help compensate sectors generally in terms of our budget . #% The success of the Irish minister at the Transport Council has been documented here . #% The Hague Convention is meant to do one thing , and one thing only . #% However , certain eye witnesses , NGOs and members of the international press , would claim that the death toll was far higher . #% We have already seen the negative effects in publicity terms of the sanctions and how they are being used by Saddam Hussein to beat Western Europe , as well as the Americans and the UN , and to rally his people back . #% The European Commission has made a proposal which would ensure that consumers would have the right to take action in their own national courts and legal disputes arising from cross-border e-commerce transactions . #% Some amendments will even have a perverse effect . #% Former Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Finucane 's murder and identified the basic requirements for a public enquiry . #% The central contact points will provide information and assistance with regard to the resolution of cross-border disputes within the European Union . #% However , while benefiting from a fall in the euro , they were turning the other cheek within days to be hit with record high oil prices . #% How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals ? #% How can we accomplish anything ? #% We hear all the time that the Unionist population in Northern Ireland feel that they are under siege and under threat . #% The money will be used to re-train workers , help start businesses and provide people with job placements , which are very necessary . #% The total number of companies willing and able to produce influenza vaccines has plummeted in recent years from more than two dozen in 1980 to just a handful in 2004 . #% In particular , I welcome the funding for sustainability and renewable energy in this programme . #% The promise of full compensation for price cuts given in 1992 has not been honoured in Agenda 2000 decisions , and while farmers suffer much lower prices , the cost of the common agricultural policy continues to rise . #% Today the European Council is deciding whether to write the public out of the GMO process . #% How best do we serve this purpose ? #% This should be condemned by Parliament as contrary to the rule of law . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Wiebenga . #% We certainly know that this is an important contribution to both those priorities . #% A further 67 FOC longliners built in Taiwan will be repatriated to replace older vessels , with no overall increase in fleet capacity . #% I also restate my view that the compensation proposed is totally inadequate and must be immediately increased . #% This is a diplomatic issue and one that must be raised urgently . #% Kyoto is only a first step towards addressing global warming but it provides a crucial foundation on which future , more comprehensive and effective policies and agreements must be built . #% Look at what happened in the last GATT round : the EU traded in a principled way our agricultural rights for other non-agricultural areas . #% I would like to make the following recommendations to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention . #% The reality is that very few young people kick the habit of smoking during their lives . #% Madam President , I should like to say that it is a decision made by the Irish people , whether we like it or not , and I do not particularly like it . #% It is also important that a strong culture of openness and cooperation exists between the Commission , the national , regional and local authorities . #% This should be done far more frequently in a whole range of Community policy areas , because there are some Member States that take advantage of the markets created by those Member States that do transpose , while not playing fair themselves . #% Many of us who have served loyally on the European Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries for many years have found ourselves sidelined in the interests of expediency . #% Ten years after Rio , expectations have not been met . #% The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat overshadowed by the substantial interest in paragraph 29 of the resolution . #% Personally , I am an enthusiastic supporter of enlargement but equally I have strong views as to how that enlarged Europe should be constructed . #% I plead with you to intervene on her behalf so that she can be treated humanely and decently . #% We need to begin to audit these policies to make sure we are in line with our own objectives within the Treaty . #% Mr President , I also wish to join with the others in thanking the rapporteur for his work on a very important topic which has become even more so in the last year because of the increase in unemployment across many economies in the European Union . #% Madam President , I too welcome the decision to introduce a European health insurance form card and congratulate the rapporteur for her clarity and perseverance . #% To generate greater sales of Fair Trade terms for the benefit of more marginalised producers , it is important to involve commercial manufacturers and to encourage Fair Trade supply to supermarkets , where most people do their shopping . #% We also continue to have a serious problem for abductions outside the Community . #% Given that the Commission is broadly in agreement with the Parliament 's proposals , I call on this House to make their voice heard in ensuring that the European Council also supports this report 's environmental proposals . #% Yes , in the past the agreements have been acceptable , but we need a new approach and a new vision in the future . #% -- I should like to thank the Commissioner for his reply . #% I have to retire owing to health reasons , but I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in this Parliament , and of course to the Commission and the Council , for the outstanding support that they gave to peace in Northern Ireland . #% 
It is correct that Parliament voted down this compromise as it only sought to undermine agreements in Berlin . #% We believe that he has represented Parliament at European Councils and throughout the regions of this Union with authority and with distinction . #% Mr President and Commissioner , in introducing this report on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms , I can be confident that the proposals are based on sound scientific advice . #% Surely you now understand fully the meaning of my question and will reply to it and ensure that these monies , which were illegally removed by dictators and terrorists , are returned to the people in the various former colonies ? #% You should make sure that you use all the budget that is set aside each year already under the existing programme . #% I totally disagree with Mrs Baldi . #% The ushers themselves have tried their very best to be diplomatic , but they are subjected , and I use the word advisedly , to abuse by some smokers when they ask them to stop smoking outside the doors . #% I hope that the House lends its full support to this important resolution . #% The ultimate crime is to do nothing , to neglect our duty to protect children everywhere including those who are forced into child prostitution . #% Therefore health and safety should be our foremost concern . #% The question is : have you the will to do better , or is all the talk mere platitudes and empty words ? #% So there is a serious mistake there . #% Livelihoods and biodiversity suffer as a result of overexploitation of wildlife for food . #% Mr President , with just six months to go before the introduction of the euro notes and coins , we must focus clearly on this event . #% The intention is to show that it is applied in a balanced and proportionate way and it should be stressed that the directive must not be used to abuse the right of legitimate competitors to enter the market place , in particular that for generic medicines . #% We also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills . #% I would appreciate persistence in pursuing the issue of Mr de Roo 's amendments . #% We would like to see that happen during the Irish presidency and we would like to see the Commission come on board too . #% Is it not the case that you will predetermine the national priorities of the Member States on where they wish to spend their structural fund money and state aid under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) ? #% Other points can certainly -- and probably will -- be made in political dialogue . #% The Fianna Fail delegation in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Supplementary Budget to finance the `` mad cow '' eradication programme , and the associated resolution - but not without serious reserves . #% We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work . #% It is based on the existing general systems directives and aims to consolidate 15 directives into one streamlined and simplified piece of legislation , which hopefully will clarify issues of interpretation . #% We should be helping communities and civilisation by putting resources into education , health and other important areas where money is needed , instead of using resources to boost the arms industry . #% We have had a peace process in place for ten years or more . #% Mr President , it is a very sensitive time to be discussing an issue like this . #% Can the Council provide an updated assessment on the status of Iceland 's application to join the European Union ? #% Mr President , there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities . #% No other EU policy change will impact in such a profound and personal way on all citizens and at the same time . #% As far as the Lisbon agenda is concerned , I say to our Taoiseach that we have failed yet again to deliver progress on our much-quoted ambition for the EU to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% All the precedent case-law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base -- Article 95 in this case -- and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base -- Article 175 . #% For example , the EU 's new directive on regulating pollutants obliges oil companies to sign up to ensuring that the sulphur content in petrol is cut by a threefold reduction and that the sulphur content in diesel is cut by a seven-fold reduction by the year 2005 . #% I welcome the three-phase peace plan proposed here . #% I support the amendments on needle-stick injuries and injuries to healthcare workers . #% We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act . #% in writing . - The financial and resultant economic crisis have dwelt a huge blow to European growth and the stability of the job market . #% We hope , therefore , for some limited success at Barcelona to take forward in a responsible way not a free-for-all , but a controlled competitive market . #% In view of the statement given by Commissioner Frattini during the debate on Monday and his commitment to look at the effects of this regulation and the civil justice laws for parties domiciled in third countries , in particular the States of the European Economic Area , the groups have agreed not to insist on Amendment 1 . #% ` Here ' being a vague and incomprehensible mess that will be defined in our courts . #% Medicine should be kept out of food . #% Mr President , it is clear , as Mrs Green said , that we are now in a position where we have established the principles from the earlier vote , and we should try to accommodate that at this stage . #% The Bulgarian criminal justice system has not given Michael a fair trial . #% I was pleased to hear President Santer acknowledge that mistakes were made by the Commission . #% This work is very encouraging . #% We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected . #% The real problem is that the costs of producing food are rising faster , and this is a treadmill on which farmers can not continue . #% Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry . #% The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard . #% It is quite appropriate that we should be reforming the Commission 's foreign delegations and examining how they can perform in a much more efficient way , hopefully in the context of a much more coherent common foreign and security policy . #% Your attempts to resuscitate it are as distasteful as they are ill-fated . #% I would also question why it is that the Irish presidency is not here today . #% Finally , I wish that all Members of this House could come and see the difference this makes to grass roots communities . #% If there will be outside technical assistance , who will be operating it ? #% For this reason , I can not support Amendment 57 , which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a hard-won first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned . #% The 1999 recommendation requires an update within five years of it being published that takes into account ongoing research . #% With the benefit of hindsight we have not in the context of world trade provided the degree of protection necessary for our farmers from the obvious unfair competition and market manipulation by our competitors . #% The buck stops nowhere if not with us here in the European Parliament , where , through the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , we are co-legislators with the Council . #% There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply . #% I do not therefore have a problem with her technical proposals nor indeed the Commission ' s proposals . #% The Irish Minister for Agriculture has stipulated that she will prioritise in favour of young farmers . #% So I hope we can raise this at the meeting of the Bureau later today . #% Unfortunately , these oppressed people look to the billionaire and former Prime Minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , for a solution . #% In the light of this , I should like to ask Commissioner de Palacio to retract comments she made in December on the death of the Kyoto Treaty and request that she seek to revive that Treaty and redouble her efforts in getting Russia to join . #% 80 % of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region . #% For example , instead of having to collect an E111 form before travelling , and then having to go through various bureaucratic procedures before receiving care , they will , through the card , have immediate access to the care they need . #% The EU , the said , is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation . #% 
Sometimes it is better to say less than more in these issues . #% I find the President-in-Office 's remarks quite amazing . #% The environmental impact of pirate fishing vessels is virtually impossible to evaluate as by definition data on catches are non-existent or , at the very best , unreliable . #% We need to continue to deliver a road map of cohesive solutions to the threat of climate change , ensuring that Member State flexibility is at its heart . #% Could you provide us with information on that ? #% Nevertheless , discard is not only about juvenile catches but is also about the harm done to fish stocks . #% I have been in contact with the Irish Minister responsible for language matters and I believe that it would be very difficult to sustain the same level of interest in the Bureau among Irish government circles , should the Bureau be forced to close its Dublin office . #% In fact , it is ironic that the governments of the new Member States are the ones giving the lead on how to resolve the financial perspectives issue . #% It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country . #% One of the most significant issues that must come from any review is to demonstrate clearly to the consumer who is responsible in the event of these delays and cancellations . #% The tóraidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion . #% I should like to ask , when we talk about children who are abandoned in maternity hospitals and the issue of inter-country adoption , that we put the child at the centre of this issue , rather than any other concerns . #% I believe that within the present text we have the opportunity to reconcile these two parties , and to lay down a number of fundamental principles which could be copied in other parts of the world . #% I would call upon the Council to adopt them this week . #% I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in this House . #% The day after tomorrow , the former Minister of Finance , Mr McCreevy , will be sitting on those benches beside you , Mrs Wallström , in charge of the internal market . #% We only caught , apparently , an average of 3 000 tonnes , and yet we are increasing the number of vessels being sent there . #% We do not want to see a situation where a limitless patent system can be abused by large operatives to stifle technical competition or , even worse , prevent the publication of information . #% Little wonder that in their day-to-day lives so many citizens are questioning Europe 's ability to deliver the goods , because they know that action speaks louder than words . #% I come from an island country , in which we have 35 , 000 troops also from another country in part of that island . #% Is the Commission in a position to give us reassurances in relation to the Armagh case straddling the border between the north of Ireland and the Republic , where we have word today of a suspect case again ; sheep imported from Carlisle Mart , some of which have apparently travelled onward down south to the Republic . #% Until now , his government has not seemed to bother about serious infringement . #% I believe it is vital that the European Parliament does not lose its joint legislative power with the Council on the issue of development policy . #% Madam President , I have been indicating for a long time that I wished to speak . #% Finally , a word on procedure . #% I have to say that I am slightly disappointed because I have not heard any real proposal . #% Furthermore , given the present geo-political climate , with the increased possible threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe , we should consider how best to prevent such an attack occurring . #% Again , the subsidies can be creamed off by people in the middle as well as creating immense opportunities for irregular practices . #% I agree that the Commission paper of last spring is insufficient , particularly in relation to short-term aid . #% The report 's proposal for the development of a strategy at EU level to address the impact of adverse weather conditions on EU agriculture is very welcome and indeed very pertinent , considering the exceptionally harsh climatic conditions experienced by farmers over the past months . #% I challenge the British authorities to let the consumers make up their own minds and ensure that Irish beef is sold in British supermarkets . #% I certainly feel very strongly about this . #% My own country never applied for reduced rates . #% Consumers will only participate in sorting and recovery schemes if they are simple to manage and if good collection of separated waste bags is available . #% Frankly , we need to be a little bit more constructive than that . #% I would like to ask you , Commissioner , are you going to push much further with the Irish government and explore every possible avenue . #% The illegal drugs trade is now a sophisticated international business . #% It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way with the Madrid conference , which enshrined the land for peace principle . #% I would cite , for example , the references to the treatment of prisoners and the protection of children . #% I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants , who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted , fluoridated tap water . #% Having said that , we have a population of 4 million people , and we export 90 % of our production . #% In relation to waste , the problem with Ireland is that it is failing to comply with the waste directive . #% Mr President , I express my disappointment at my Green colleagues and my own group , because I was left with no opportunity to vote on two key amendments on the common , foreign and security policy . #% It is the first COP -- I accept that -- and perhaps we will not have as much to report as we would like because we are only developing structures and strategies to deal with this most important issue . #% It seems that Parliament does not accept the common definition of a refugee , based on the full inclusive definition , which would cover gender-related persecution , include both state and non-state persecution and take account of the applicant 's fear of further persecution . #% The Union first established contractual links with Albania in 1992 and in due course the Commission will submit a draft mandate to the Council for negotiations with Albania regarding a new bilateral agreement . #% The Nice Treaty in no way affects this status . #% John Hume , a former member of the Socialist Group was the architect of the PEACE programme and its contribution to reconciliation has been enormous . #% Once the new budgetary procedure begins next September , I will be seeking support once again for such a move . #% Mr President , I very much welcome this report on the transportation of radioactive material within the European Union . #% The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world . #% I very much agree with what my colleague Mrs Doyle said , and I do not actually feel that the Commissioner answered her questions adequately . #% But we also know only too well the enormous benefits that accrue to everyone when violence ends and real negotiation and dialogue take place . #% Only 8 countries have stepped up to the mark in providing a more formal analysis or Statement of Assurance , and sadly Ireland is not one of them . #% In this context a proposal such as the guarantee fund , which puts in place a fourth building block in the development of the infrastructure of the Community audiovisual market is to be welcomed . #% Though the number of people suffering from HIV has stabilised in recent years in Europe , the problem of AIDS is still a very real one particularly in the more deprived and disadvantaged urban areas and of course , within the African continent . #% I would underline to Commissioner Potočnik that it is absolutely imperative that Community funding for research be substantially increased under the Seventh Framework Programme . #% The state of the Union reflects that where we have the political vision and will , we succeed ; where we lack those qualities , we do not . #% I am also pleased to note from opinion polls in Iceland that 65 % of the Icelandic people want the negotiations to continue . #% I am glad , because it would send a very dangerous signal at this time . #% While the European economy is performing strongly , we must equally ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a structured and streamlined manner . #% Mr President , the unanimous sign-off of this emissions trading directive in December 2002 at the Council of Ministers was a major wake-up call to corporate Europe and a signal that this was actually going to happen . #% In the industrial and service sector such a cut would never be accepted but farmers are expected to put up with the vagaries of world market prices which are currently at rock bottom across a range of commodities . #% The report seeks to ensure that funding is increased at least in line with inflation for critical social policy expenditure at this time of rising unemployment . #% Outstanding differences of opinion need to be ironed out in a committed and systematic way to break the remaining deadlock . #% We must engage in a continuing and vigorous dialogue with our transatlantic partners in the USA and with Russia where the very name of Kyoto has become discredited . #% 
That is the first step : reply to the letters of the Commission . #% If the policy did not exist , if we left it entirely to market forces , there is no question but that the flight from the land would have been very much accelerated . #% Their coverage shows quite clearly that we spoke out against the regime , that we insisted on full cooperation with the weapons inspectors and that we brought up past issues such as the gassing of the Kurds . #% That is the message of my group today . #% We need to know if all the sacrifices that fishermen have made in the past have done anything to help the fishing industry , and the scientific evidence should be produced if they have it . #% Now others stand on the edge of that very same precipice . #% Your remarks were particularly welcome in view of the proposal to do away with the Committee on Women 's Rights . #% I would like to know which legal base you are using to consult Member States on these issues . #% It is in the area of the intergovernmental conference that the Irish presidency has passed on its greatest legacy . #% We should therefore enhance the role of regional and local government in responding to and developing European policy . #% As a result of the damage to my brain I have been registered as blind with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland . #% However , the institutions of the Union have yet to grasp the importance of this task . #% I would say to the Commission that if we are to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of decision-making , we must reassure our citizens that their specific concerns have been taken into consideration . #% His family have no information on the state of his health , either physical health or mental health . #% Mr President , I really welcome this opportunity to speak . #% Mr President , the Community budget is the blood supply to a sustainable common agricultural policy . #% However , other parts of the report criticise EU environmental and health and food safety requirements . #% But the reward for your success , which is what we expect and what we will help you with , will be a new confirmation of the wisdom of working together in international cooperation in the European Union . #% Member States must make a payment towards the central budget to ensure that we can assist those countries most in need , and to ensure that we can continue to drive forward Europe as a dynamic , innovative and creative centre . #% The final plan for the liberalization of gas markets in Europe will be put in place before the end of the Irish presidency of the EU this year . #% Madam President , I fundamentally disagree with many of the aspects of the European Commission 's proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy . #% Why do we not deal with this subject as a whole ? #% Since this period , Burundi has lurched from crisis to crisis , with many thousands of people losing their lives in the process . #% Where was ECHO ? #% On this occasion it is crucial . #% Since trade policy was foolishly handed over to the exclusive competence of the EU , the plain truth is that Member States are powerless to act in the face of cheap imports ravaging their textile industry . #% I have to say that my comments are not addressed to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies , because we know of her commitment to cohesion policy , but to the whole College of Commissioners . #% The same problems exist in the UK : 52 models examined in the UK are still more expensive . #% Across Europe and the world , it behoves us all to stand resolutely against it and its despicable apologists . #% Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the good debate we had yesterday with the High Representative , Javier Solana . #% This is an important policy objective because it will ensure that on entry these countries can participate within the Union in a competitive climate . #% And the matter does not end there . #% To conclude , here is a short quote , which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem . #% It is a fact that many small firms struggle because of late payments . #% I will certainly draw the exchanges in this Question Time to the attention of Minister Yates , who is President-in-Office of the Agriculture Council to ensure that he is aware of the concerns of the honourable Member . #% Mr President , having served as a politician in both parts of Ireland I am only too well aware of the difficulties in trying to negotiate an agreement which will be acceptable to all parties to the conflict . #% In that sense I welcome the statement of the Commission , although I am concerned about the comments of the Council . #% In 1991 the Council banned the use of driftnets longer than 2.5 kilometres in all regions except the Baltic Sea . #% However , some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process . #% We have had a tribunal , known as the Lindsey tribunal , which was wound up recently , having sat for some time trying to resolve the very tragic cases of patients , many of whom have since died , who received infected blood . #% It updates Directive 90/426/EEC on the import of equidae and Directive 92/65/EEC on animal health requirements governing trade in imports into the Community of animals , semen , ova and embryos . #% They do not cover a number of serious issues like Plan Colombia and the grave human rights abuses that are taking place in the country . #% In the end the single currency will prove an asset to the Community . #% In order to rebuild this trust , there has to be a complete crackdown on illegal fishing . #% This report endorses the aims and proposals set out by the G20 and the Basel Committee , to ensure banks hold sufficient amounts of capital of a suitable quality , and that they have the liquidity and stable funding necessary to withstand tough market conditions . #% In relation to services , however , we have had over 50 years of Member State protectionism and restrictive practices , from complicated bureaucratic hurdles and time delays to financial penalties to obscure qualification requirements . #% They should do this next Tuesday at the meeting of the Transport Council . #% Let me conclude by warmly thanking the Irish presidency for the courtesy it has extended to the Groups of this Parliament and to Parliament itself and for taking on board the concerns of this Parliament . #% A total of 30 countries presently take part . #% in writing . - I fully support the concept of the Internal Market Scoreboard as a tool for measuring the success of the single market . #% There is little point in being all things to all people at all times . #% I would , however , like to focus on the proposal to include the chemicals used in tobacco products under REACH . #% First of all I would like to support very much what my colleague Mr Piétrasanta said and say that our group will be voting for the reports by Mr Piétrasanta and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna . #% There is no doubt that this reform of structural and Cohesion Funds represents the most significant changes in the last ten years with a view to meeting the challenges of enlargement and EMU . #% For example , the Italians have successfully moved into overseas markets , based on their strength and customer service , and they have actually avoided competing head-on with low cost imports . #% It is irresponsible for anyone to suggest that this is in the interests of consumers . #% Racist violence , alas , is now prevalent throughout Europe and must be vigorously addressed . #% A recent evaluation of the EU product licensing procedures observed , and I quote , `` significant concern in the veterinary sector about the decreased availability of established medicinal products for food-producing animals as a result of the introduction of the MRL requirements . '' #% Traditionally , of course , in the EU , it was women 's work , although that is changing . #% I recently received correspondence from a dairy farmer in County Westmeath , whose herd of prized dairy cows has been all but obliterated since he first discovered TB on his farm less than a year ago . #% It is based on respect for people with different ideas and focuses on ways to work together . #% At the outset I want to compliment Mr Chichester on the preparation and presentation of this report . #% We have come a long way , as Mr Mulder knows , from the days when 80 % of the budget of the European Union was spent on agriculture . #% If we are serious about the attainment of equality , we must , on an ongoing basis , not only guarantee equality of opportunity across those categories , but we must be in a position to measure accurately and adequately outcomes as against each of those categories . #% This is forcing quarry owners to move from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland in order to compete , because otherwise they can not . #% Mr President , I wanted to make a point of order because I wish to congratulate you on your patience on taking us through this vote . #% 
Therefore we have to accept our own responsibility for that . #% However , the Internal Market Committee insists that all legislative proposals be accompanied by a quality impact assessment , a summary and a better regulation checklist on internal market proposals . #% We would indicate that we want them to join as soon as possible and as soon as they fulfil the necessary conditions . #% They do not allow it to force countries to increase taxes , and they do not allow it to force countries to lower taxes . #% The Irish Inherited Disorders Organization has complained that it was misled and misinformed and its position misrepresented . #% This is something that must be a priority for the EU , we can not allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses . #% I can support paragraph 9 of the resolution on the assumption that the rapporteur is referring to regions such as the Azores and Madeira . #% Any suggestions from any quarter that Ireland should suffer as a result of the success of the Irish economy is a very serious threat . #% Restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinian leadership does not contribute to fighting terror . #% Consequently , this has had broader repercussions in sending a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself . #% Each individual brand should list all additives , not just the prohibited ingredients . #% If the Treaty is ratified in the proper way , if Parliament is properly consulted and gives its assent , then of course we have an obligation to meet the spending . #% I trust he will learn over the next six months to become consistent and no longer tell us to accept something that he would not tolerate . #% I appeal , therefore , for some common sense in this debate . #% Banditry is rife in Baghdad and on all major transport routes leading to the capital . #% These failures should not be sidestepped in arguments about proportionality or protectionism . #% The framework decision would apply to laboratory activities relating to DNA and fingerprints , and each Member State ensures that the results of the accredited laboratory activities carried out in other Member States are recognised as equivalent to the results of the accredited domestic laboratory activities . #% At the end of the day maybe we should consider whether surveillance should become a Community responsibility , because at the moment Member States are not fulfilling their obligation . #% The work of the Council must be more consistent , and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council . #% I thank the Commissioner for her reply . #% Although the Ukraine authorities have pledged to dismantle the plant by the year 2000 in exchange for international aid for the harnessing of alternative sources of energy , closure can not come quick enough . #% In essence , dual pricing campaigns across Europe in all key supermarkets and shopping outlets must now begin . #% We know that the internal market is said to have created over 2.5 million jobs within the last ten years alone . #% I hope that will be forthcoming . #% There is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises . #% Products from outside the United Kingdom may be organically produced , though in truth little is known as to whether environmental damage is done in producing some of those goods . #% It is a point which deserves particular attention well in advance of the actual introduction of the currency . #% This annual procedure should be looking at the state of the agriculture industry , its long-term viability , recognizing that our share in world production is becoming ever reduced . #% There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies , something which must be combated . #% in writing . - Aviation security issues are of the utmost importance to our safety and need to be dealt with in a swifter manner than has so far been the case . #% European initiatives to reduce the level of drug abuse in Europe must be supported at every opportunity . #% In the overall context of the peace process in Ireland , the European Union has been at the forefront in providing political and financial support -- and it is clear that it will continue to play an active and central role in this regard . #% I have already talked about going native in regard both to Euratom and the UK inspectorate . #% I regret that it is not going to be easy . #% There are currently 13 companies in Ireland , mostly from the accommodation sector , that are Ecolabelled but we need to encourage further participation . #% Over 120 women have been murdered since 1996 , a significant number by a partner or ex-partner . #% There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry . #% Mr President , on 15 January about 40 000 indigenous people and small peasants lost their villages , provisions and fields . #% We should welcome Romania and Bulgaria , congratulate their officials , their governments and their people for what they have achieved so far , remember the horrors that they have come through and look forward to the bright future that lies ahead for them and for us . #% I did not believe the justifications given stood up to scrutiny , and this has proven to be the case . #% The budget is inadequate . #% We need to protect our fish stocks and not decimate them . #% At the same time , I would expect the donors to insist that the Bhutanese Government facilitate a rapid repatriation of the refugees . #% Those differences are not of a personal nature , but in what we see as the best vision for the future . #% The bottom line is simply this : the roadmap remains the mostly likely framework within which to achieve a resolution to the Israel -- Palestine conflict . #% The opportunities now presented to us by this process should be grasped , but it should not be predetermined that everybody gets what they want . #% In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Famagusta and since then the city has been fenced off . #% But in micro-economic terms at the level of the salmon industry consider the implications of Norway , a state outside the Union which produces a massive surplus for export - and has the potential to produce much more in the immediate future - and floods our market to such an extent that the anti-dumping case when it is examined will hold . #% In all the regions of the EU which are just emerging from economic backwardness we must realise that there is still a serious burden of the past to be carried . #% Neither Mrs Nicole Pery , who has left this Parliament , nor the working party , made any suggestions concerning the application of this rule . #% I believe this must continue . #% Europe 's institutional framework still needed to be overhauled , decision-making had to be made more democratic and brought closer to the citizens and Europe had to meet its responsibilities to the rest of the world , especially the developing world if the project is to help in bringing the globalisation process under democratic control . #% This is evident under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) , Objective 1 areas , and the principle is very strongly adhered to in this area . #% The Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency will carry a huge responsibility . #% Our policy on development aid focuses on good governance and respect for human rights and it certainly does not seem to be the case here . #% I want to impress on the Commission and the Community the importance of showing sympathy and solidarity with China in this horrific disaster and urgently extending what help they can . #% We , on the left in Ireland , will insist that it goes to a referendum of the Irish people before it is passed . #% I know , for example , that it is extremely difficult to find an airline 's complaints department . #% The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council . #% It is not , however , good enough just to pay lip service to their work . #% That is why the safeguard clauses are there . #% It increasingly resorts to the use of the Internal Security Act , which allows it to detain people indefinitely without trial if , in the Government 's view , they are suspected of threatening national security . #% I believe that establishing and maintaining contacts with the peoples of the Union 's Southern and Eastern neighbours through education and training activities is of crucial importance . #% It is a pity that the US has not lived up to its responsibilities . #% It is a central tenet of the Lisbon Agenda that legislation should be simple , clear and enforceable . #% I should just like to ask the President-in-Office if there will be compensation available because of the cuts and what effect this will have on the livelihoods of fishermen ? #% 
We must remember , in terms of immigration , that mercy and tolerance must be our first preoccupation . #% It is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights . #% Michael Courtney was known to many of us here in Strasbourg when he served as Observer to this Parliament . #% Northern Ireland fishermen have made great sacrifices in the past but they are now being convinced that the knife has been turned on them . #% I will continue to support workers and trade unionists in their struggle against the increase in the retirement age . #% The forces there can not responsibly administer day-to-day activities in the country . #% Furthermore , the leadership of the KCTU 's union was made illegal through removing the status of union membership from dismissed workers . #% It is only when we receive full explanations that we can give this support . #% It is a real shame on us and the other European institutions that we can not respond to these kinds of disasters . #% CAP reform was undoubtedly sold as a means to protect agricultural tariffs from future attack . #% However , what is important is the next stage : transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold . #% No reference has been made to the need for the transfer of prisoners which could go a long way to restoring the IRA cease-fire . #% At the half-way point to the 2012 deadline set under the first Kyoto commitment period , the world is engaging in rationalisation , hammering nails in the coffin of attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before we even enter the second phase of implementation . #% If you cut the ability of the working class to purchase goods and services , then you cut demand for those goods and services , which means you cut millions more jobs of workers who would provide them . #% I also feel that Turkey must consider repealing clause 301 of its Penal Code , which is being used to charge dozens of Turkish writers with insulting Turkishness . #% The summit should concentrate on elaborating broad political guidelines concerning this package of proposals which will have a major impact , not just on the functioning of the European institutions but also on the daily life of the citizens over the coming years . #% The European Commission , in its communication on the renewed social agenda , states : ` The Commission calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions that are up to date ' . #% The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize , Honduras , the Netherlands Antilles , Panama and many others . #% There has been no change in the agreement . #% We devote a lot of time in the European Union to making sure that the highest standards in farming are met ; our livestock is well treated and healthy ; our produce is safe ; our farming practices ethical in relation to their impact on the environment . #% Moreover , women of all ages often care for young and elderly dependents . #% So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public-private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union , which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money . #% It is important that we support the continuation of the SAVE energy efficiency programme with a budget of ECU 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 . #% The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction . #% No action has been taken so far on any of the seven proposals which , as it happens , arose from a report which I had the privilege to introduce into this House . #% As we are aware there is an EU Communicable Diseases Network which has been in existence since 1999 . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , rising food prices can bring governments to their knees . #% There are many other small projects like that , which are run by individuals who saw the need . #% Nonetheless , I warmly welcome the British Presidency 's commitment to getting Europol established and its interest in promoting international efforts to tackle the illegal drugs business . #% Forced labour continues , despite agreements with the ILO . #% However the underlying thesis is correct . #% I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor , help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world . #% I know the Commissioner is aware of this . #% Two days ago the Legal Service of Parliament , acting as the agents of the House and , under that power of delegation , made a presentation to the European Court of Justice in respect of a case brought by Eurotunnel on the sensitive question of duty-free sales . #% The EU must not put further obstacles in the way of economic growth and stability . #% The Roadmap also calls for the immediate dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001 . #% It is ironic on the eve of the millennium that we are discussing the working conditions of doctors who are working in what could only be described as Dickensian situations . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Collins and Mrs Jöns for their excellent work here in relation to the structural funds for Ireland . #% We believe in a strong Europe , we believe in a strong Commission and we believe we should be natural allies - let us work to that end . #% However , with Urban II coming to an end , a similar need in highly deprived areas in East and South Belfast remains unmet . #% The report is already a compromise report and is not as strong as I certainly would like it to be . #% The disabled will be excluded from the opportunities if there are not sufficient guarantees of access across Europe to public payphones , directory services and electronic programme options . #% The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% We may not agree with them and may not ascribe to them ourselves , but we should respect the right of Members of this House and other elected representatives to hold those opinions and try to bring them forward . #% In addition , because of service cutbacks , women who availed of child care and elder-care , learning support , etc. , are being forced to quit employment to assume those tasks themselves . #% We need to fight discrimination wherever it is found not just in the workplace . #% I welcome the decision on satellite surveillance of fishing . #% We should also recall that we have worked very closely together in the battle against international terrorism . #% Credit is certainly due to the Commission , which has consistently supported the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages . #% I hope that the report is adopted without difficulty here tomorrow . #% in writing . - I support this report which seeks , in light of the EU 's commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and halve extreme poverty by 2015 , to address the most pressing health problems in sub-Saharan Africa and the question of what systems can be put in place to do so . #% Europe must advance with social progress hand in hand with economic progress . #% It is about ensuring that the world itself is a better place for future generations . #% A sensible solution would be that if the French and the Irish and British are forced out because their system of fishing is unacceptable , then obviously the Spanish fleets will catch more fish and they could concede to the Irish and the British and the French other quotas of similar value and everybody would be happy . #% I do not have another question , I simply wanted to remind the Commissioner that there was a second part to my original question , i.e. whether the matter would be brought up in the Security Council . #% Serial hijacking of huge consignments of cigarettes is acknowledged to be the work of the IRA . #% Mr President , for those who still cling to the European dream , Mr Juncker 's presidency has been a stunning failure . #% We also feel that the Council should wake up and join the real world , because it seems to think that this is unnecessary . #% While the summit did not result in any significant decisions , it certainly provided a valuable opportunity for the heads of state or government to discuss the state of progress of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3 500 farmers will be very badly affected . #% The international difficulties which surrounded the war in Iraq were many , but I believe that in the context of its presidency of the European Union the Greek Government dealt with this difficult political matter as even-handedly as possible . #% Eurozone leaders tell us that there is no Greek debt restructuring , but since when is a delay of a repayment date not a restructuring ? #% The situation in Ireland is quite contrary to this principle . #% It is reprehensible that young people in Lithuania coping with their emerging sexuality - which is a difficult enough time - must now do so in a climate of intolerance and fear . #% I strongly urge EU governments and the European Commission to make available long-term financial assistance to help the Iranian Government with these difficult regeneration tasks . #% It is important that this House shows solidarity to those people . #% 
Whilst this is a welcome change in the way in which the Commission looks at fisheries agreements , it should take the same approach with the ACP agreements . #% I will support those higher standards . #% It also raises questions for the transport of nuclear material such as MOX fuel and , indeed , for nuclear safeguards because of the production of plutonium stockpiles . #% Mr President , after the last vote , I would now ask that you put immediately to the vote the other amendments tabled by the other groups to the effect that we should not have a transitional period . #% We can only begin to imagine the effect of any kind of nuclear scare - just a scare - on these sectors of our economy . #% Yes there may be legal means to get us over the legal niceties but there is within this a political signal and message and the signal must be , that however we may criticise the Nice Treaty , and we all do , we must get over that hurdle as a precondition politically not to do with enlargement but to do it ourselves . #% For example in relation to water , soil , our health , flora , fauna and indeed climate , it is extremely important that proper information is made available . #% We can sit back on our laurels and wait and see . #% We have been asked to trust Member States . #% The Prestige disaster highlights not only the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation which you referred to in your answer , designed to prevent the recurrence of such incidents , but also the lack of an adequate EU response mechanism . #% Many of us in this Parliament deal on a regular basis with human rights in the world . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Fatuzzo on his report . #% I am not quite sure where we stand on that but we will be advised . #% It is also about lack of recognition and about hindrances at national level whereby the internal market is not completed . #% I believe the best way we can help East Timor is to openly criticise our EU partners who are arming the Indonesian dictatorship that has subjected the Timorese to 20 years of murder , rape , torture and oppression . #% The majority will ultimately win , but those who disagree can make this a better debate , and they should be encouraged to do so and should not be disenfranchised from their position . #% I want to thank the German Government and the German Members of Parliament for their understanding of this particular case and for their support for my campaign for the proper treatment of prisoners in English jails . #% I can say that we have left no stone unturned in tackling this problem , including the removal of entire herds where an infected animal has in fact been diagnosed . #% I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step , but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid . #% The OIE meets next week in Paris to consider amendments to their classification system and consequently I hope to bring further amendments to this regulation for second reading . #% If the Commission calls it an EU delegation , then the three EU parties who are present should be treated equally . #% It is clear that we need a Community patent and that it is a key element in underpinning the Lisbon agenda of encouraging EU innovation and competitiveness . #% I would like to pay tribute to the support given by the chairman of the committee , Mr Newman . #% I urge the Council of Ministers and the Commission not to let us down in this regard . #% The European Council , which represents the fifteen Governments of the EU , originally did not include any provisions relating to the elimination of hazardous substances in this new Water Directive . #% The proposal to reduce export subsidies is both misplaced and ill judged , especially since it is aimed at forcing a policy decision , mainly a reduction in the transport of live animals . #% We must use the powers we have to force Member State governments to convene another IGC and rectify the failures of Amsterdam . #% I should like to refer briefly to one or two points President Barroso made in his presentation . #% That is not to say that there are not problems or areas of dispute . #% Needless to say , I disagree with my Irish colleague , Mrs McKenna , because I believe that the establishment of an EU defence policy is as much an essential prerequisite of genuine European integration as the single currency . #% Remarkably , one priority is a European House of History . #% The decision of the British government to expand the operations of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a contentious one by any stretch of the imagination . #% All foreign investment - we should remember - takes place through military-backed companies . #% The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities , as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese . #% Thirdly , the Member States will have to redesign their pension scheme policies - and this has been mentioned too by many speakers - so that the principle of solidarity between the generations can be maintained . #% Across the European Union we hear of young people not wanting to farm . #% Unfortunately it is another incident in the ongoing saga of accessing Strasbourg . #% What then if pandemic disease outbreaks , already ravishing Brazil in terms of foot-and-mouth , spread throughout that continent ? #% Why do Tibetans try to escape from China ? #% As we have seen , ideas that fit one part of Europe will not work in another part . #% I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters . #% However it is with some concern that I see that they have changed the common position in particular . #% Madam President , if we are ill , health is our most desired object . #% These things are necessary , but they should not be the picture that is presented to the people of Europe . #% Some people condemn globalisation , but if there is one good thing about globalisation it means that the world becomes interdependent and we have at least some pressure we can apply . #% With regard to the situation of whether or not the people want Europe or Europe , I would never dare to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe . #% It can be said that , had the process not been in place , up to 1000 further deaths could have occurred in that period in Northern Ireland . #% The Commission 's reform proposal does not contain any contingency plans for unexpected economic and social restructuring in the regions . #% I see that the Commissioner responsible , Mr Busquin , is in the Chamber . #% Has there been some change in the status of the language ? #% We must have an early-warning system in place to pinpoint areas of potential disagreement at the earliest possible moment . #% You say it is not for the Council to monitor but who is monitoring it ? #% But that is going to be the case if we do not realise what the problem is and how to address it . #% It does not give us the right to harvest forests in Finland or Sweden . #% Knowing all this , why would President Bush take this irrational decision ? #% In these three strands we are talking of the inclusion of what was excluded which is a major focus of democracy in the European Union . #% Mr Belder is absolutely right , however , to say that the programme is currently inefficient , ineffective and certainly lacks a solid legal base . #% If we have a fixed figure that the European Union needs as own resources , then obviously if we leave the Member States more of what we call the traditional own resources , we have to collect more of that as a percentage of GNP . #% Madam President , I wonder why the honourable Member did not find the Liberal Group photogenic . #% None of us have any problems in supporting the points he made and we hope very much that the effectiveness of voluntary regulation will be demonstrated as soon as we get the first report . #% The attention that we must pay to buildings but are not yet paying is a crucial aspect of these reports and I recommend the practical effects of those to all of us . #% So the rate of change and the types of change which will take place in the future will be even greater and more vast and our capacity as human beings to cope with that change will be determined by the skills , knowledge and training that we are given in the interim period . #% It is estimated that up to 400 000 people have been killed and more than two and a half million people displaced or made homeless in the last three years due to conflict . #% Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commission , the European Union leaders when they met in Nice last December to review existing treaties had one single objective in mind : they sought to change the internal decision-making procedures within the institutions of the Union to guarantee that enlargement of the European Union could take place . #% Commissioner , without seeking to be unkind , is it not fair to say that the Commission 's record on cutting red tape has been very high on promise , but very low on delivery ? #% Here I am referring especially to the increases allowed in intervention quantities for 1996/97 . #% 
The Treaty is certainly a good deal for countries of Central and Eastern Europe , but equally for existing Member States of the Union . #% In conclusion , let me , along with other Members of this House , wish you , all members of Parliament staff , the Commissioner , all members of Commission staff , and all who serve this Parliament a very happy and peaceful Christmas and a prosperous New Year . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very objective report . #% It is also correct in asserting that the issue of the budget threshold is a delicate one , and must take into account global costs . #% Secondly , what should be our approach to this kind of material arriving from outside the Community ? #% There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people , which is unacceptable . #% Some # 30 million has been provided for this scheme , which I hope will shortly be approved by the Commission . #% As regards principle number two , institutions , a proportional assembly and a proportional government will involve all sections of society . #% . I should just like to respond very briefly to Mr Pannella . #% Since the Amsterdam Treaty came into force on 1 May , the codecision procedure , which involves a very close relationship between Parliament , the Commission and the Council , now covers a wide range of policies including those in the transport sector , regional affairs , social matters , employment initiatives , structural funding , consumer protection , public health and environmental concerns . #% I therefore ask the Commission to look at the crux of this debate : how do we get good patent law which rewards our most innovative companies for their investment in R&D while , at the same time , not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant position , lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition ? #% in writing . - I support this report which focuses on the various aspects of direct and indirect discrimination towards women and men who are responsible for taking care of dependents . #% I would seek an assurance that the Commission will enquire into this and ask the Chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment . #% I thank the European Parliament and the Commission for their support in this regard . #% We must take action against these people to make sure that it does not happen and to restore consumer confidence . #% However , I find it extraordinary that in at least one Member State , Cohesion Fund investment in one region has caused major problems in another . #% It has to add to the existing safety requirements of the IEA , therefore it is a nonsense . #% So , in order to clarify all this , let us not take a third outside organization into this , namely the Nicole Pery ad hoc committee , because I was a member of that working party and on this particular matter it did not do anything of that nature . #% I have now been informed that the Council will not deal with my question or ten other Members ' questions because it claims it has not had time to prepare its replies . #% I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on his report . #% I am glad to say that the Irish presidency intends to make this a priority in its forthcoming term . #% In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by the use of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy , by the use the power or strength of energy to try and make people kneel before the influence of the Russian Government , and , most importantly of all , by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes . #% To use a slang word it is a ` cop-out ' to say that it is not a matter for the Council . #% But we can only work by virtue of the people who come to us with problems and address them and their particular needs . #% The consequences of the disaster are still being felt in Spain , Portugal and France . #% In relation to ongoing legal action , I can not understand who the Commission is trying to protect . #% Nevertheless , we will need this information so that we are able to extend some sort of assistance on a reasonable basis to the new countries of the Union where food production and agricultural production will increase by 50 per cent what we have in the Union today . #% To do otherwise would be to fail in providing security for its citizens and that must be the prime concern of any government . #% However , on a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue with regard to , in particular , Erasmus students who have been treated differently in different Member States . #% Let us be clear that we are not matching our words with deeds . #% Our present growth rate at 11 % is over three times the average of other Member States . #% In this respect it is important that the use of aborted foetal tissue be excluded . #% Not only are we unwilling to risk upsetting a good business market for the sake of bringing injustice in Gaza to an end , but we are also unwilling so far to dissolve or even just suspend the EU-Israel agreement . #% On the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz , it is very important that we remember and honour the Jewish victims and the other national victims , like the Poles , Russians etc. , who died in Auschwitz . #% We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved , because of the reduction in stocks , because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons . #% I am very happy to support this report . #% Yes , Mr Prodi , we need `` ambitious reforms of the European Union institutions '' . #% I want to thank you and all the Members and say what a pleasure it was to work here in this Parliament over the last five years . #% I am also concerned at the grandstanding by some Member States , which are resisting the budgetary commitments needed for the successful development of the accession countries ' economies . #% The same arrangements in 1996 will ensure the continuation of at least an orderly fishery and the tuna fishery is now one of the most closely monitored fisheries in EU waters . #% We have to know what the cost and effect , the damage or the benefit will be to those who fly , be it as a hobby , on business or for any other reason . #% The issue is one of particular importance to Ireland , as it is the only island state in the Union and relies heavily on the availability of low cost airfares . #% Ireland could not countenance any suggestion of harmonising corporate tax rates , especially in this period of economic slow-down . #% We have not succeeded in establishing a socially just situation . #% Each EU country , with the wholehearted support of this Parliament , should have legislation to ensure that , when child abusers return from their travels , they can have the full rigour of the law applied to them in their country of origin . #% This is an important contribution to transparency and accountability . #% I should like to remind the Commission that while we are very willing to have discussions with you on the perfomance reserve , we do not have the right of initiative . #% It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty . #% We are not happy , as you said in your introduction , in relation to the agreement with Equatorial Guinea . #% Can I recall to the House that yesterday 's annual guidelines issued by the Commission urge Member States to avoid using state aids to postpone essential restructuring . #% But an even greater marvel is that he has three such great , large , heavy hats and only one head to wear them on . #% I hope that is not the case here . #% Wherever the last speaker conjured up his figures , he certainly did not conjure them up from the published Commission figures . #% You are destroying our services and the living standards of our people . #% However , on the basis of the oral amendment , as rapporteur I can accept the overall amendment . #% We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban . #% This is the toughest resolution that we have seen on Darfur , but it is action that is needed . #% It is not enough to contain terrorism , although I have no doubt of the power of our states to do so . #% Their failure to give themselves up for justice endangers the reputation of Sinn Féin and of its leadership . #% Now , with avian influenza , they are recognising the hallmarks of such a virus . #% This is the biggest test so far of the 21st century . #% I wish to address the issue of the technicalities . #% In conclusion , the CAP reform proposals are unacceptable to Ireland because they are not balanced , they do not protect the interests of Irish farming and they do not enhance rural development . #% If the European Union as a political entity is to grow and prosper , we must ensure that its schoolchildren are given opportunities to learn different languages , to experience the education systems of other countries within the European Union . #% The Commission , instead of submitting a proposal to Parliament and discussing with Parliament how to overcome this problem , referred the matter to the quango of unelected , unrepresentative officials from Member State governments , to make a decision in secret and not refer it back to Parliament . #% For example , the strong economic growth in the east coast region of my country is not necessarily reflected throughout all parts of the country , and the existence of uneven growth rates within a country and a region should be taken into account by the Commission . #% 
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen ' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared . #% Most Member States question the Commission 's approach in making substantial reduction commitment offers at this stage , given that there will be pressure to make further concessions as negotiations proceed . #% I also welcome this report by Mr Chanterie . #% Ireland 's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration . #% If the intention of using contract workers is that the monitoring , which must be long-term monitoring , does not need to take place , this is unacceptable . #% Finally , again I say to the UK presidency : keep up the good work , two weeks left and remember the last hurdle is also an important one to negotiate before you successfully make the finishing line which I am sure you will . #% Would the Commissioner agree with this particular statement ? #% I am wondering if there is any further action . #% Half the population of Gaza is under 25 years of age and there is 60 % unemployment in the area . #% If we are well , it is hopefully one of our most valued . #% Subsidiarity and decentralization must be the cornerstone of our future policies to ensure that our regional policies are relevant to the needs and interests of local communities . #% This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage . #% Mrs Thatcher has sought through her disgraceful intervention to make this issue a political football in the United Kingdom . #% Mr President , as has already been said a number of times , the Irish `` no '' was not a `` no '' to enlargement . #% Would it now be prudent to establish a central European register for suicide cases so that an EU-wide analysis of data could take place ? #% I also wish to compliment Mr Trakatellis on his contribution in this report . #% We should not have to wait for the United Nations in New York to give us the go-ahead on this issue . #% I want to see real responsibility , and not a minimal consultation because if that is what we end up with it will not work . #% We in the European Parliament should be involved in encouraging a wide and open debate as a prelude to a full institutional participation après-Laeken . #% This is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind . #% But it is easy to see that the arms industry as a whole is pushing the policy . #% Commissioner Solbes and all my Spanish colleagues have my heartfelt sympathy . #% There are people in Europe killing each other because of differences over religion , ethnicity and nationality , there are people going to bed hungry , there are people sleeping outdoors and there are people without adequate health care . #% The issue here is whether another 120 should be allowed into this very biologically sensitive area , not just the 40 that are there , but three or four times as many . #% During this extension of PEACE Funding I am looking for an overt righting of these wrongs . #% in writing . - I support this report on the EU 's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( ECHR ) , as provided by the Lisbon Treaty . #% Turkey 's position today should not be seen as a rejection by the European Union in any shape or form . #% Last night in Parliament we had a discussion with Commissioner Oreja on comitology , the proposal coming from the Commission . #% It is also a disaster for the young men and women forced to join and fight there in the armies of NATO and the United States , of whom perhaps 500 have already been killed this year . #% Will you take any steps on the action plan for energy efficiency ? #% I hope that he can ensure that any new Treaty will provide the legal framework needed successfully to fight organized crime and the drug trade . #% That is why we set the target between Parliament , Commission and Council of spending 20 % of the basic spending on education and health . #% What it wants is access at high prices , because that is the only way that it can grow and prosper . #% I am fundamentally opposed to any kind of European army or European police force or to a European defence identity within the EU . #% We are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people . #% This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning and is committed to a universal ban on human cloning . #% It is in all our interests that the objective of making Europe the world 's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 be achieved . #% What we are asking for in Parliament here , in the second reading of the Trakatellis , report is a continuation of that relationship with the European citizen , a continuation of the confidence that the European citizens have in us to deliver for them in real terms . #% I want to make it very clear . #% That is something we should note at this stage because full democratic participation is vital . #% Good company law and good corporate governance are essential to the job security of all employees and to the protect the future of members of company pension schemes . #% In relation to the other Treaty provisions , the suggestion has been put forward very strongly that we should incorporate in the Treaty specific references to children and their rights as citizens . #% That is not necessarily a bad thing , because it clearly indicates that the citizens see the Ombudsman 's office as a port of call for problems they have with European institutions . #% It is quite clear that this form of punishment is not a deterrent to crime . #% He has also , for many countries who do not have a tradition of Ombudsman , brought the role closer and explained it to the people - which was very important . #% The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that . #% The decision as to whether to contribute monies to the funds we need to implement these important measures rests with them . #% When we come to vote on this report tomorrow , we will support the candidature of the 11 candidate states . #% The bottom line with regard to the reconstruction of Iran from an EU perspective is the following : it is going to take months and years to reconstruct the city and help to rebuild the lives of thousands of people which have simply been destroyed by this horrific earthquake . #% People in Ireland have the opportunity to stop this by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty . #% As I have stated here on previous occasions , this crisis is having a greater impact on Irish beef producers and on the Irish economy than any other Member State . #% In relation to Cambodia , the motion calls on the authorities to engage in political and institutional reforms , to release political prisoners , to combat corruption , deforestation and displacement of people and to take measures to combat the sex tourism industry . #% Could I plead with the Commission , the Council and indeed the summit to be sure that decision is respected in what they say and in the signals they give . #% Hopefully that will result in the justice that is clearly the right of stable couples , whether they be homosexual or heterosexual . #% As we help them , we must record their stories , to begin the process of gathering evidence for targeted attacks and possible war crimes . #% It also has a role in transposition and implementation . #% We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries can not . #% It was announced as a letter even on the agenda of the Civil Liberties Committee on the day of adoption and no deadline was fixed for amendments . #% Let our Member State governments get their act together in dealing with those children . #% in writing . - The Small Business Act has been one of the most proactive acts of the past three years , and it is important that the EU continues to focus on SMEs . #% And if Irish farmers were to follow the letter of the directive and spread slurry when allowed , they would cause pollution rather than prevent it . #% That is the civilized conduct of statesmanship , it is the civilized conduct of diplomacy and it is the civilized conduct of politics . #% This will actually encourage more animal testing . #% The activities of nuclear power stations and reprocessing plants have implications that go beyond borders . #% In particular , we must defend the advances we have made in the constitution on this matter . #% EU alleges Israel was spy . ' #% 
This concession should be taken off the table in a short period of time if there is no reciprocal response on non-agricultural market access and on services . #% So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion . #% Equatorial Guinea is notorious in relation to that and you did not address the question . #% We will have to supervent Hilal and those like him . #% The eastern European countries are being misled by those EU leaders who maintain that the `` no '' vote in Ireland was a `` no '' to enlargement . #% This is in sharp contrast with American policy . #% Effectively what we are voting for is something which will not , in fact , be the law after Ecofin has made its changes . #% They have a very healthy respect for the European Union but they disagree fundamentally with the way the common agricultural policy operates with regard to all the areas mentioned in relation to food and also in relation to fisheries . #% What they are doing is reducing the rate of increase and we should underline that . #% Unfortunately these hopes were to be cruelly shattered and it is hard to forget that the present Intifada arose directly from the unnecessary and provocative visit by Mr Sharon to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem . #% Otherwise , all research money , all researchers , all the top graduates at doctorate level will move to the US , Japan or elsewhere , because that is where their ideas can be protected and there is bigger investment . #% Secondly , as the President-in-Office is so much in favour of the idea of concerted effort and concerted action at European level , could we have a commitment from the President-in-Office that the monies which are presently in a bank account in Brussels and are to be allocated to the Irish naval service for the upgrading of equipment and for the provision of extra ships be released as soon as possible to enable the Irish naval service , which in effect is the western wing of any European coastguard service , to protect that large area against the illegal importation of drugs . #% Finally , I support and commend your approach towards promoting external affairs . #% I deplore the decision of the EPP , ELDR and the UEN to vote against the PES resolution to set up a European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change . #% But if Mr Primakov and his administration do that we can help each other out of the present crisis . #% I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the two rapporteurs despite the fact that I do not agree with everything that they have set down and suggested . #% Within the European Union these issues will continue to be raised and progress will be made . #% Mr President , what has been proposed here is a very dangerous situation in which immigrants and asylum seekers are being treated like criminals in that they are to be fingerprinted . #% That has got us into difficulties on this issue . #% However , the conditions and events which surrounded the recent World Summit on the Information Society have significantly increased existing concerns relating to human rights and freedom of expression in Tunisia . #% The mission of democracies must be to defeat terrorism , not merely to contain or to tame it . #% As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament . #% One just has to look , for example , at the negotiations over cod and other TACs during the December meeting to see that there is no political will there . #% One of the issues that must be addressed if we are to ensure that women - and in particular working women - can participate and that they get time off work in order to pursue trade union activities , is that of employers being extremely reluctant to allow workers to have time off to pursue either training or trade union activities . #% I must also say - and , again , I disagree with my colleague - that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required . #% I did vote in favour of the motion for a resolution , as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is raised many times . #% Under strict interpretation of the decision which the minister referred to , they would then be entitled to sell duty-free goods on the boat at that particular time . #% However , before I do that , let me just say a few words about the EU budget talks that are ongoing for 2007 onwards . #% Hamas rocket attacks on Israel have provoked the response it desired - counter-attacks and the loss of civilian life and a further entrenchment of positions . #% To the extent that we are the custodians of the public interest in such a crucial area , we must act with extreme care and reflect and respect the views of our citizens . #% Since there is no real future for the reprocessing of nuclear waste , Commissioner , do you not agree that it is time , and that there is justification , for the closing-down of Sellafield ? #% The challenge to achieve cohesion will be greater : we have an unprecedented expansion of the Union and we still have poor regions . #% Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill , maim , abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims . #% Ten days of limited , focused , proportionate bombardment stopped the aggression then . #% Also , it is fundamental that , under the guise of better lawmaking , alternatives to legislation be examined . #% Producers , traders and the entire agri-food business have felt the effect . #% The Celtic Tiger , for which you claim credit in Ireland , has given us 150 000 children living in poverty in Ireland . #% The vet is in the front line of surveillance for indigenous and exotic diseases . #% For road transport we will now have three categories of operators , own-account , third party hauliers and self-employed with three different working time regimes under Directive 93/104 . #% In supporting totally Mr Evans ' report , I would like to make a couple of comments . #% Do you apply the rule that a person is innocent until proven guilty - which exists in the common law system - or do you apply another legal basis which exists in other Member States of the Union ? #% The ethnic rivalry between the Hausa and the Berom people must also be recognised as a factor in the violence . #% Can I comment on what Mr Lyon just said ? #% Farmers ' privilege is explicitly protected for reseeding and breeding animals on their own land , as is the case today . #% The most effective way to achieve European goals in relation to sustainable development and environmental policies is through full cooperation across all Member States . #% Climate change is a serious global threat . #% I believe that those countries which are currently net beneficiaries from the funds will have great difficulty in accepting such a proposal in March . #% Climate change policies thus need to be designed to contribute to economic growth in the developing countries . #% We know now that the election results were so close that the opposition must be given a role in government to reflect the massive popular support they now hold . #% You then closed the vote before we had an opportunity to correct our own votes . #% In conclusion , the future for our single market must lie in a car taxation system which is visibly CO2 modulated , but without central prescription . #% How often have we said in this House that the growth of SMEs is the key to fighting unemployment in the EU and indeed in our regional policy programmes we have strengthened our support for SMEs in recognition of this potential . #% Equally , sponsorship by tobacco companies of events or activities involving several Member States will be outlawed . #% in writing . - How is this still going on ? #% Firstly , Schengen is not a treaty-based agreement . #% This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition ; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace . #% I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition , in particular beef and butter . #% Madam President , it being the last day of the pre-Christmas season , Mr Evans will be happy to hear that we are totally in agreement with him . #% Madam President , under our Constitution , the Irish ratification process requires a referendum on all Treaty revisions . #% Therefore , we should look for some flexibility on export quotas . #% The present Commission has now acted responsibly and satisfactorily on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry . #% I know that many organizations in Ireland fighting on these issues would definitely welcome this step . #% You will find that we will respond generously and effectively and helpfully . #% Dismissing Parliament 's concerns of will not work , Commissioner De Gucht , and I would urge you to consult us more if you wish to have any potential agreement signed off by Parliament . #% This was unfortunate , not because it was not necessary , but because we should not the EU find ourselves in such a position that simply feeds euro-scepticism in Europe , particularly in the country which is so reprimanded . #% Could the Commissioner indicate in what way we can hope to measure the success of the ILO and the European Union 's efforts in this area ? #% 
I have some reservations in the context of the negotiations in the IGC . #% I also think that the very fact that this initiative is being suggested is an explicit recognition that we have failed so far in our journey towards equality . #% Think of what that could do in the developing world . #% It was asked how we can compensate the developing world for having taken their best . #% Also , in relation to the continued cycle , the idea of a period of rest on a journey that can continue indefinitely is completely unacceptable . #% Would it like more information about this study ? #% Madam President , as you know I am a very enthusiastic anti-smoker . #% But the bottom line is that the US and British forces are simply unable to cope with what is a rapidly deteriorating security situation . #% What about the method of disposal - have we reached any scientific conclusions about the necessity for incineration as against the safe burial of dead animals ? #% You even went so far as to ask us for our opinion on different issues . #% Finally , we should never underestimate the role of individual responsibility . #% Within the European Union an environmental impact assessment must be carried out on the construction of new roads , water and sewage facilities and large infrastructure projects . #% Moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply . #% I should also like to thank the people in the Commission responsible . #% Yet who could have foreseen that in the second half of that century those same people would come together in the European Union . #% The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules , and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like . #% If the Treaty of Nice is not ratified by all 15 Member States , enlargement will undoubtedly be delayed . #% Madam President , I was in Uganda in January when some of the abducted little girls who were put into the army by the LRA were released . #% This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one . #% This happens for a variety of reasons , not least because they are the ones who give birth . #% Some are not even designed with those who are in real need in mind . #% The Commission has supported Turkish NGOs and professional organizations promoting human rights for a number of years , including the Human Rights Association , the Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Medical Association . #% We should use these negotiations as a means of leverage to ensure that China not only listens to EU concerns about its continued abuse of human rights but that it also takes action to improve its record . #% If people think owners do not influence newspapers think again . #% There is state-sponsored terrorism and terrorism of war and retribution , as we are witnessing in the Middle East . #% As regards torture weapons , we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them . #% I want to recognize the efforts of Karl von Wogau , his committee and , indeed , this Parliament for their dedication to this project over the years . #% We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict . #% Mr President , I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this historic debate . #% One concerns the Middle East . #% In whose interest was it to depart in this piece of fast-track legislation from tried-and-tested procedures and the practice of using objective performance criteria for environmental standards ? #% It was an honour for my party to be given the rapporteurship . #% Mr President , I support the enlargement of the European Union because I know it will consolidate the new democracies in eastern and central Europe . #% As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter . #% We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out , and then Aer Lingus , which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland . #% I believe that it is inappropriate to upgrade relations with Israel until such time as it displays concerted efforts to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian residents and engages in sustained political dialogue to reach a two-state solution to the region 's problems . #% It is good to remember that Europe has shared a common position throughout its history regarding the importance of supporting and protecting family and marriage . #% By stating explicitly now what we feel the common average should be we allow the Council to say : that is too high . #% It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate . #% Today in the budget vote we rejected three amendments that would have removed EU development funding from government and organisational programmes that included coercive abortion , involuntary sterilisation and infanticide . #% In fact , there is strong evidence to suggest that it has assisted and sponsored attacks on refugee camps . #% Mr President , one thing that has not been mentioned during this debate is the fisheries protocol which has been attached to this agreement . #% The Commission needs to ensure legal security in information and communication technologies so as to protect consumers and innovative creators . #% Any attempt by Israel to expel him from the Occupied Territories will only undermine the Palestinian Authority and will further inflame the security situation . #% The legal bases proposed are longstanding and not innovative in themselves . #% Some believe that this directive did not go far enough in this direction and that there is no real genuine consultation of the workforce . #% The impossibility of distinguishing these proteins and bone spicules , which do not pose a TSE risk from proteins of ruminant origin which could contain BSE-carrying prions , resulted in a number of high-profile , extremely costly , wasteful and unnecessary withdrawals from shipments and , more controversially , beet-based animal feed , owing to this harmless and unavoidable adventitious presence of non-ruminant proteins . #% Pre-commercial procurement is a specific approach for the public sector to engage R&D , with a view to driving innovation to ensure sustainable high quality public services in Europe . #% The Governing Council does not appear to command the support of the Iraqi people . #% We are also all aware of the environmental proofing of EU regulations and directives which is now constantly taking place . #% Mr President , I want to offer my warmest welcome to Chancellor Schroeder who is here on behalf of the German presidency . #% Another wearisome debate dominated by the slow-learning fanatics of a failed and rejected Constitution . #% This , I feel , was appropriate in these times of crisis when ordinary workers are suffering huge pain with cutbacks . #% Unilateral action by the US and UK Governments endangers world peace , regional stability and undermines the authority of the United Nations . #% What is happening in terms of Commission proposals on different legal bases and the Council subsequently changing or amending them or , in many cases , introducing a dual legal base ? #% But seen from an Irish perspective , this stands logic on its head , we have counties Antrim , Down , Louth , Dublin , Wicklow and Wexford where the vast majority of the population of the island of Ireland , about 2 million people , live on or adjacent to the Irish sea where the majority of British nuclear institutions are sited . #% As a result of this new initiative , all European Union Member States will establish formal incident-reporting systems to facilitate the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies involving aeroplanes in Europe . #% I believe that we should include in the discussion not only purely budgetary matters but also the many additional factors which are also relevant to Agenda 2000 and the process of enlargement . #% We have had the Tampere Summit . #% There was a recent case in Ireland in relation to Pandora , which said it did not want to transport live animals any more , presumably for economic reasons . #% However concerns raised by industry regarding the possibility that public expectations may be raised prematurely with regard to some products and commercial sensitivity of information are also valid . #% I do not have a piece of paper which tells me so , but there are various conventions and laws and international rights which exist and which protect me as a citizen of the world . #% I would add my voice to others ' condemnations . #% I urge the Iraqi regime to change course and allow UN inspectors to be readmitted to Iraq now . #% I can not accept the promotion of equal matrimonial and other rights for same sex couples . #% 
Third , in the area of security and defence , it is important that no new obligations are imposed on Ireland which threaten our traditional policy of military neutrality . #% My colleague , Mrs Scallon is not here because we understood President Nicole Fontaine to say at the end of the beef debate that the Smet and Hughes reports would be taken tomorrow . #% ` Stupid ' energy would use electricity and gas to heat the air outside buildings rather than insulating the buildings . #% The Commission must implement all the recommendations in our report and this must be done efficiently and immediately . #% I support the framework programme being brought forward by the European Commission to combat the traffic in human beings by developing effective cooperation across the European Union in judicial procedures in this regard , and also by establishing closer links with the accession countries . #% The majority of consumers no longer use travel packages if they have found cheaper methods to go on holiday and see the world . #% We know , and we have heard here this evening , that many thousands of our citizens suffer from this disease and related syndrome throughout the European Union . #% How do we deal with the contradiction between the different articles in the Treaty ? #% Strong fluorinated greenhouse gases legislation is long overdue to rectify the past and protect our climate into the future . #% Mr President , rather than reinvent the wheel and go back over everything that was said , it is important to look at the reality : our population is getting older , living longer and retiring sooner . #% Is politics really the art of the possible or have we lost sight of the core values of the society that we purport to represent ? #% I am a great supporter of President Barroso 's plan with regard to the necessity for Europe to take the lead and take the leap from the 20th century into the 22nd century with regard to what we need to do for research and development and investment in technology . #% Commissioner , I received your letter today after your visit to Ireland , but the last point you raised , which your letter failed to address , relates to the lack of resources in the Legal Unit of the Environment Directorate to deal with complaints . #% We need , for instance , to increase the size of the Drugs Squad . #% Member States have been attentive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and have taken the most important aspects of our recommendations on board . #% The Secretary-General of the Hague Convention , Mr Duncan , will be absolutely delighted at the speed , efficiency and care with which Mrs Hermange has brought her report to us . #% If those advocating change within the Iranian regime need help and support through debates and discussions with people like us , why are not we giving them that ? #% I asked if the Commission was planning to review current priority or non-priority road projects within the trans-European networks framework so as to give preference to more sustainable transport modes . #% The essence of the best idea and the best debate is when you have divergent opinions , coming together to try and garner the best from the situation . #% I regret it if there are people in Northern Ireland who have a feeling that one community has benefited more than the other or that the transparency that should be there is not there . #% Mr President , sometimes it is important to explore the background to a situation . #% There is clearly a very serious problem , and Aung San Suu Kyi should be released immediately . #% The only response that the European Union and its Member States can make to this and to the current attempts by the United States to generate a war psychology in relation to Iraq is to stand together . #% This sends out a very bad signal . #% I hope that will be supported . #% Evaluating biotechnology is not the same as evaluating the ethical implications of patent applications . #% This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session . #% So how can we be sure of the current capacity of the Latvian fleet and that these transfers will not lead to an increase and more overfishing ? #% Yet , as Mr Tindemans says , the Amsterdam Treaty makes a common defence policy a more credible prospect given that it strengthens the organic bond between the European Union and the Western European Union , created by Maastricht . #% We are trying very hard to change his mind on this issue with a very important report going to the ECOFIN ministers , which has just been completed by the Commission . #% On the Armenian issue , I believe that it should be mentioned in the report , but it should not be introduced as a new precondition for membership , as we should remain committed to the original criteria if we are to stay credible . #% We are shortly going to cross the final hurdles so as to bring about the accession of 10 new Member States to the Union . #% It is that there are 42 million people in the world today suffering from the AIDS virus , yet we have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such this . #% Farmers need to wake up and stop opposing environmental legislation , such as the nitrates directive , and realise that these laws could protect them against the WTO . #% This is a voluntary scheme , but if firms genuinely want to improve their environmental policy and their environmental performance then any encouragement in that direction should be welcomed . #% Let us act now and keep energy security at the top of the political agenda in peacetime . #% I think it is fair , balanced and comprehensive . #% With both BSE and foot-and-mouth farmers by and large are innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% Unfortunately , I have to say that most of the saints are gone . #% If we get it right , we can open up the market , boost jobs and growth across the EU and help Europe compete globally with the booming services market in India and China . #% For example , in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked , his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike . #% It has been described as a ghost town ; it is desolate , isolated and empty . #% Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel , but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry , restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance . #% Like others , I urge the Council to fast-track the statute so that we , as MEPs , can fight our next election under the politics of Europe and not the politics of expenses . #% We have worked hard to get legal certainty and there is a clear process for updating and supplementing prospectuses . #% It is hard to believe ten years after the Chernobyl disaster which , as has already been said , left 125 , 000 dead and a further 3.5 million ill , that the plant in the Ukraine is still open even though it only produces about 6 % of the electricity there . #% Many of our policies affect children 's rights and interests but this week Commissioner Prodi said he did not feel it was necessary to have a dedicated unit looking at children 's rights within the Community . #% Having said that I support the thrust of what is before us here today and the ability of the Commission to use as a carrot-and-stick approach the Structural Funds to encourage in perhaps the most effective way recalcitrant Member States such as Ireland , to get their house in order in relation to the Natura 2000 sites . #% We do not have the time to go into that . #% May it be particularly infectious in our country of Ireland as we endeavour to awaken from their slumber , from their indifference the 65 % of the Irish electorate who failed to turn out to vote for the Nice Treaty last June , as we yet again try to offer them the opportunity to endorse enlargement of Europe between now and the end of December this year . #% The extent of the damage caused by speculation in the financial sector highlights the importance of preventive measures such as taxation of financial transactions and warrants considering compensation from the sector for the costs of the crisis . #% The car industry itself admits - and none of us can be happy about this - that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years . #% in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the commitment made by the G20 to work on a financial transaction tax . #% Without adequate funding for LIFE + , the positive steps to address these problems since the introduction of the current programme in 1992 will be reversed . #% Finally , fundamental respect for human rights and freedoms must be at the core of all our work in this area . #% Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967 , after the start of the Six-Day War , it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a two-state solution . #% The same applies to trains or trucks . #% His insult to our honoured police dead and to our honoured police maimed is something we will not tolerate . #% I firmly believe that Yasser Arafat is the political leader that the Israeli government must be negotiating with at this time , and that seeking to topple the Palestinian Authority is a recipe for long-term instability and will only intensify the hatreds between the Palestinian and Israeli people as well as between Israelis and other Arab countries in the Middle East . #% In conclusion , I will be supporting Mrs Smet 's report on the basis that the procedure does not seek to harmonise policies or converge policies , but facilitates compatibility , facilitates flexibility and encourages dissemination of best practices and exchanges of ideas . #% The EU has formal ties with all three countries , with cooperation agreements on Cambodia and Laos in 1997 and Vietnam in 1995 . #% I know that we have sent out a tender for an international management team , but we are fiddling while Rome burns . #% I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken on board the amendment drafted by Mr Crowley and myself . #% Would it be possible to take a split vote on recital E ? #% We must always remember that the diversity of Europe is its greatest strength . #% Only seven per cent of the EU 's farmers are under 35 years of age - this is a stark reminder that we need to ensure that the conditions exist to keep young people farming . #% 
However , I have some differences of opinion with regard to some of the speeches and comments . #% Obviously , many finance ministers did not support real negotiation . #% We recognise that within the current constraints Professor Prodi is taking some steps to improve the dreadful situation of the past , but we may need Professor Prodi to take some more steps . #% This is not only an environmental issue and it is not just an economic issue , but also an issue of international social justice . #% In the context of being your own man it is also correct that you should consider getting your project right rather than getting it early . #% I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report . #% In a word , agriculture in Ireland is a vital national interest . #% So it is very timely that we should now lay down a marker in this Parliament , because there is no point in doing this in November , or indeed December , when everybody will be aware of the very serious situation . #% To take account of this , I have added a clarification to include transit whenever importation is mentioned in the Directive . #% Perhaps here we see the long arm of Mr Blair , but the falsification of such data is of concern to Europe . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , President Prodi , firstly , I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you , Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms . #% Nearly ten million Europeans suffer today from dementia , with Alzheimer 's the most common form . #% If EU Member States fishing in Guinea do not provide reliable and detailed data on what they catch , Parliament wants the Commission to begin legal proceedings against them and even to revoke their right to fish under the agreement . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Commissioner and to thank the rapporteur for his report . #% Having congratulated the Irish presidency , I should also like to extend my congratulations to the commitment and professionalism of the Irish civil service and the diplomatic corps , without whose support it would not have been possible to make progress . #% Happily now we can discuss them . #% European electricity and gas networks constitute key pieces of strategic infrastructure . #% I would like to know from the Commission why it considers this undesirable now , after almost twenty years ? #% One of the central elements of this investment relates to ensuring that new broadband facilities are available at every opportunity . #% The directive on misleading and comparative advertising ( 2006/114/EC ) , which applies to business-to-business transactions , is insufficient in providing an effective remedy and is also inadequately enforced by Member States . #% If a consumer decides to avoid such products , that is his or her right . #% Belgium has signed , but has not ratified the Treaty . #% Recent events have established , through the work of this House , the need to establish ethical and normative rules for the conduct of European affairs . #% Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies ? #% In consumerism we are taught to be selfish . #% I am pleased that our socialist amendment calling for a parliamentary assembly was taken up world-wide . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office , finally , if he and his Council recognise the outcome of democratic elections within this Union ? #% On the other hand , removal of the derogation would impose unnecessary administrative burdens and costs in these Member States without bringing any visible benefits to anyone concerned . #% I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the report . #% This is a practical example of how Article 13 can be translated into action . #% Beware of the various menus on decoupling ! #% Now that the Summit is over , the vital work of ensuring sustainable development has to continue . #% It seems to me that this is a matter of concern not just to people in Ireland but to people everywhere in Europe . #% This REACH regulation aims to maintain a strong chemicals industry within the internal market , while providing a high level of protection for human health and the environment . #% However , given the fact that the matter has been raised here in the House and has been raised with various Ministers in their Member States by a number of organizations , I think this is a matter which is worth re-examining . #% In addition , it is crucial that Member States are allowed the necessary discretion and flexibility to decide for themselves their own goals and political measures , while reaching broad Community targets . #% Capitulating to China was both immoral and cowardly . #% Bypassing the Treaty with secondary legislation such as the amendments to this regulation makes a mockery of the idea that it is the victim of infringements of the law rather than interested observers -- whose motivation and support base may not always be clear -- who should be able to seek a remedy . #% in writing . - I supported the Maňka Report on the European Parliament amending budget while conscious of the sensitivity of increasing budgets at a time when citizens are being asked to take pay cuts and jobs are being lost . #% There is no great difference between the expressed sympathies of the Members and the response of the presidency . #% I will ask for a report on the effects of Rohypnol in the United States . #% It is an important initiative and we should encourage not only the rail industry but also other sectors of industry to adopt this kind of social partner agreement on working conditions for employees . #% I can well understand the sentiments which he expresses . #% I do not want to be told that I can not take fibre , garlic , cranberry juice or folic acid , if I happen to be pregnant . #% He had been instrumental in persuading some of the rebel groups to give up their armed struggle and had helped to secure the release of hostages last June . #% I wish to apologize unreservedly to all Members for any personal insult they may have felt . #% Beyond the work we are doing today , there is no doubt that Equitable has left a sour taste for the losers and others who are watching events unfolding and it does nothing to help those who are trying to encourage citizens to invest in pensions . #% It is specifically targeted at job creation , education , training , environmental improvement and state management training because the living conditions of people can actually add to their handicap . #% As a fallback position , I support the proposal put forward by the PPEDE Group and others at committee stage and now resubmitted by the ALDE , namely to decouple Article 4 by requiring a study into the scientific basis of nutrient profiles before making a decision on their implementation . #% Disabled people of all nationalities were exterminated for the simple reason that they were disabled . #% In conclusion , I want to emphasize what is said in paragraph 30 of the resolution : all those who have to take decisions which may affect the safety or well-being of children must exercise the greatest possible care and take the maximum precautions to safeguard and protect the interests of children . #% It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure a coherent strategy against organised crime . #% On my own behalf and that of the ALDE Group , I warmly welcome the sisters and partner of Mr McCartney to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today . #% During this debate it has at times been difficult to distinguish heat from light . #% Perhaps if Mrs Jackson comes in there will be time for her to ask a supplementary because the two are on the same issue . #% However , I can speak on behalf of the people in my constituency in the south-west of Ireland , whom I met last weekend . #% But would the President-in-Office share my concerns that growth rates do not appear to be converting into forecasted increases in employment rates ? #% Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-stop re-run of the Delors White Paper . #% When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union , a common approach is needed at EU level . #% Mr President , on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland , who have known the cruelties of terrorism for more than a generation , I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy to the parents and people of Beslan . #% My reason for abstaining in the final vote on this report is two-fold . #% Is it yours ? #% It will hopefully be made public very soon , but the reality is that Sellafield and Cap de la Hague were a risk even before 11 September 2001 ; the chemical plants in our midst were a risk even before Toulouse . #% I would ask the Commission to further elaborate on its proposals , as requested in the Hatzidakis report on state aid . #% In conclusion , we have listed the problems , but what are the causes ? #% 
We can expect an exponential increase as China , India and many other rapidly developing economies increase their sugar consumption from the present 10 kg per capita per annum to the European average of 35 kg per capital per annum . #% My understanding is that there is no proven health risk and surely it must be possible to have a factual and credible statement with regard to this . #% As the corollary decision to this decision taken by the EU leaders , the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy will be just that - a review of the CAP rather than a reform . #% It would seem that at the instigation of Ms Patricia McKenna , the Greens broke this understanding . #% We were well placed because of our links with the ACP countries , although there was an issue over their waiver which clouded the discussions , and because we have always worked well with NGOs . #% I recently visited Guatemala with Trocaire , an Irish NGO . #% On behalf of the Green Group , I went with the Committee on Fisheries last year to Morocco and the Moroccans were very clear : they did not want to sign the last agreement . #% We also believe that the Indonesian Government should call a halt to the army 's commercial activities in Papua . #% I should like , on behalf of my PPE-DE Group colleagues and , I suspect , all colleagues , to be treated on a par with both the European Commission and the Council delegates who will be there . #% These appalling incidents highlight dramatically the contradictory attitudes to migration and refugee policies in the EU . #% It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible , but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro . #% I would like to make a few comments concerning the outcome of the recent Irish referendum , that was held on the Nice Treaty . #% There must be some restrictions and some controlling mechanisms and methods with regard to that liberalisation . #% Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland . #% It is very important to ask ourselves what precisely do we mean by weapons of mass destruction . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them . #% There have been some advances , such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation , in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential . #% It is in that context that I favour a framework directive . #% Could I ask that Mr Prodi be given the opportunity to come and explain in more detail his views on these very sensitive issues , because interference or ill-judged comment at this stage will not be helpful if we want to get the present constitutional treaty through in the 15 Member States , let alone in the 25 . #% Through their resolution in the UN Ireland and Sweden have taken the initiative in accordance with the Canberra Commission proposal for a nuclear weapon-free world . #% If our turn is never to be reached , we should be told to put down a written question to the Commissioners . #% While I object to paying such high rates of VRT in a so-called single market , I recognise that VRT is a once-off tax capitalised in the value of cars . #% Both these issues are interlinked to a small extent , particularly in the context of economic criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty which prospective participants in the European Union must comply with in the single currency system . #% The Convention was not set up specifically to draft a constitution for Europe . #% This is not what we are going to get out of the IGC if things continue as they are . #% Despite our misgivings about one aspect or the other of this report , we should be brave enough to give the leadership that the people of Europe expect from this Parliament , the elected representatives of the people of Europe . #% When I have tried to put an oral question in this Parliament or in the last one , the Commissioners have basically been afraid to answer . #% What the European Union should not do is to carry out any further debate on new political developments within the Union before the Treaty of Nice has been ratified within any of our respective Member States . #% I am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and I reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud . #% An opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act . #% My government welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Commissioner and the programmes she has launched . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying , on behalf of my group , that we are very strongly in favour of continuing a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union , because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for securing guarantees for the continuation of social and economic development in a lot of coastal regions of the European Union , which would have no other benefit and could not get employment or other developments except from their own natural resources , for example fishing and aquaculture . #% Parliament should take the opportunity presented by today 's debate to reaffirm its commitment to the political aim of reaching a wide-ranging and comprehensive agreement with South Africa which is fair to the interests of both parties . #% Is the Council aware of the situation in Britain to which I have referred ? #% It is not without significance that only when a red-faced Dublin Government published proposals for penalties to deal with this issue that , at the behest of Irish MEPs and others , this oral question was raised . #% The lack of trust in the fishing industry in Scotland and Ireland - and it is also true of Spain - is to be regretted . #% We want to enact a new Treaty that will command the support of the people of Europe and which will oversee the smooth running of the European Union for the next 50 years . #% Mr President , I welcome the emphasis in this directive on the need to reduce discarded packaging and the increase in the targets for the recycling of packaging waste . #% Those working in the service sector need the guarantee that their employment rights are protected . #% It is not in the interests of what we are trying to achieve . #% Thus I support the essence of the TSE structures endorsed in this report . #% Mr President , I would like you to take up this matter with the Italian authorities to secure an apology for Mrs Baldi from the appropriate authorities and Mr di Pietro . #% In the Constitutional Affairs Committee , I have observed at first hand the strategy and scheming of arch Europhiles . #% I am concerned that , whereas the rate of appropriations from the Community budget for trans-European networks in the field of transport measures continues to be at a satisfactory level , a number of Member States have failed to advance the necessary monies for these TENs projects . #% The concentration of infrastructural development in cities must not be at the expense of other areas . #% It is not therefore entirely correct perhaps to attribute to the free movement of people the extent of the problem which exists . #% We have made this argument very clearly and we will make it again . #% The opponents of monetary union have already come to this conclusion and are actively engaged in bringing their case to the electorate in many of our Member States . #% It has come about to achieve this technical agreement . #% In particular I welcome the information it contains regarding the EU-China human rights dialogue . #% Mr President , Prime Minister , thank you for your presentation of the Spanish Presidency 's priorities . #% It is also the view of my own group , which passionately supports that way forward . #% Such instability is certainly not in the long term interests of the European farm model which we purport to represent in the context of Agenda 2000 . #% This will not be done by the corrupt local elites , nor by European multinational corporations whose key motivation is private profit , but by the forestry workers and the indigenous peoples themselves taking democratic ownership of their resources . #% Until we find a way of encouraging all the Member States to do this , there is no point in one Member State doing it , there is no point in two or even three , four or five Member States : it has to be right across the board of all Member States or else you will end up with massive recriminations between Member States as to who is doing what . #% Mr Nordmann - I congratulate him on his report - is correct to cite the need to tighten fraud detection systems in the countries of origin . #% It is rather unfair that if you are at the back of the Chamber or if you are not at least six foot tall , you can not gain attention . #% I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding . #% However , the word is empty without the reality . #% I am not saying the Commission is perfect , but we can not oblige the Commission to say `` you must crack the whip and every Member State in the European Union will respond '' , because it will not happen . #% I would ask the Commission to lift its ban on state aids to national , particularly small , airlines . #% Last year the European Union established a human rights dialogue with China . #% Of course , the environmental benefits of renewable energy are obvious . #% I note that there are divergent opinions as to the danger they pose and would appreciate clarification to that effect as soon as possible . #% We need to tighten up the law and ensure that examination practised does not permit the patenting of software or business methods . #% I would ask you , now that you are President of the Council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal . #% 
This will result in fragmentation of the purpose and focus of legislation . #% Through the air transport liberalization programme the European Union has taken steps to create the climate necessary for airlines to offer competitively priced airfares to the citizens of Europe . #% The vast majority of them are believed to have been involved in entirely peaceful activities . #% Every citizen wants action on radioactive waste . #% Finally , I compliment and reassure Mr Ahern on his continuing mastery of the English language so that he might have the confidence to abandon the foolish notion of wasting millions of euros of taxpayers ' money on making Irish an official language of these institutions . #% I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work . #% I wish to put on the record my support for the Treaty of Nice . #% I welcome the measures proposed by the Commission to ease the direct transit of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia . #% I agree with the principles of transparency and public accessibility which are at the heart of the proposal to amend Article 40 to include a provision for public access to paediatric clinical trial information . #% My fear is that Thursday evening is not the optimum time to try to do it . #% I think the idea of the coastguard for Ireland is particularly important because we are an island . #% If there are , could you tell us ( a ) what the problems are , and ( b ) which Member States are concerned ? #% The Union for Europe Group , of which I am a member , initiated a peace mission last week to Angola . #% Therefore , I can go along with what was proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , to ensure that this kind of debate can take place ; to ensure that some of the lies that were told in the past about what was in the Treaty are refuted ; and to ensure that those rightful concerns that people have with regard to the future of Europe are given an opportunity to be aired within a public debate . #% Will you be making a strong case for Community interests ? #% However , I have often thought that development cooperation is one area in which we could improve our cooperation . #% For example , an organization in Ireland called ASH estimates that the tobacco industry and its appalling campaign to ensure that more and more young people take up smoking kill six times more people in Ireland each year than road accidents , work accidents , drugs , murder , suicide and AIDS . #% This year , in particular - the International Year of the Disabled - we should also be working more actively towards integrating people with disabilities into the workforce . #% It is important to understand that a Commissioner , Commissioner Verheugen in this case , has a role to speak for Europe . #% I would like to ask the two people who accused me of voting on Mr Hyland 's card to withdraw and apologise . #% This whole institution lacks any kind of democratic control or democratic accountability . #% Spain , often criticised this House , was one of them . #% If we are serious about trying to encourage firms in the right direction then we have to encourage the best available technology . #% It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped . #% I believe we now have a reasonable decision from conciliation . #% This temporary opt-out provision should only last for the pilot phase because from 2008 onwards we are obliged to achieve legally-binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol . #% The one area of concern I have is in relation to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers - ICANN . #% The days of kid-glove treatment for drug pushers and the unseen drug barons must end . #% Debates of recent months have highlighted and prioritised the public health aspect of European and national food policy of which BSE is the most significant . #% It is now clearly established that the EU-assisted programmes , such as Leader , have the potential to create sustainable employment in rural areas where more centralised programmes would have failed . #% We have not had too much experience of journeys to us as oppposed to our students going to Eastern European countries and that is an area where our education could be considerably improved . #% We are not keeping them and we will not unless we change direction . #% Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies . #% With new technology and the availability of more financially rewarding opportunities for young people , let us not close our eyes to this real threat . #% I returned again this year on Good Friday , and that hospital has not received one single patient , has not received one single trainee , nurse or medical assistant . #% Vitally important is the introduction of means of using the present crisis to respond to the environmental crisis by increasing efficiency , through thorough environmental management systems . #% There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations . #% I think the word ` criminal ' has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this . #% However , we are glad to see that this has gone through . #% Madam President , I had not intended to intervene but some of the questions that have been raised here and in the debate are based , perhaps , on a certain misunderstanding . #% A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt . #% But it happened , and it is something that in my opinion the European Union does not devote enough attention to . #% What have the Council and the Committee on Fisheries done ? #% Power plants generally are a ticking time-bomb in our midst . #% There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date . #% I should like to say , in respect of enlargement , that my group , as the others too have expressed here today , is extremely pleased to see that negotiations will open soon with the six additional States of Central and Eastern Europe . #% Mr President , the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed less than 18 months ago by all the Heads of State and Government . #% The major financiers who would be interested in cherrypicking the key commuter belt rail services are not interested in providing rail services in the western corridor of the island of Ireland , for instance . #% It has now been conclusively proven scientifically and yet we here in the European Union are not capable nor even have the courage ... #% Recently , when asked how far I thought certain Members would go in foreign policy , I said I would be convinced of the intentions of colleagues when I saw Members of the Union who hold permanent seats on the Security Council of the United Nations offering one of those seats to Europe . #% This new Agency will provide Member States of the EU and the European Commission with the necessary technical and scientific support in order to effectively implement Community legislation in the field of maritime safety and to prevent pollution from ships . #% Secondly , concerning the Stern report on economic environmental matters , I know you can not speak on behalf of Finland but I also know it has one of the best records on alternative energy use and recovery of energy . #% However , the conditions must be right . #% The waters east of Canada have seen fishing vessels from Spain , France and England for hundreds of years . #% We have overruled and mixed up what we have voted for in the draft Statute by the previous vote . #% Apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits , this can actually be justified on competition grounds . #% We have to be careful of that and we look to you to utilise your resources and skills in those areas . #% In the wake of the disaster and the many other catastrophes we have witnessed we can all agree that maritime transport must be made a lot safer and there must be far better coordination of actions in all Member States . #% We in Parliament have exercised a certain amount of power already with regard to this piece of legislation , and it would be a pity if we did not continue to exercise this power wisely . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution as it underlines the horrific circumstances that the vast majority of the Palestinian population in Gaza live in today and , in particular , calls for the ` immediate ' and ` unconditional ' opening of all Gaza 's borders . #% We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly - they are already doing this in New Zealand . #% Rather than investing billions of euro in new nuclear plants , we need to invest that money in developing renewable energy sources . #% As well as obtaining agreement on the legal status of the Euro and the general principles of ERM II , the Irish presidency has maintained and deepened the momentum towards a single currency . #% The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things , and the Greens will , as usual , support the Commission . #% We often debate resolutions in this House about human rights lawyers and journalists being assassinated in the exercise of their duty in other parts of the world . #% I have problems with any continuation of the use of tattoos , and the Environment Committee is of the same view . #% 
The challenge for us as policy-makers is how to increase food production in a sustainable way , how to produce more from less , how to manage our stocks and how to deal with the issue of stock dislocation that the Commissioner has identified . #% I should like to ask the Minister , in the spirit of Christmas , by wishing him well , if he does get that job at the airport , could he do something about direct flights to Strasbourg ? #% An issue which should be addressed concerns the sourcing of funding aid through the European Fisheries Fund for inshore fishermen badly affected by legislative or policy changes relating to their fishery . #% One of the issues that is constantly ignored in Ireland and elsewhere is the contradiction between our spending a considerable amount of money on development aid in assisting developing countries , and yet maintaining a common agricultural system which , at the same time , undermines the very people we claim to be trying to help with our development aid . #% Maybe it is too late tonight , but it is important . #% Of course we must have protections in place to ensure that those who are guilty of wrongdoing , fraud , racketeering and of interfering with Community assets and finances should be excluded from public contracts . #% Of course , it is not just the company that has a responsibility . #% They are going to ask the Irish people to vote again on the same Treaty with declarations attached which are not legally binding . #% We have already seen what happens : schools , churches and post offices close and people move away from the countryside to the towns . #% It is also up to us to live up to our commitments . #% These decisions , however , were tarnished by an unseemly squabble among some Member States about the location of European agencies which reflected the worst features of the old way of running Europe . #% In particular I would like to thank the Germans for not only pushing ahead for progress in peace concerning Kosovo , but peace on the issues concerning Northern Ireland . #% Consequently we have no right to compromise on the quality of water or to cut deals here on the quality of water . #% On the other hand , I would like to draw attention to a point made by Mr Mulder in his report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development : he points out that , with an eye to Project 2000 , we can not expect to finance the enlargement of the European Union out of shavings off agricultural spending . #% In a global competitive market we have no option but to ensure that we press ahead and we believe that Article 32 should remain unchanged . #% For this reason I have serious doubts about the proposal to maintain the present budget ceiling into the next perspective . #% Could the Commission explain what has changed and why it does not see any illegality at the moment , whereas a year ago it seemed that the Irish Government was in breach of the common fisheries policy regulations by allowing this vessel to fish in Community waters ? #% If the money is not secured in the budget and a preventive approach can not be taken , the consequences , financial and otherwise , may be much greater . #% It has always failed to deal with the real issue , namely the closing-down of Sellafield . #% We will have something like 80 % of the economy of the European Union in the system and there will be one or two countries who want to join but whose currencies are too weak . #% This is the only way to ensure that the fulfilment of basic human rights becomes an indispensable aspect of our cooperation , not only with the Republic of Vietnam but with all the countries of the region . #% Would he agree that the European Union , as well as the institutions within the European Union , should encourage and support this development and also that these further developments would strengthen the case for the Irish language to become a working language of the European Union and the institutions of the European Union ? #% Other important proposals include cross-border checking of persons convicted of sexual abuse , to prevent them from obtaining employment where they would have direct contact with children in other Member States , and increased victim protection during investigations and trials . #% Although I feel that we have been successful in raising the awareness and communicating the severity of the situation over the years , we must maintain pressure to ensure that research into the cause of these mortality rates continues and remains well funded . #% We need to use our current aid budget effectively , that is not just more aid , but better aid . #% You can not be a terrorist by night and a politician by day . #% However , it is a source of regret that latterly this process has slowed down and it is indeed a worrying development . #% As we move towards enlargement of the European Union , with the accession of new Member States , and extend freedom of movement opportunities to countries outside of the accession countries to deal with shortfalls of medical personnel across the European Union , we consider that experts in the field from the existing Member States must be included in any such consultation process . #% Many other important arguments and proposals are put forward in this resolution and my group is particularly pleased that at the outset of the report Mr Schulz stresses the decisive role of the family in ensuring the balanced development of children . #% It is very important that we look at this question when it comes up in the House . #% I welcome this report ' s action call on this issue to look after the interests of these tormented victims and its emphasis on the immediate need to ensure that there is no sanctuary for terrorism in this European Union . #% The attempts that have been made at European level to tackle this problem are inadequate . #% As I said in Hong Kong and as I said in this House previously , my stance has been that this is a false impression . #% It is quite extraordinary that we have this situation . #% Or maybe he thought I was too hard a nut to crack because - let me make it very clear here tonight - in the future , Commissioner , I have to say to you that you in the Commission are no longer going to tie the hands of the farmers of Europe behind their backs on meat standards which they meet every day of the week and then come here and lecture us about the WTO and everything else . #% I am particularly pleased that my group , the Union for Europe Group , played an important part in ensuring that this vitally important matter is the subject of a report from the Regional Affairs Committee . #% Therefore , we have to make it quite clear that if there have to be changes in behaviour and technology they must be made or else there will be penalties . #% Please do not take me seriously but I really am frustrated with the way we are headed . #% Mr President , there are grave defects in the Council proposal because the environmental and energy-saving clauses are aspirational only and the Charter will provide no binding legal instruments for dealing with what are admitted on all sides to be really grave environmental degradation and pollution and seriously deficient energy-saving norms in the Eastern European states , which they show no signs of changing . #% One paper talked of a bizarre show of relaxed leaders who dodged the most crucial issues facing Europe . #% I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority . #% I am not sure whether the directive covers private aircraft , I feel that it does . #% It is a matter of the privilege of this House . #% The most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation . #% Our problems with the resolution are not just on this point - although it is a very serious issue . #% I wish to thank Commissioner Nielson for his reply . #% I am thinking in particular of the Vaxholm-Laval case , which is clearly a challenge in my view to the operation of the directive . #% An European Union initiative is urgently required in this respect . #% I am also disappointed the Council did not give its explicit support for a legal framework for public services in the context of competition regulations , as the European Parliament urged . #% Will you give us an assurance that you will come back to this House in March with a proper proposal as to what you intend to do - what measures you intend to bring in - to actually control this situation ? #% For the English-speaking world I would venture to put on record that the acceptance of non-conventional medicine is a core value in that culture and is woven out of three different strands . #% Parliament confuses itself with this argument about what is compulsory and non-compulsory . #% Presented with this information , I hope that ECOFIN and the Commission will be sufficiently persuaded , at the very least , to extend duty-free beyond the 30 June next year . #% However , we have to be careful to tread very softly with regard to constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms . #% It would therefore be premature to draw any conclusions on the outcomes of the deliberations of the Conference . #% Firstly , with regard to the Lisbon Agenda , there is still so much lacking in terms of the necessary legislative framework that must be put in place to make Lisbon a reality . #% It is demonstrated throughout this Community that , in particular when dealing with employment problems , local administration can be very effective in dealing with the European funding . #% For that reason it is extremely important that the most severe restrictions are put into place in Great Britain . #% We demand that the EU as a whole makes its concerns known to the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and call for an end to the current abuse of human rights . #% I am asking that , as an amendment , the Bureau should be presented with the report as soon as possible rather than to have it at the outset of the examination of the 1998 draft estimates . #% in writing . - This resolution calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that Parliament is fully consulted on the organisation and arrangement of judicial training . #% We should give serious consideration to any report bearing his name . #% One other concern of mine is that some Member States will give these proposals good support and others , including my own , will do what they have always done with such initiatives : nothing ! #% Finally , our most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia , to show them that now that they are part of the European Union , they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously . #% I believe his own personal safety is at risk and I hope that when Parliament votes on this resolution that the Philippine Government will be made aware of the serious concern we have for Father Cullen 's personal safety and for his campaign to protect these very much at-risk children . #% Applause from the centre and the left #% 
I welcome what is before us here this evening . #% We had group meetings ; I was watching the screen and you jumped from Question 41 to 49 . #% Also yesterday , the Islamic Courts vowed to practice Sharia Law throughout the country and , in particular , in Mogadishu . #% Moving on to the various proposals within the work programme , I welcome the initiatives now being taken on a communication on children 's rights . #% Mr President , There are many things on which Mr von Habsburg and I would not agree . #% I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week . #% I am sorry if the Member thought I was introducing a red herring . #% Of course , we need to do that , but no matter how often or how well we do that , there will still be a need for people to move into the wealthier parts of Europe . #% It is because we are not as committed to this problem as we should be . #% Effective measures need to be introduced to prevent the formation and activities of violent groups in Europe and collaboration between such groups . #% If anything , it should provide the political imperative to ensure that it never happens again . #% I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental matters stay at the top of the agenda during its presidency of the Union . #% Now is the time , we believe , to cool it ; the time for cool heads and calm reflection ; the time for a renewed but deepened commitment to resorting and sustaining the peace . #% I strongly feel that we , as politicians in the democratic world , have a great responsibility to uphold the principles of non-violence and to ensure that such unjustifiable violence does not escalate . #% One of the great advantages , however , of being a Member State of the European Union is having access to other Member States ' cooperation and knowledge base . #% It seems a long time since I tabled an amendment for a derogation -- not from the targets , but from the timetable -- for Ireland , Greece and Portugal and I thank colleagues for their understanding . #% So we go back now to the Conference of Presidents , because that is where the pressure for this particular rule came from . #% I can not understand how the Commission can go for a study by anonymous authors and ignore information provided by its own main committee . #% I am not at ease with voting for Niebler but it is a better ethical position than creating new embryos for destruction . #% We have a responsibility to ensure that multinational firms are unable to transport their damage and their behaviour to the developing world because of restrictions that we may place upon them within the European Union . #% I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences , some of which are very serious . #% But the question here is how can this actually be ensured ? #% The CAP post 2013 should support active producers and reward them for the food they produce and the many public goods they provide to society - including high animal welfare and environmental standards . #% I had to let him go because there was no help he could give , all on the basis of health and safety . #% The number of placements obtained to EURES , rose from 26 449 in 1998 to 44 460 in 1999 : that is an increase of more than 68 % in one year and the potential for more placement is much greater . #% There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers . #% We have set out our solutions in paragraph 44 . #% The United States should not be allowed to force this to be changed . #% I must say that I admire the technicians and other people who have been criticised here . #% Ireland is particularly well placed to improve relations with our American friends and I hope that the Irish presidency will further strengthen and deepen relations between the Eruopean Union and the United States . #% However , in recent times , the value of the euro currency has substantially increased as political and economic stability within the European landscape has re-emerged . #% I know personally that three accession countries are having serious problems . #% It is somewhat ironic that it is the US that is taking the lead on this issue despite the historic links and relationship between Britain , Burma and its people . #% I come from a State that is non-nuclear and against electricity being generated from nuclear power . #% We in Parliament have made the whole drugs issue a top priority . #% I would like to put on record my reasons for voting against certain sections of Mr Färm 's report today , in particular those paragraphs dealing with agriculture . #% I appreciate not only his efforts in helping to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference but his long-standing interest in European affairs and his long-term efforts to promote the integration and the union of Europe . #% As regards costs , the Committee on Budgets added approximately EUR 400 million in horizontal cuts that the Council deducted from the budget so we added EUR 400 million this morning . #% The Irish Government has never yet appointed a woman to the Court of Auditors . #% Finally , I welcome the Dublin Declaration on Employment . #% It seems to me as well that there is an urgent need for this Parliament to be treated as a parliament and for the secrecy in relation to these negotiations to end . #% We have already agreed this in the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive . #% I feel there are inadequacies in the scoreboard itself . #% The argument about fear of a World Trade Organisation challenge is completely unfounded . #% The Community shall complement the Member States ' action in reducing drug-related health damage , including information and prevention . #% If a country is rich , powerful and developed it can be blessed with such natural resources , but it seems that the fate of a poor country with such gifts is exploitation , strife and international meddling . #% Mr President , as we have already heard , there are many actors involved in what we have to do in order to meet our responsibilities . #% I am calling on the Commission to intervene urgently to have the construction of this road stopped until a full review is carried out as to why the environmental impact study did not identify this major archaeological site when it was identified by a state-sponsored organisation , An Foras Forbartha , in 1983 . #% Ireland is losing ground in this battle in relation to climate change . #% My few words are in regard to the De Luca report on the policy on tourism within the Union . #% We must get involved in the debate , we have to persuade people here and in our own Member States . #% I am now asking the Council and the Commission to make an immediate decision at 5 % set-aside with the current level of area aid maintained . #% The title of the report is very broad-ranging and the report itself correspondingly deals with very many issues and very many countries . #% Furthermore , Article J ( 7 ) of the Amsterdam Treaty , a protocol attached to the Treaty , was an Irish addition and intended to prevent the Irish people from knowing the real implications of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% If our concerns are for animals , we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals . #% Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee . #% There have been a lot of spurious arguments here tonight , particularly about thresholds for receiving funding . #% When we look at the legal systems in many countries , we find the actual application of law is unacceptable . #% The long-term effect of the common agricultural policy in that sense will be greater than people have often imagined . #% Yes , we need self-regulation and partnership , but Internet service providers have to prioritise this . #% This register would simply give information to those seeking to employ people in the form of a ` yes ' or ` no ' about a previous conviction . #% It is right , however , that Parliament should emphasize that the development of democracy and respect for the rule of law is a priority and that steps will be taken if any applicant country displays manifest shortcomings in this respect . #% Andalucia will be consulted in the normal way through the consultation process with Member States as far as the Council is concerned . #% Because issues such as caring in the home , violence in the home , trafficking of women and many other issues that are seen as women 's issues are not just women 's issues , they are societal issues . #% Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers . #% We only have to look at the progress in some Member States , including the Netherlands , to see that this is a perfectly attainable percentage . #% 
These are serious issues . #% It is wrong to include antibiotics in food . #% I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group . #% From the earliest times many of us learned the story of St Joseph taking the child and his mother to Egypt because King Herod planned to kill him . #% There is something surrealistic - and in fact disgusting - about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war . #% The point of substance about the role of the Commission is that it is at the heart and core of the European project - and it is indispensably so - and that is the structure of truth which we must promote , defend and constantly revisit . #% We must act as the guarantor of those rights . #% It is of fundamental importance that the United States adheres to the principles of human rights . #% I hope they will , because there is a clear need for a long-term constitutional framework for the new Europe of 25 countries , which may well become even larger during this decade . #% Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly . #% The BSE crisis of recent years must never again threaten European consumers , farmers and the beef industry . #% So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority . #% I hope that common sense will prevail . #% Rather than face reality , I fear that we will again face a Brussels conspiracy to circumvent the people . #% I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted . #% The timeframe for use of this fund is limited and no time must be lost in providing the services needed . #% I welcome efforts this week to finalise an EU-wide arrest warrant to deal with these criminal ` people smugglers ' who benefit financially from the misery and desperation of others . #% If such difficulties present themselves , I would make an appeal to you as President-designate of the Commission , Professor Prodi , please to make sure that difficulties do not become crises . #% Points made in relation to the physiological effects must be reinstated . #% Let us put our hands on our hearts and commit ourselves to peace , to justice , but , most importantly of all , to humanity . #% It is important for mobile professionals to realise that they must be proficient in the language of their host country since the ability to communicate is a prerequisite for practising . #% Get the sides talking , keep them talking . #% I hope EU governments now respond to this strong message from Parliament . #% I do not believe such a move is in the best interests of the future of the Union . #% Having approached the whole of the negotiations in a way that sought to accommodate , I was very disappointed that , on one particular issue , my views were not accommodated . #% I am actually somewhat disappointed , because there seems to be a big difference between the rules for drivers of trucks transporting animals all the way to the Middle East , and the conditions that the animals themselves are kept in . #% That system is independent of the political influence of any party in the Republic of Ireland , as I am sure the system also is in the UK , including Northern Ireland . #% The European Union , as we all know , has a population of 370 million and , with enlargement , the Union 's population will rise to 500 million . #% The Israeli Government does not serve the interests of the Palestinian masses , nor of the Israeli working class . #% My own peripheral region has received only 10 % of all EU funding to Ireland over the past 30 years and is therefore still seriously under-developed in terms of infrastructure . #% The revolutions there demonstrate that a risen working class and the risen poor are more powerful than even the most brutal repressive methods , the most repressive regimes . #% I do not know where the honourable Member has been for the last few minutes but he certainly has not drawn that conclusion from anything I have said here . #% There are things that make us different , but they need not divide us if we can show tolerance , respect and understanding for them . #% Even a small earthquake in the Cumbrian region could breach the storage tanks . #% I particularly welcome the putting in place of rules which seek to guarantee that food imported from outside the Union must meet with the same rigorous standards that apply to producers within the EU . #% But how and when we get to this point of a ban should be a matter for all stakeholders involved , including the Commission , the regional advisory councils ( RACs ) , the fishermen , the scientific experts , the national governments and NGOs , and fishery by fishery if necessary . #% Our experience in Northern Ireland should demonstrate that there is nothing honourable , enlightened or desirable about pandering to terrorism or finding excuses for it -- it is evil in all its forms . #% In the absence of market management mechanisms and taking into account the risks involved , the current force majeure clause could provide flexibility for Member States to cope with unforeseen events such as market failure , and avoid serious economic shocks . #% We need specialized , centralized courts in all our countries who will be well briefed and will deal with these cases within 24 hours of them being brought to their notice . #% in writing . - I voted for this report as Europe 's 10-12 million Roma should benefit from binding minimum standards at EU level to improve their access to employment , education , housing and healthcare . #% We are due to hear in this debate from one of Sinn Féin / IRA 's representatives in this House . #% Mr President , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union . #% I have always supported the need for improved labelling provisions so as to ensure that the consumer information is transparent and effective . #% Could the Commission indicate whether it will be proposing the repealing or amending of this regulation , because this is a most important issue . #% In 1997 Ireland for example received over IEP 1.4 million from the European Union for the administration of the school milk programme . #% We must arrive at some form of genuine cooperation between the courts ; there are a great many areas in the legal systems in all of our countries that need to be carefully reassessed in the light of this very difficult and growing problem . #% It seems to me that the Spanish Government is to be congratulated in bringing about a situation in which a ceasefire has been announced . #% The environmental problems have already been named : greenhouse gases - CO2 above all , but also methane , as my colleague , Mr Stockmann , has ably explained ; nuclear power , where there are operational problems and , of course , problems in the disposal of waste and in the transport of fuels ; and oil exploration and production which also involve dangers . #% Today 's resolution is a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citizens . #% Even if it does not cost the Community budget any money , it gives some farmers in strong currency areas payments at the expense of farmers in weak currency countries . #% I always tell the story of the first time I came here in 1979 . #% The Council shows every sign of sticking to its old tradition of watering down these proposals so that the improvements in fishing will be even less than is hoped for . #% It should have stood its ground and maintained solidarity . #% I also support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East , including Syria and Iran . #% Recycling the Luxembourg guidelines grandiosely as an employment pact will make no difference to Europe 's unemployed . #% I call on Member States to encourage the development of national bioenergy action plans and welcome my own Government 's move towards encouraging bioenergy production and incentives in the transport sector , as evidenced in last week 's budget in my country . #% However , it also saddens me to say that there have been many times when I have listened to the debate on this issue both in the committee and here in the Chamber and it seems that we are totally unconnected with the reality of what is happening outside these walls . #% Mr President , we must say to Mr Santer that it is encouraging to see that he is proposing certain reforms . #% We must encourage an emotional environment that is conducive to having children . #% It is not in our constitution nor our statute law . #% Our traditional exports are gradually being reopened for beef for most Member States . #% It is in the financial interests of the producer and the exporter that the animals arrive in tip-top condition . #% While welcoming bench-marking and sharing best practice at Union level , we see such measures as complementary to , but no substitute for , structural adjustment in labour , product and service markets and employment-friendly tax policy at Member State level . #% But we are at one minute to midnight for such a solution . #% We also have to look at NATO where there needs to be a review because , as far as I can see , the US has demonstrated quite clearly its contempt for the whole issue of nuclear disarmament at an international level . #% I think it is the Presidency that stands indicted tonight for their absence . #% 
In some ways , as we enter , in terms of direct mandates , our twenty-first year we have now achieved this new age of maturity . #% The directive on inter-Community trade in bovine animals is central to the economic survival of livestock farmers , particularly from my own country , Ireland , where we export up to 90 % of our entire livestock production - a very high proportion of which is live exports to continental Europe and beyond . #% It is my hope that the most dramatic reform since the CAP was first introduced will lead to greater stability and provide a much-needed stimulus for young people to take up farming as a full-time career . #% The only feasible third party would be a team of international observers . #% I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka , which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland , and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self-determination . #% I want to point out that President McAleese apologised fulsomely and without reservation within hours of making the remarks . #% Risk assessment can not be left to each Member State under the terms of framework Directive 89/391 , because it is a Community competence only . #% Surely , a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available . #% In Irish one would say , which means be ready , be vigilant . #% It is a serious problem in a small country such as my own . #% Food is an internationally tradable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe . #% We hope that now that a management regime is put in place , the Commission will act quickly to strengthen it - for instance by other means , such as much stronger technical measures and more restrictive effort controls . #% One of the most important areas we need to look at is how best we can create a society in which people are protected from the dangers presented to them . #% We have to empower more women at all levels of political representation in Europe . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to say that I very much appreciate the comprehensive statement made in the debate this morning by Commissioner Patten on the many complex issues which remain to be contended with in this very difficult area . #% However , the reality is that they are trying to prevent positive action being taken , and to prevent real debate taking place on issues of concern to the people of Europe . #% It is those kinds of skills that we sorely miss now that she is ex-chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs . #% They also coincide with the Irish presidency plans as outlined in the Culture Committee in January . #% We abstained on the two Christodoulou reports and we did so in order to signal our political differences with other colleagues on one central issue . #% The fund should help slow the trend of increasing unemployment in Munster and will provide a major boost for the local economy as those affected by the closure of the Dell plant return to the workforce . #% Without being complacent , we have established some protection for EU citizens . #% In the light of all the problems we have had with ineffective implementation , I would like to see the Commission work more strongly on publicizing best practice - good models of using funds effectively . #% You became Finance Minister just as Ireland 's Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EU 's poorest nations to its financial summit . #% I can not see how the Council can now wash its hands of at least discussing the possibility of lifting those sanctions . #% It may be a reduction of 8.5 % in the fishing fleet but it is a reduction of at least 18 % in capacity . #% Figures recently produced from the Central Statistics Office clearly show that the midland region was below 75 % of the average EU standard of living . #% Amendments Nos 32 and 36 concerning antibiotics have to be rejected . #% Let 's be frank about it ; many of the Member States have or are facing economic collapse . #% No approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we , in Europe , stand up for . #% I find it impossible to work on that basis . #% Mr President , for a period of six weeks there was a form of peace in the Middle East and our attention turned to Iraq . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , I welcome the priorities of the Irish presidency put forward here today . #% The whole question of transition arrangements is of the greatest importance . #% The ELDR also strongly urges those Member States which meet the criteria , namely Denmark , Sweden and the United Kingdom , to join the euro . #% The great firewall of China is perhaps the starkest example of such censorship . #% But here the European fleets did help . #% In particular , I wish to see mutual recognition and respect for decisions and judicial processes . #% The kind of late-night dealing and smoke-filled rooms that finalised the treaty was the unacceptable face of the EU and it is not worthy of a Union of 350 million people . #% Building a stronger democratic structure must be a key aspect of development efforts . #% I support a strong political dimension to the new cooperation agreements with ACP countries , especially in the areas of human rights , good governance and the rule of law . #% I am sure there are similar programmes in other countries , but the OECD report on local development in Ireland is one which I would commend to Members of this House . #% It is our obligation to seek peace for Northern Ireland . #% The European Union has committed over EUR 200 million in recent years to help rebuild Afghanistan , and the European Union must take the decision financially to support the Iranian Government for a number of years so as to ensure that the basic social infrastructural and educational needs are addressed in the reconstruction process of Bam . #% Finally , the Council representative has alluded to the fact that the right of citizenship is also applicable to children and minors , and is therefore a basis for common action . #% So this is disgraceful . #% We feel that an ethical code of conduct on arms exports should not be dictated by the needs of the European defence industry . #% This will allow progress to be made on the matter in 2004 . #% Mr President , the reconstruction of Afghanistan has not , in my view , remotely begun , despite the assurances given in the House today . #% I would like to point out that 66.9 % of those inquiries related to the European Commission -- so much for the Commission as guardian of the Treaties . #% This is a cruel blow for all those who faithfully served the industry for generations . #% The provisions for legislation that is fully aware of the needs and requirements of its intended recipients are welcome , as is the adaptation of public policy tools to the needs of SMEs . #% Which comes first : children 's health or the vested interests of industry ? #% I have consistently supported the view that the Commission 's best friend is the European Parliament . #% We should get our priorities right . #% So , Commissioner McCreevy had the right to express his opinion . #% I am aware also , of the extent to which , in your many years of service in this House , you personally were committed to issues of institutional reform . #% I strongly oppose this proposal . #% However , I do believe that EU Governments have been very pro-active with regard to implementing broad information campaigns concerning the forthcoming practical changes . #% Does the presidency agree that it would be wise to set aside some resources under a special Community initiative for unexpected crises to enable the Union to act in such situations ? #% Unless you are a person with a disability , you do not know what is necessary to allow you to participate in society on an equal footing . #% I would urge the Commission to underpin the decentralisation process by creating a Europe-wide network of regional advisory committees . #% Finally , I would like to give my full support to the promotion of the European Year Against Violence Against Women : awareness-raising is crucial . #% With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that . #% On our housing crisis ? #% Mr Piétrasanta wanted to strengthen this resolution by saying that the gear should be obligatory rather than just simply encouraged . #% That is why the European Union must respond in a coordinated and structured manner so as to guarantee that the best educational methods in the field of information technology are available to all our students . #% 
I want to speak a little about what our role as parliamentarians should be . #% Like many other species , stocks are far below sustainable levels , and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities . #% This is a fundamentally important social and economic objective if the European Union is to take advantage of new e-commerce and related business activities . #% Yet , according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union , of the 43 961 members of parliaments worldwide only 16.4 % are women . #% In the UK and Ireland this little creature has been responsible for devastating woodlands as well as driving out the indigenous European red squirrel -- -- from many areas . #% Mr President , I compliment Mr Olsson on his work and may I commence by again putting on the record my support , and that of my Irish colleagues , for EU enlargement . #% That consensus is leading to the joint initiative he mentioned , which we shall be announcing tomorrow . #% Multilateral systems have a greater success and lay claim to greater legitimacy in upholding respect for the rule of law in relations between states . #% In November 2001 the UN General Assembly expressed concern at the very slow progress of talks between the State Peace and Development Council and the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi . #% We can at times hide behind the provisions of the Dublin Convention , which states that the first EU country that an asylum seeker enters must process their application for asylum . #% One might consider that a minor matter over which we should not get so upset . #% In my country , Ireland , where we have just introduced full decoupling from 1 January 2005 , Irish farmers feel that they face a very uncertain future as regards their income . #% At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into UN agencies and so on . #% While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far . #% Parliament can then focus on the job that it was elected to do : assessing the performance of the Council and the Commission on behalf of the people . #% Northern Ireland is an example , with all terrorist prisoners from both sides released while not one murder weapon has been decommissioned by either side . #% That was and , in many cases still is , the system . #% This week ' s discussions at the General Affairs Council are to be warmly welcomed . #% These new procedures are also going to have to be monitored in a structured manner , so as to ensure that any discrepancies in the operation of these new schemes within the different Member States of the European Union are ironed out . #% It should also be an opportunity to focus on continuing the development of economic growth and employment and also guaranteeing quality of life , quality jobs and pension entitlements for all people across the EU . #% I congratulate Mr Fiori . #% Colleagues have indicated the rate at which WEEE is growing . #% There is now great uncertainty from the perspective of regional airports across the length and breadth of the European Union with regard to how we are going to develop the low cost-airline industry in the future . #% In less than six years many of our national currencies will disappear from our pockets to be replaced by the Euro . #% Mr President , along the same lines as Mr Allister , I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that , during the summer , we witnessed the return to Dublin -- to the Republic of Ireland -- of the so-called Colombia Three . #% The President-in-Office here this morning declared that the Council was surprised at the events of the last two weeks . #% A united struggle of Sinhalese and Tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the Tamil-speaking people . #% There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame . #% The Euratom Treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need . #% I hope that the Commission will respond positively to Mr Pex 's call for the creation of an EU coastguard , and that the Irish Presidency of the Council will also heed that call , particularly since , in coming from an island , it will appreciate the value of such a body policing our high seas . #% In two of the cases I have very recently heard about , the deceased had been killed under what were considered to be suspicious circumstances . #% We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States . #% The technology is there . #% The European Union has brought forward proposals to prevent our financial systems being used for money-laundering to fund terrorist activities . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Hong Kong , I am fully behind what they are asking in the House today . #% This is necessary for the long-term survival of the European railway sector and all Member States would be in agreement with this goal . #% It would be very dangerous indeed to concentrate simply on growth and competitiveness . #% This is only right and proper , as debt relief is presently crippling many countries in the Third World . #% Most , but not all , of the fault lies with previous Commissions , as the report clearly establishes . #% This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK , Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council . #% I would like to wish you well for the future . #% Indeed , the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State , making it difficult for the victims to seek protection or redress from national authorities . #% We must bear in mind that more modern advanced microchips are being designed with authentication programmes which will be even harder to change fraudulently . #% The working time directive as proposed by the Council could result in higher costs for companies . #% Like the other institutions , the European Parliament is currently considering how things might be presented for the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% I would say that people power can win the day over bureaucracy and legal barriers . #% The disparity that has been in operation for years has a practical detriment for those states that have been complying . #% How do we keep avian flu highlighted so that we do not have a human pandemic and so that we spot the problem in wild birds , while at the same time trying to avoid scaring consumers ? #% Mr President , I welcome the reference to the Treaty of Nice in Paragraph 6 of the joint resolution . #% The Sellafield complex in Cumbria has been the largest emitter of radiation in the UK , discharging radioactive gas and liquid into the Irish Sea . #% In particular , I want to thank Mrs Anttila for her report on the transport of animals . #% However , in my view , the draft resolution by the President of the General Assembly is a reasonable attempt to do just that , an effort to find common ground . #% In relation to the reduced need for long transport , it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat . #% We -- and European citizens -- would like to see guarantees that this is where this money is going , rather than taking it at face value . #% We reach a very small number of questions , and answers are allowed to go on forever . #% We are told that Israel will use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances . #% The eventual framing of a common defence policy should allow Member States to play different roles - which they will do in any case - and to make different contributions . #% Someone in the middle is profiteering . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Andersson on his report despite the misgiving that I have with regard to some parts of it . #% In this process particular emphasis will be placed on groups requiring special attention , such as young people seeking their first job , the long-term unemployed and unemployed women . #% If colleagues think back to the early 1990s , when we had the whole Delors Plan with the white paper on the social package and so on , this was considered groundbreaking and innovative . #% The publishing industry feels that there is a lack of recognition of its particular requirements with regard to the expanding IT sector . #% The intergovernmental method of negotiating EU treaties where leaders wheel-and-deal behind closed doors on matters of importance for all our citizens has come to an end and is now also dead . #% Personally , I believe a zero threshold is the only one acceptable . #% I am sorry to say that ` fair and free ' lost . #% in writing . - As elected representatives , everyone in this Chamber will be aware of the many sacrifices which our constituents and national governments have had to make over the past three years . #% 
Last night , I was astonished by Mr Fatuzzo 's speech . #% Take Zimbabwe , for example , which Mr Deß has already referred to . #% It took us two and a half years to agree that instrument because we simply would not give up on certain core rights of Parliament , but we did have to compromise towards the end . #% Citizens are sometimes disillusioned with the EU . #% This trend towards cobbling together sloppy compromises at the Council negotiating table when Member States can not reach an acceptable political agreement is extremely worrying . #% First of all we should remember that we are dealing with an extremely poor part of the world : half a million people with a GDP per capita of something like ECU 600 annually or 3 % of the European Union average . #% Macau does boast a sound education system but its economic dependence on gambling and textiles , and its failure to attract high-tech industries do not augur well for the future employment prospects of the young population . #% I know from the very impressive representations that I have received from the medical profession - and I want to thank them for that - that more young women are actually suffering now from lung cancer . #% The Tampere special Summit , whilst focusing on immigration and asylum policy for the first time , also seriously raised the issue of trafficking in humans which has been steadily growing over the past five years . #% However , this outcome will only come about after years of wrangling and protracted uncertainty for industry . #% I also wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy to his first Question Time in Parliament and to re-emphasise at the outset that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and objectives because they can create greater wealth and employment within the European Union . #% That is why the setting of a clear date for the deployment of troops will focus the attention on a tight timescale to find a diplomatic solution to get peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur . #% Therefore , we can no longer speak of exclusively having a social model that works according to the old ideology of high taxation and high social protection . #% The reason we are discussing this now is because the issue is part of a Commission proposal , and not because it is something that Member States were looking for . #% I hope that my successors will achieve something that can be understood by European citizens . #% In conclusion , the Commission and Parliament must ensure that tough decisions are worked through in a spirit of understanding and common purpose . #% Like my colleague Mrs Doyle , I am glad to see the derogations agreed for Ireland and indeed also for Portugal and Greece . #% I should like the President-in-Office to say that the Council is going to address these issues and will bring these points of concern into a code of conduct , otherwise it is just window-dressing . #% It is a serious problem , it is a problem that is causing people who were pro-European Parliament to turn against this Parliament . #% This morning when we were discussing the Lamassoure report on the competences of the European Union and defining the competences , I thought that we should from time to time re-examine the various competences of the Union . #% Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union . #% I welcome the implementation of the SAPARD programme to help further rural development and community development within Hungary . #% By coincidence , the Commission came forward today with a working document on the performance of industries providing services of general economic interest , and this also covered telecoms . #% At a time when our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East , we have to rely on our inventiveness to earn our living . #% We need to be honest in terms of what we are looking for . #% I agree entirely with what Stephen Hughes has said : this fuels anti-European sentiment . #% I am afraid that it could have a cascade effect and certainly will damage consumer confidence within Europe , irrespective of its actual trade effect . #% This forum is also part of the debate on the overall future of Europe that is ongoing in all 15 Member States of the European Union in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 . #% When will they reply ? #% Indeed , many references to Ireland in the report are out of date . #% That night , not only was a murder committed , but also the bar was systematically wiped clean of evidence . #% We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it can not be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards . #% The European Council must again address this issue in Dublin . #% The trade in wildlife in South America is also growing and wild animals such as monkeys , birds , capybara and other large rodents , as well as tapirs , armadillos and deer , are for sale . #% I say to the President of the Council that his statement embarrasses me , and if it does that to me it must surely embarrass our colleague , Mr Haarder , who we all have known and respected as a man of principle and integrity since his time in this House . #% Let us not forget that each Member State has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights , has incorporated it into its own national law and is bound by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . #% The politics of this region must be put aside in an effort to save lives , and this motion welcomes the coordination and opening of new routes between India-controlled Kashmir and the Pakistan side . #% Mr President , this obviously is not Ryanair 's evening . #% Remembering that funding of any kind of abortion is unconstitutional and illegal in Ireland and that so-called safe abortion is included within this development aid programme , yet also remembering that Ireland has the lowest level of maternal mortality in the world - two in every 100 000 births - what is the response of the Commission to the majority of Irish citizens who are deeply concerned at this unconstitutional use of Irish tax-payers ' money ? #% in writing . - In the current economic climate , it is hard enough for small and medium businesses to survive without the added burden of late payments in commercial transactions . #% However , considering that to date the prohibition of these unwanted sites has not been so successful , what confidence do you have that your proposals will eradicate such undesirable sites from the Internet ? #% We must also make sure that the information requirements in the annex are clear . #% I believe that the WTO in its current structure and working practices is dead . #% But I want to point out to you that in the three sample cod catches on the west coast of Ireland , 98 % of the cod caught in the nets was either destroyed or severely damaged by the seals . #% We are ruling out the involvement of national parliaments , national governments and the citizens who vote us in . #% I found many very strong arguments in favour of the Gallagher amendments but , in the end , voted with my group to maintain political cohesion within the group . #% I believe that the European Union can make a major contribution towards tackling the scourge of drug abuse by concentrating its resources in a coordinated manner with the national authorities on tackling the international drugs trade . #% Mr President , pursuant to the rules brought in by the Bureau , I wish to put on record that I am present but did not partake in the vote . #% What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ? #% It is a well known fact that there is no effective public control mechanism of secret services and their undemocratic activities anywhere in the world . #% I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing . #% The Irish Government has reached an agreement with the European Commission with regard to regulating our corporation tax regime . #% The immense costs incurred in cross-border trading represent a serious barrier . #% Let us have debate and discussion . #% Uniquely in the world , Europe is developing a democratic form of transnational governance . #% In Parliament it is disgraceful that the Petitions Committee , the single most important direct contact that the citizen has with this institution and with the other institutions of the European Union , is treated the way it is treated . #% The reference in the draft Rural Charter to a fresh reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is something that causes me some concern . #% In relation to the Prestige , responsibility and liability were disputed . #% When the United States justifiably initiates a global campaign against organisations responsible for terrorism and the regimes that sponsor it , it is important for us to remind them that they allied themselves to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein when it suited their foreign policy objectives . #% With the vote on this legislation we can as Parliament say we are legislating for all citizens for equal access and equal rights . #% The Irish Government should make this change with or without Europe . #% Fishing rights for EU vessels must be re-evaluated according to the most recent scientific analyses conducted by the regional fisheries organisation of west Africa . #% At present , the Member States must contain a level of oil stocks equivalent to 90 days ' consumption for each of the three main categories of petroleum products for energy use . #% This in an impressive list and the Commission , ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit . #% Mr President , the common agricultural policy remains the single biggest item of expenditure in the Community budget . #% Mr President , I would like to remind both Mr Allister and Mr Nicholson , and indeed Mrs de Brún , that the rule of law applies in the Republic of Ireland and the law will take its course in the Republic of Ireland in relation to the case they mentioned . #% 
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing . #% It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree . #% Unfortunately , when we arrived in Lisbon , our visas were cancelled by the Angolan Ambassador to Portugal . #% Negotiations for the prospective enlargement of the European Union have accelerated at a strong pace and it is now likely that negotiations with many of the applicant countries may indeed be concluded before the end of this year . #% I agree with Mrs Pery when she says fishing communities throughout Europe have little confidence in present policy . #% From some of the speeches this morning and our discussions over the last week that if you have experience in business or politics , if you have strongly held beliefs , if you have a strong ideology , if you have a strong opinion , then , according to some , you are not suitable to be a Commissioner of the European Union . #% As regards sulphates and sulphides , it is clear that they cause asthma and , in the worst cases , death ensues . #% Yet it seems to me that what is going on here is discrimination of the most blatant nature . #% Therefore , any mechanism that helps to protect these businesses from the added costs and financial implications surrounding late payment should be welcomed . #% Only then can concrete steps be taken to address the problem . #% Why are they just looking at the industry 's tests and just going back over them ? #% I would like to assure the Members of the House that the refugees are fully aware of , and greatly value and appreciate , the earlier efforts of the European Parliament in drawing attention to their situation . #% We need more sustainable living , not only because of the carbon challenge but also because of the concerns we all share about rising energy prices and energy security . #% Sticking-plaster politics do not work . #% Yesterday evening I went to see the exhibition hosted by the Joint Research Centre . #% That is my interpretation of what you have said , Commissioner . #% EU leaders are now meeting next week , on 12 December 2003 , to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the European Union . #% The Council seems bent , unfortunately , on ignoring wider public opinion in Europe and around the world , which is in favour of a more careful and precautionary approach to fishing , and is choosing to bow to the pressure of the fishing industry . #% Some very important aspects have been included , as many other people have mentioned . #% For that reason there is not very much left to say . #% Mr President , I ask you to give this your utmost priority , because , as Annetta Flanigan said , they only went there to help the people of Afghanistan . #% We need to exclude imports where we have any doubt whatsoever . #% I ask this , not as a Member of this Parliament , but rather as a mother who can not imagine the pain this courageous family is going through . #% A British Labour MP , Ms Clwyd , received a letter from the Department of Trade and Industry acknowledging that there were 59 arms exports licences being considered by the British Government . #% There is , incidentally , a very strong gender implication to the provision of energy , because of the tasks of women throughout the developing world . #% In relation to Georgia I do not believe the Council has considered the situation there in the recent past but I will discuss the matter with my colleagues and will communicate with the honourable Member . #% Additionally , given the present geo-political climate , we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe . #% To this end , I am calling on the Government to launch a full parliamentary inquiry in the Dáil immediately into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit . #% No amendments were tabled requiring the board of a company to consult prior to a takeover bid . #% For my part , I am wary of suggestions to introduce new forms of taxation . #% It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy . #% I hope that all MEPs endorse the demand now being made by Socialist MEPs and agree to the Committee of Inquiry being established immediately . #% A major step forward was made for the European Union at the Lisbon Summit , in its commitment not only to a competitive , dynamic economy but also to a society which is cohesive and based on full employment . #% If we do not do that , it will be at our own peril . #% But it will not . #% This can only contribute to a greater openness in dealing with human rights issues . #% We must come to the conclusion , that our responsibility , as Mr Stevenson has said , is to get down to the substance and work with the Commission and the Council to come forward with a policy that hopefully will be infinitely better than the previous one . #% For many , the duty-free question has taken on a certain symbolic significance in respect of tax harmonization and the single market , a symbolism disproportionate to its market share and substance . #% It is clear , however , that the EU 's ambition is to garner that role to itself . #% We see this in its response to legitimate international concerns about its human rights record . #% Their task as guarantors of food security and quality is , as everyone in this House knows , becoming increasingly difficult . #% You will see in this resolution that we call , for example , for a dedicated unit in the Commission looking at children 's rights , looking at legislation so that we can assess its impact on the children and also on the lives of their families . #% So , finally , I implore Parliament to act to condemn China for its role in underwriting the genocide of the Sudanese people . #% They are low paid with poor working conditions and their legitimate demand is that they be represented professionally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions . #% This is a totally unacceptable way of dealing with this extremely important issue . #% Ever since the Agenda 2000 proposals for reform of the Union policies were first published in March 1998 it was always felt in some quarters that it would be difficult to find an agreement that was balanced and even-handed across all the territories of the European Union . #% I do not believe that any kind of militarising of the EU is in the interests of the people at large , either within Europe or within the world as a whole . #% Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur . #% If you are not going to allow him to take the floor , I would like to put a supplementary question to Commissioner Schreyer on Mrs Scallon 's question . #% So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul . #% The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies . #% The gamma-interferon test is the most promising of these , and is used under practical field conditions as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in herds . #% It is a renewal for four years and for the first time it gives access to EU vessels to the pelagic stocks . #% I readily admit that there is always room for improvement . #% I strongly endorse the priority which the presidency proposes to give to the objective of showing the peoples of Europe that the European Union is working for them in practical ways . #% The Euratom Treaty makes no provision for the setting or enforcement of safety standards relating to the operation of nuclear installations . #% When you consider the size of the European Union , the number of farmers involved , the area and the problems , we are spending 0.4 % of GDP on the common agricultural policy . #% Mr President , I believe that this directive represents a terrible infringement of our right to these products . #% The problem is when you ask them how to make the help really worthwhile , they are very slow to come forward with answers . #% She has pointed to cases of deliberate cruelty and mistreatment of animals which have occurred in some Member States . #% I am happy that I am able to contribute on this subject because , while I am not a member of the relevant committee , nevertheless , it is a subject that I have thought about . #% The most logical response to higher oil prices is to switch to using alternative energy sources and focus on the use of renewable energies to promote energy efficiency . #% The support we are offering today is essential . #% The implications of Amendments Nos 1 to 6 run counter to this policy . #% Since that legislation came into being , there has been no noticeable difference . #% We have to underline once again that this is the policy of the Parliament ; the Committee on Budgetary Control has called for it , with the support of Parliament , on many occasions . #% 
Madam President , last Friday I went to a neighbourhood in my constituency where up to 80 % of the households are in receipt of some form of welfare payment . #% There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace , and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers ' charter , and nothing else . #% The House has been divided and different groups have had the opportunity to put on the record their preferred optimum solution amongst the options available . #% At that time , the child can understand that the mother , or the substitute primary care-giver , will come back and is not gone forever . #% Hundreds of jobs will be lost . #% There is no such thing as national borders . #% Europe has experienced a great increase in pressures on coastal resources . #% In 1986 we saw the beginning of a terrible tragedy with the explosion of reactor 4 . #% The people have spoken and we have to accept their verdict . #% We have the opportunity to lead the world with good patent law , but are we up to the task ? #% I am highly critical of the way in which children can be abused for advertising purposes and I strongly hold the view that the rights of children must be respected . #% The committee views this with the greatest concern . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming some of the conclusions of the European Council , but I would also like to caution or criticise others . #% Large numbers of our people are concerned over their personal safety or the safety of their families . #% I need hardly say that I am totally against smoking as an ageing ex-nurse . #% I would also like to clear up a misconception . #% Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Mulder for his report and all the work he has done on it . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I am very glad that Parliament is showing such concern for the people of Tibet . #% Finally , several tuna bodies are in the throes of establishing limits on the capacity of the fishing fleets that are allowed to be involved in the fishery . #% Mr President , in setting out the presidency 's programme with regard to key policy issues , which will be addressed over the next six months by the European Union , the Spanish Prime Minister has stated that his priority of priorities during Spain 's six-months ' presidency of the EU will be the global fight against terrorism . #% The option , therefore , of vaccination has to be kept open in the interests of the wider community . #% It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure , but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out . #% Secondly , unlike my Conservative colleague , Mr Purvis , I do not believe that we should take a rigid view of the reform of funding post-2006 at this stage . #% ` As you are aware , the Regulation is an important step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the European Climate Change Action Programme . #% All these issues are closely interlinked , particularly in the case of existing net beneficiary countries , such as Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland , and those countries with significant agricultural sectors , such as France . #% I particularly would like to ask the UK , France and the United States - although we only have the opportunity in this Parliament to directly address the UK and France - to constrain and curb nuclear weapons development . #% It is essential , in relation to the threat that highways and the trans-European networks are having on mountain regions , that these protocols are properly implemented , not just in relation to the Alpine regions but also in other regions such as the Pyrenees which are in danger . #% The tabling of 1 200 amendments represents a serious divergence of views within Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% Most of the public sentiment surrounding the whole question of driftnet fishing comes from experiences in the Pacific , where everything is entirely different , where the tuna fish swim close to dolphins and where driftnets do cause a loss of other sea life besides what they are intended to catch . #% Mr President , my congratulations also to Mr Lange , who has shown real interest and enthusiasm in presenting his report and his amendments following on for Mr Robles Piquer . #% Tomorrow we must give this report a ringing endorsement , but we must also ensure that we do not tie our hands . #% I am not aware of a single Member State in the European Union that does not have a regulation with regard to thresholds for the funding of political parties . #% It is pointless to argue that a self-employed driver might be less fatigued than an employed driver . #% It is proposed in the financial perspective that Member States can increase the rate of modulation by up to 20 % . #% I am disappointed that many conservative MEPs stood with big business interests on this issue . #% This pays for a massive apparatus of State repression , including over 40 000 policemen whose sole job is to police the Internet for dissent . #% In this report we are presented with proposals to remove the barriers and distortions in the European Union post-trading environment , to create a level playing field between institutions , a common regulatory view and the development of rights of access and choice . #% Would he be in favour of referring it to our own legal services as the Commission is apparently about to do ? #% I say to him - because he does not have a great understanding of history - that historically , a ` Tory ' means somebody who is hunted : ` tóraidhe ' , a hunted one . #% I was re-reading the hearings documents on the appointment of the Commission and I was very pleased to see how far the Commission has gone towards the objectives the Commissioner set out at that time . #% We are aware that the Germans and the Japanese are sending their nuclear waste for processing to Sellafield because it is politically too uncomfortable for them to do it in their own countries because of concerns about this . #% The care a child receives in the earliest years will have an impact on him or her throughout life . #% Now I would like to turn to the second report on the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain for the adoption of a Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic laboratory activities . #% You gave some assurances earlier today at some meetings and perhaps you would clarify for all of us what exactly you said . #% I will explain as carefully as I can . #% This truly would be an enabling exercise . #% The economic and social development of islands is very important and requires special measures such as the flexibility requested in terms of competition regulations . #% Ultimately , these new structures will be able to help resolve cross-border disputes for aggrieved consumers within the European Union . #% It has been a fascinating and challenging experience for me to produce the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU 's policy on the matter . #% These courses were promoted by the local Leader group . #% That would be a difficult decision and I hope it will not be necessary but it is a constitutional requirement under Article 48 that this House should give an opinion before an IGC even though , regrettably , we have no right of assent after an IGC . #% But let us be clear . #% Clearly , this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries . #% Monitoring of Irish groundwater by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that there is no widespread contamination of individual aquifers . #% In 1995 over 400 cases of thyroid cancers were documented in children . #% It does not behove the future negotiations and discussions on behalf of Europe that , within this House , we can not even set down proper debating time to discuss real issues rather than abstract principles . #% I would like the Commission to give us a few answers on this . #% With these clarifications entered for the record I am happy to vote for Mr Haarder 's report . #% As I stated in my reply we are continuing to monitor the situation . #% So I could not support the overall report . #% Mr President , I , too , want to welcome and salute members of the McCartney family , who continue their crusade for justice outside Ireland and within it . #% The research is ambiguous . #% Any suggestion of renationalising spending within the common agricultural policy would also work to undermine the fabric of the CAP , which would fly in the face of the interests of European farmers and rural regions . #% In recent years the presence of both national and EU patrol vessels has more or less succeeded in enforcing the 2.5 kilometre length limit , except in the Mediterranean . #% You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty . #% This has put us all in a very difficult position , because we who are supporters of social dialogue , of protecting the rights of workers and of increasing the opportunities for employment of all the peoples in Europe want to ensure the best possible conditions for those most in need . #% 
Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission , and he will therefore be calling the shots - excuse the pun - concerning troop activities on the ground . #% But the reality is something different . #% The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism , their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse . #% We know that each year within the EU there are up to nine million vehicles that are scrapped on an annual basis . #% I salute their courage and bravery in endeavouring to get justice for their brother . #% I believe that the European Union can play a constructive role firstly in ending the violence in the Middle East and then putting in place structures whereby peace talks can recommence between the various factions . #% I hope very much that we will recognize that significant medical achievements can be achieved through biotechnology . #% The majority want assurances that Ireland 's traditional military neutrality will be fully protected and respected by all Member States of the European Union . #% There are two considerations . #% This will only happen if consumers can buy goods and services and be confident and secure that if problems arise they can be resolved easily . #% The agreement with Equatorial Guinea concerns tuna , but Equatorial Guinea is a well-known flag of convenience country . #% We must tackle this by improved forecasting of payment requirements , but I firmly reject any notion that global amounts could in any way be reduced . #% I should like to finish by saying that it is a job well done by the UN today , and I think it will add credibility to its stance on human rights issues . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mrs d'Ancona on her attempt to try and bring about a consensus in the House with regard to what is a very difficult subject , on which there are many divergent viewpoints and opinions in this Parliament . #% Never mind an injection from a doctor on duty for 16 or 18 hours as another speaker mentioned . #% We want to give serious consideration to the setting up of an energy programme agency with the task of producing the coherent energy strategy I mentioned . #% Madam President , I would like to add my voice to those who are calling for an emergency debate on the escalating crisis with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain . #% We have been told time and time again that stringent controls are in place , that accidents can not happen and that fail-safe systems are in place and then when anything happens , we are told it is the fault of the workers . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I shall be brief . #% If we get , as expected , an increase as a result of conciliation more money will , of course , be asked for next year . #% Seldom have I seen a greater degree of unanimity on the need for reform of the sheep and goat sector . #% We need to facilitate cooperation between SMEs and research institutes , promoting IPR ( Intellectual Property Rights ) and technology transfer . #% There is a need to revise the regulation of the EGF to enable greater flexibility in the use of the resources provided , particularly with regard to the timeframe . #% The people within Europe today did not vote against more jobs , did not vote against better social protection , did not vote against better trade , did not vote against better Community development programmes , did not vote against giving more aid to the developing world , did not vote against protection for our environment , did not vote against ensuring sustainable development in fisheries and other industries . #% The economic crisis and the crisis in the dairy sector have affected these regions disproportionately in relation to most of the rest of Europe , and that is why these regions deserve some special attention . #% What new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective ? #% High-wire negotiations only lead to mistrust . #% The potentially very good ideas with which we started the current programme have proved to be misplaced . #% Liability looked as though it would be a big problem but , fortunately , it was overcome . #% The Kyoto Protocol is off life-support because the Russian Federation ratified it . #% For example , statistics from Ireland - the country that myself and Mr Mitchell represent - reveal a significant increase in such cases , with 70 children abducted from the state last year , and I understand that 16 of these cases have yet to be resolved . #% This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and , as our rapporteur has pointed out , is high-risk . #% Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union . #% Unlike those opposite we listened to the answers to questions about the future roles . #% It also deals with the issue of child soldiers . #% We still face a significant challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto protocol while , at the same time , promoting growth within our economies . #% The individuals concerned adhere to one or other religion , or have no religion , but their objectives are political , and the one common thing that unites them is their contempt for democracy and humanity . #% At a time when markets are volatile , it can be the cost of a prospectus that would put someone off even trying to raise additional capital . #% It is high time that the European Union took the rights of children seriously , as they constitute over 40 % of our population but have no standing or status in European policies or ideas , except in the words we use to express our will to protect them . #% This may be a statistical aberration or it may be a situation where , for one reason or another , a greater number of the applications are for male workers . #% You only have to look at the financial situation right throughout the European Union at the moment to see that we have a terrible problem here and one that is not going to be easy to address . #% There is an awful lot to be said for this report . #% This is an old story . #% Even Mr Lamy would have to admit that it is difficult to have a more liberalised trade than that ! #% It is time we realised that we have to maintain fish stocks . #% For example , enormous amounts of money have been put into university-level students but no money into early intervention for children experiencing learning difficulties , to give them hope of reaching college or getting a job and not having a life of dependency . #% I will come to these shortly . #% The European Parliament must and should use these new powers to push forward an even stronger legislation in the area of environmental control . #% In Ireland , social spending cuts provide money to fuel economic growth . #% It makes no sense to me whatsoever to be reluctant to promote that . #% Enough about ` stupid ' energy . #% Its roar is an offence in my view to our many long term unemployed and to our young people who get no job start at all . #% You had more money at your disposal than anyone in Irish history , yet the Irish health system remained an under-funded disgrace , with long waiting lists for the simplest operations and patients crammed into hospital hallways every weekend . #% We need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation , but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is . #% What is happening here is that , by refusing to allow people to speak in this Parliament , by refusing to ensure that people abide by the Treaties and constitution of this Parliament and of the European Union , we are failing to fulfil our duty to set an example to people . #% We could have improved the marine environment considerably and at the same time , we could provide , at least for the future , a better livelihood and greater profits for fishermen . #% We have brought the document as far as we can with the Commission , but I would say that , if we vote for it today , you must immediately instruct our Committee on Constitutional Affairs to take up the question of delineating the rules in the House that will make it easier for rapporteurs to make requests either of their chairmen or of the other bodies named in this document . #% At the moment , it is a hugely politically-charged issue . #% They are less transparent and less democratic and often lead to temporary misunderstandings , especially when negotiations are conducted - as they inevitably are - in only one language . #% I should like to ask you , Sir , through your good offices , to see whether you could get it put on to the agenda , because this could be a very important sector for the creation of growth , both in employment and economic terms , and would actually stop jobs leaving the European Union . #% Mr President , I should like to thank and congratulate all the rapporteurs . #% In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents - it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents . #% It is vitally important that there be a strong vote for this particular resolution . #% The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity . #% The blanket of secrecy has been lifted . #% in writing . - Mr Lehne has proposed an own-initiative report proposing a Council Regulation that aims to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to facilitate cross-border transfers within the Community of the registered office of a company formed in a Member State of the Community . #% 
Are we doing Parliament justice ? #% The UN estimates that five to six thousand children die unnecessarily each month due to sanctions , even after the UN food for oil programme . #% These funds will alleviate the obvious infrastructural deficit that occurs in regions like mine and indeed in other regions that are lagging behind in Europe . #% They are restricted from operating outside their local geographic area and provide mainly small amounts of credit for low-income members and for those in financial difficulty . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome this cross-party resolution calling for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit held captive since 2006 by the military wing of Hamas . #% All Member States within the Union will retain the right to appoint one member to the Commission until 27 countries become full members of the Union , and even at that stage , positions in the Commission will be distributed between all Members on a rotation basis . #% Since I am responsible to the Committee on Budgetary Control for animal products , I felt it my duty to insert that amendment . #% The accusation the Commissioner made here that it is for people in favour of abolition and that we who are against it want to support the hidden subsidies to the alcohol , tobacco and travel industries is not true . #% A third area that I wish to focus on is the risk of creating new illiterates or new gaps between those people who have computer and electronic skills and those who do not . #% My own group has tabled a number of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage . #% Such a declaration represents a misinterpretation of the outcome of conciliation , where there was a clear if implicit intention to allow stricter national measures on the basis of Article 95 ( 10 ) . #% Let us be sure that technologically we are able to replace with a safer product , as far as the environment is concerned , what we are about to ban . #% If we could develop a single policy , if we could pool our resources and if we could achieve that target of 0.7 % , we would have something like EUR 70 billion to dispense throughout the world . #% On a point of order , Mrs Jackson 's question No 67 should have been taken with this . #% Europe needs to set an example if it is to insist on other parts of the world following its lead . #% Mr President , I must say that I can not help being somewhat bemused by the suggestion from Mr Giansily about what Mr Giscard d'Estaing would like . #% Mr President , as regards the Miguélez Ramos report the Verts/ALE Group considers that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine environment are of fundamental importance to the common fisheries policy . #% Amendment No 25 by Mr Novo Belenguer and others correctly represents this position and I will be glad to support it . #% What has happened to the goals and the timetables that were clearly set out ? #% I should like to compare that with the audit report on the same TAO . #% We expect the European Union to continue negotiations , maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round . #% After the redundancies - and these were forced , not voluntary , because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement of workers ' conditions - the vacancies arising from the forced redundancies were filled by mostly foreign workers , many on half the minimum wage for Ireland . #% We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo , and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention . #% I can not understand the priority it has been given , but I accept that there is a general need to have harmonisation at upper safe levels . #% I want to hear from the Council today what role it feels it is prepared to accord to this House in terms of the scrutiny and accountability of issues which may be intergovernmental but which can not stand on one pillar alone ? #% The call for an independent inquiry circles around the fact that there is considerable belief that an inquiry by the RUC into the death of Mrs Nelson will not be as rigorous as it should be because of the evidence that suggested that she feared very much for her life and for quite a long time believed that her life was in serious danger . #% I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on steering this package , which was not entirely unanimous , through the Commission so skilfully . #% I shall forward to you the letter from the FrontLine organisation urging you to demand that the Colombian authorities release immediately the members of Fensuagro in the absence of any valid legal charges , and ensure that lawful trade union organisations can operate free from intimidation . #% This will mean that electric and electronic waste will have to be collected and recycled instead of dumped - as in my own country - with negative effects on the environment . #% I would love to have somebody at the head of that Union who is and was a politician , who was part of different ideologies , who recognised the errors of his ways in his youth , who came forward and changed those ways to reflect what was most needed . #% The Union has , over the last months and years , infringed on people 's very basic rights , which are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights . #% It is an exceptional measure for Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% It is vitally important that , if this aid is forthcoming , it is properly coordinated and channelled to those who need it most . #% Intensive negotiations will continue under the Irish presidency between now and 17 June , with a view to finalising the provisions of this new Treaty . #% It is genuinely felt that the European Union has not responded comprehensively and could improve its policy in this area . #% I regard myself as a citizen of the world . #% They look to us to provide and guarantee safety and to ensure that employed and self-employed drivers are protected by the law from being driven into bad health and , perhaps , an early death from overwork . #% The Irish electorate has the right to know what the consequences of the Treaty are for the people of Ireland and Europe as a whole , including candidate countries . #% I made it very clear that I am obliged to abstain from giving an assessment or commentary on statements made outside formal Council meetings . #% Different criteria must be applied to those wishing to enter the European Union on economic grounds . #% Ireland has a lot to do in this particular area and anything that can help us to collect our minds and deliver -- as we must as a nation -- is to be welcomed . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the guiding principles of this directive , namely the safety of the consumer and the single market . #% With Aarhus these situations should not be happening in Ireland . #% It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock . #% They have progressed greatly in the recent past in changing laws , in amending systems that are decades old , to try and bring about a more realistic approach . #% Mr President , I wish to speak on the stability pact on behalf of the ELDR Group . #% I know these are early days , which is a genuine caveat for anything we say after what has been a very short 18-month review period . #% The police have all too often been reluctant , unable , or unwilling to actually start looking for these children until tragically sometimes it is too late . #% However , the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives . #% There is no doubt that unemployment is the major challenge that faces us in the next decade , and frankly in relative terms Europe is bad at creating jobs . #% To focus on trafficking only as crime means sidelining the support and services needed by the victims of trafficking . #% If these prove to be true , then Israel itself and its army are as guilty of acts of terrorism as those who plan , support and carry out suicide bombings . #% They also have some specific industrial applications in products as wide-ranging as microchips , fire-fighting foams , chromium plating and hydraulic fluids used in aviation . #% When you try and bring the different players together you can achieve a result that nobody thought possible . #% The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union . #% Some people today have mentioned women 's rights within Iraq . #% In fact , 1 1/2 million cattle must be exported every year , both as beef and live cattle . #% On the one hand we are calling for effective cooperation to combat drug barons and on the other we are turning the report into a charter for prisoners , with scant reference to the needs and rights of the victims of crime . #% There has been a unity of purpose and conviction from the beginning of my involvement - and I know that that goes back many years before I joined this Parliament last summer . #% They have also found a transport vessel , flagged in Panama and owned in Japan , both contracting parties to ICAT by the way , which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize . #% I thank in particular the Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland , His Excellency Mr Elias Nathan , who has publicly appealed for mercy on behalf of this mother . #% My understanding is that the European Commission initiated proceedings against the Irish Government with respect to this vessel and that these proceedings have now been withdrawn . #% Funding is a core issue and there must be agreement on the financial perspective . #% The resolution is also right to point out that , in trying to restore public order , it is vitally important that human rights are not violated . #% They think that by repeatedly swearing allegiance to that which voters , when permitted , have repudiated , they will somehow resuscitate it . #% Frankly , if we are to give these coastal communities a chance to survive , there is only one probable long-term answer : get tough , bring in quantitative restrictions . #% 
There have been controversies during your Presidency and I agree with Enrique Barón Crespo that you indeed had the courage of your convictions . #% I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world . #% This , colleagues , is not the sexiest title on this week ' s agenda , perhaps , but it is directly linked to the future of our planet and to the possibility of even more devastating weather events , mass movements of people and crop failure . #% I therefore dissociate myself , on behalf of the victims in my country , from the eulogy to a confederate of world terrorism . #% Europe needs to reform its economies , and all countries should do that . #% There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes . #% We need to look at opportunities to give people in the developing world ownership of their development , for example , and specifically to the promotion of land ownership for individuals , families and communities . #% In conclusion , I would like to acknowledge the fact that the supervisory board called for by Parliament , has indeed been set up . #% Secondly , we need to ensure that , whatever tools we introduce , we are able to respond rapidly and effectively to whatever crisis presents itself . #% It is not about diluting the availability of health services for women in need . #% Applications for asylum should be looked at without undue delay . #% The EU and European nations must be willing to give shelter and resources , too . #% We abdicate some of our own individual rights and freedoms in the interests of the common good to make sure that our world , our countries , our towns are better and safer places . #% We must harness the field of science to deliver rapid and affordable solutions today . #% The fight against unemployment must be put on a par with attainment of EMU . #% A proper UN force is needed and it is needed quickly with a proper mandate . #% As other speakers have mentioned , it has a very unusual clause to the effect that the Council should delay the implementation of this decision until the EU Court of Justice has issued its decision on the case brought by certain French fishermen . #% The consumer must be able to see at a glance the certificate of origin which is the assurance of product safety . #% I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and , in particular - not today , but perhaps over a certain period - to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knock-on effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone . #% However , I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee on Development - Members who did not allow pressure to divide us , across all groups , and who , in the end , carried the day . #% This Parliament has a central role to play in this and must take on board its responsibilities , but the Council and the Commission must give us greater cooperation . #% We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets . #% However , it will probably be the corporations , rather than the people , which will benefit from this , and many of them will not even be owned by nationals . #% Commissioner Lamy gave that undertaking . #% I have been assured by Commission officials that negotiations for third country fisheries agreements are based on information provided by this committee . #% What is this plan I am talking about and whose outlines are becoming more distinct as things progress ? #% Under Lisbon , this agreement requires the approval of this House and I would guess from my colleagues that the way the agreement is developing , it will receive a cold reception . #% This current second revision of the agreement is a great opportunity to address the root causes of the financial , climate change , food and energy crises , and to learn from past mistakes , bringing meaningful changes to the Cotonou framework , as well as enhancing ACP unity , cohesion and solidarity . #% There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly . #% In my region of Northern Ireland there are many beautiful beaches , several of which proudly boast blue flag status . #% Some of them have been mentioned already : proposals for satellite tracking systems , ventilation and temperature monitoring , stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries . #% It is important that we have this period of deep reflection . #% Parliament has been at the forefront of promoting these measures . #% Based upon my experiences there , I would like to make a few points in the context of the Fava report and the Commission communication , both of which I warmly welcome . #% The ODA quota must be even stricter than in the current DCI . #% We need a precautionary approach but not a preventive one . #% However , we have to accept that there is absolutely no chance of influencing the United States when we are so dependent on them . #% His only recourse is to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . #% These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe . #% I think that , whilst the exercise of creating the integrated control system has been an immense project , it will prove its worth in the European Union in ensuring that the money we vote for agriculture goes to the right people and that we can account for all of it . #% When I return from Brussels or wherever , be it a Thursday evening or Friday morning , the greatest welcome I get is from my collection of dogs - at least in terms of the noise they make and the length of time . #% Plans are now being rewritten for Ireland and are practically ready for resubmission and so it is likely that this case will be dropped . #% In the UK and Ireland there is cross-party support for the Irish peace process , even though from time to time parties have been critical of details . #% This House has expressed its concerns quite recently about the continued detention of these people without charge or trial and has urged that they be given a fair and open hearing with the right to choose their own defence counsel . #% We now have an opportunity to encourage diversification . #% We added another EUR 400 million in relation to animal health measures . #% UNFICYP was another success , as was the operation of the UN force which assisted and oversaw the end of the Iraq-Iran war . #% Mr President , I am really delighted , in this plenary part - session of Parliament , to again be addressing you on the subject of Malta 's accession to the European Union . #% In fact , in many scenarios they are treated as inferior beings to the rest of society . #% The Commission must modify its draft agreement text to ensure that European citizens ' data protection rights are protected . #% I know you can not join us in Punta del Este , but I would ask that you make it very clear to those honourable people who will be representing you there that you would like the precedent you created last December to continue . #% Member States ' company law allows for two different systems of company management . #% It is recognition by all the key EU institutions of the political importance of assisting farmers , their families and the rural communities in which they live . #% Colleagues will remember that , some weeks ago in the European Parliament building in Brussels , the President of Parliament invited a number of Nobel Prize winners to speak on the future of Europe and on areas and issues that they are concerned with . #% Thus , harmonisation of tax would rob Member States of the right to adjust their tax regimes to suit their own needs and would bestow across Europe yet another stultifying one-size-fits-all suppression of national initiative . #% Also the proposal for a multinational approach to legal deposit may also run into linguistic difficulties . #% Is that what we have ended up with at the table now , in giving too much too soon ? #% I should like to express my deep gratitude to all my colleagues in this Parliament for their unanimous support for this peace project because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country . #% It is very close to the heart of the people of Ireland who , unfortunately , recently rejected the Nice Treaty , precisely because they misunderstood to some extent the nature of the European Union and what we are attempting to do in relation to the Rapid Reaction Force . #% FIFA has stated that there is a deplorable trend in the increased level of racist attacks in Europe . #% As far as I can see , no distinction has been made , either by the Member States , or by the EU legislator , between horses raised for the purpose of meat production and horses raised for recreational purposes . #% I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved . #% In addition , more trade negotiations and more trade union negotiations took place at a national level and , over seven different years , there were four different programmes to guarantee the rights of workers and the right to participation of workers ' representatives . #% He is , of course , outraged as we are in this House at what is happening there . #% The provisions of the Treaty of Nice do not change that . #% The number of `` no '' voters in Ireland has not grown . #% 
However , it is not essential for the IGC to conclude in the first half of next year : it is of far greater importance that the Member States use the IGC to confront the issues which are of general concern to our electorates and to lay the foundations for a successful enlargement of the Union to the East , even if this requires an additional six or twelve months . #% I welcome the broad support for this urgency but , on behalf of my group , I would like to indicate that we strongly oppose the two amendments tabled by the Green Group . #% I would say that they reflect probably half -- being generous -- of what the real burden of the disease could actually be . #% It is regrettable , but it must be said that there are legitimate concerns about the role of the security forces . #% The Member refers to a particular case in relation to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and Freedoms , which the Court ruled on . #% While there could be certain aspects of Parliament 's adopted report that ECR MEPs do not support , we strongly believe that the legal basis of this regulation should be changed to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process and additionally , that it should be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment . #% Mr President , as this matter was agreed just prior to the vote I want to be quite clear about the separate vote , because the complete voting list was only available this morning . #% We had to try to achieve a level playing field between European airlines and the airlines of the United States , which then received even greater support than our airlines . #% Mr President , despite the very welcome efforts of the Commission and indeed of the United Nations , it is difficult to display optimism in this dark period . #% On behalf of my group I would like to make a few brief points on this area . #% However , those people without skills seeking to integrate into the workplace have little or no chance of taking up remunerative and rewarding employment unless they learn a new trade or a different work practice . #% So , while we welcome this excellent report today , and indeed commend the work of the Agency , we all need to be vigilant in our own countries to ensure that workers ' rights are upheld . #% It is indispensable and each part of it has a core , indispensable role and responsibility and benefits by the very fact of the three parts working well together . #% In particular , it highlights the necessity for increased use of regulation to ensure that all Member States take action at the same time . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her lengthy reply , much of which I have heard before . #% I have to say that the response , not only from the government , but also from the people , was heroic . #% Is there any further pressure that the Council and the European Union would consider putting on the Iraqi authorities in an effort at least to get information as to how many of these people are alive , who they are , what is the state of their health , when they are going to be released and , indeed , how many have died . #% It would be better all round if the investigations were to be conducted in a completely independent manner so that it could be seen to be objective and impartial by all sections of the community . #% Secondly , I would like to thank the EU Commission personnel involved in election observation . #% Not all the European Union Member States have experienced terrorism since the end of the Second World War , but a significant number have . #% These appliances are often wrongly connected by householders to surface-water drains leading directly to rivers rather than to so-called foul drains , which channel the run-off to water treatment plants , thereby causing unnecessary pollution in water courses . #% We can not afford to live in a time warp . #% Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's views in relation to the importance of highlighting this aspect , which is particularly important in Irish society today . #% in writing . - I support this resolution which calls , inter alia , on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the Goldstone report and demands the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law , including alleged war crimes , and urges all sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence , impartiality , transparency , promptness and effectiveness , in line with United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/64/L .11 . #% I can support the general content of the common position , with that one reservation . #% This decision , which was taken by Bertie Ahern and the other finance ministers in 1991 , will have drastic consequences for thousands of workers across the European Union . #% So it is important to remove the older animals . #% He clearly tried to give the impression that those opposing this were just spokespeople for the industries that produce food supplements . #% The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers ' responsibility . #% Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive . #% Those are the three principles we have in our peace process in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for his ongoing and diligent work on this issue which may not grab the headlines , but is of extreme importance to each and every one of the people that we represent here in this Parliament . #% Indeed , following disclosure of a reaction , a special contiguous testing programme for herds adjoining restricted herds is operated . #% Agriculture and forestry are the cornerstones of land use and the management of natural resources , and they serve at the same time as the basis for economic diversification there . #% If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future . #% There is little chance . #% The road map that they set out is that by the year 2025 the first cars will be in mass production , and that by 2035 they will be in widespread use across the US . #% There are question marks relating to silicon implants which have not been answered by studies to date , and I would urge further research on that . #% I would further argue for a strict rather than a relaxed admission policy so as to protect the rights of third country nationals by outlining clearly the necessary criteria for admission . #% We have spoken about it many times in Parliament : in 1997 the Council joint action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children paved the way for Member States to review the relevant criminal law so as to ensure the criminalisation of certain behaviours and to encourage judicial cooperation . #% We must do more to advance the Lisbon strategy so as to ensure the Union becomes the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% Out of over 110 000 applications received at the EPO in 2001 , 16 000 dealt with inventions in computer-implemented technologies . #% Among the most important goals achieved is the entry of women into the labour market . #% I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue . #% Can I just simply ask the Commission : firstly , how would it comment on the provision of the dispute settlement mechanism and how will this operate in practice ? #% This proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the European Union . #% Our minister , who was crying over what had happened at the weekend and saying that it was one of his worst fears , did not think this meeting was important enough to attend . #% I say to Mr Bush : pull my other leg ! #% Perhaps the President-in-Office could reassure us on this point . #% Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years . #% Financial resources must be made available to ensure that the relief programmes continue and that appropriate medicinal and food supplies reach the refugees in need . #% We want evidence that you can listen and understand what your role is , what our role is and what the roles of of the Council of Ministers , of lobbyists and of members of the directorates-general are . #% I spoke earlier about the great success of rural development in the town of Tullamore but , in case you think all is wonderful in rural Ireland , in terms of broadband penetration , we are unfortunately languishing in 17th place in the European Union . #% Now that she has returned , she might withdraw her statement . #% It is no accident that when the French Republic gave the people of the United States a gift to celebrate 100 years of that great republic , that they called that statue ` Liberty ' : no accident either that her extended arms should carry a torch of freedom . #% Not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped . #% Yet Taiwan 's progress in joining the world 's community in other spheres is blighted by the People 's Republic of China . #% An intelligent policy to disseminate technological innovation would be one of the skills to counteract this process of polarisation . #% Also , it ignores the fact that in certain Member States there are very fair electoral systems . #% As far as Parliament 's work is concerned , however , I am satisfied . #% My question is the same as Mrs Riis-Jørgensen 's . #% However , if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year , we will have to revert to our previous approach . #% He should not be given refuge in the European Union under any circumstances . #% If we had that ECU 7 billion today to devote to the rural development aspects of our agricultural policy , it could be put to use to achieve social and economic objectives which are closer to the hearts of most people in this Parliament . #% Sugar has other uses besides sweets . #% 
In conclusion , we should facilitate enterprises which create new jobs in rural areas , regardless of scale . #% I have to say that talking is no longer enough : it is action we need on global stocks and volatility in the market , and until you start to tackle that problem , you will not solve the problem . #% For a child , abuse , whether it is at the hand of a lecherous adult or the Internet , becomes a psychological millstone that blights the child for life . #% My own Member State solemnly declared last year at the United Nations General Assembly that it would reach the 0.7 % of GDP by the year 2010 . #% In relation to the remainder of his question , each presidency would probably look back at particular issues it was particularly successful in advancing . #% Some of these initiatives have been more successful than others , but in general , it remains the same social groups who make up the overwhelming majority of third-level students . #% Let me reiterate and emphasise that the area known as the Irish Box is a rich fishing area with a high concentration of juvenile fish and spawning grounds . #% I have a question for Mr Mandelson on the same issue , so perhaps he might oblige and answer the question privately ? #% As a senior British trade union general secretary said , it is a significant step forward and offers a chance to build a substantial foundation . #% But there is no way out of this impasse unless the United Nations takes the leading role across a range of political activities . #% It is a matter of regret for me that in my own country we have a proposed disability bill , intended to implement the framework directive , which refuses to accept a rights-based approach for people with disabilities . #% This is all good progress . #% I would be in favour of looking at an innovation reserve with the appropriate procedures of decentralization and subsidiarity . #% There is a similar lack of openness in the so-called independent review of submitted projects to this programme in Euratom . #% I am satisfied that some sensitive issues of national concern will remain the preserve of individual Member States . #% In my own country fluorosis is becoming an increasing dental problem , particularly in teenagers . #% In essence , these declarations spell out in clear and unequivocal terms the fact that Ireland 's policy of neutrality is fully protected . #% With regard to ethical dilemmas in biotechnology , we need to take these , and the efforts to respond to ethical concerns in funding EU research very seriously . #% Finally , regarding company law on mergers and takeovers , the presidency has done a wonderful job in fashioning a difficult compromise . #% Mr President , with regard to the speakers to whom you have given the floor during this debate , I object to the lack of balance among the different Member States . #% Furthermore , the return to US unilateralism - especially evident in its perceived intention to extend the war on terrorism to Iraq - displays contempt for our role in international affairs . #% Would not the world be a different place if , in our shaping of policy and legislation , in our negotiations and decision-making , we as politicians could keep these words in mind . #% Given the sensitivity , the Bureau , the House and the Conference of Presidents should be given a detailed account of this breakdown in the system . #% At the moment , Germany has a massive surplus in its balance of trade with the rest of the Union - something like 25 billion . #% Every single action taken is not taken in an exclusive format or by one person , but goes through a host of motions and a series of individuals and organisations before a final decision is reached . #% Action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers . #% Mr President , my predecessor , Mr Philip Whitehead MEP , would have been proud to have spoken on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection . #% However , there needs to be a major rethink about fleet policy . #% We have given Greenland a deal that it had no right to expect , seeing that it voluntarily walked away and did not accept in good faith that it would have been fairly treated within the Union . #% Obviously , serious reforms are needed and will have to be pursued . #% Greater protection of the environment is , of course , important and the European Union has made a start in the right direction in this regard by finalizing the SAVE III programme which is designed to support measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that very detailed reply . #% As we know , complementary medicine is practised by thousands of people each year throughout Europe and it has been discussed at length at European level over recent years . #% Drugs are the hard currency for weapons and are funding terrorism . #% But the truth is -- and I am indebted to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for this gem of information , which I think we in this Chamber probably all know about -- there is no recognised scientific test to differentiate organic and conventional produce . #% In that regard , has the Council yet discussed and acted upon the disgraceful fact that three convicted international terrorists , who are fugitives from justice in Colombia , are now enjoying sanctuary in a European Union Member State , namely the Republic of Ireland ? #% In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes . #% Mr President , while the European Parliament has no formal role in the ratification procedure , I am pleased that , as the elected representatives of 25 Member States of the European Union , we are having this debate today , at a point in time when the ratification procedure has just got under way at parliamentary level and is just about to get under way at referendum level . #% Because we want to make injury surveillance more comprehensive we include mention of risk-taking behaviour , drugs and alcohol , gender considerations , social and environmental condition . #% It would be the greatest obscenity to do this work , discover the products and then find that those who need them can not use them . #% It is a lie that market forces are guaranteeing efficient behaviour . #% This possibility was removed and I can not understand why . #% Our tourism , and in particular our agri-tourism , are closely linked to the countryside . #% I do not think it is at all anti-European to make the point that the Olympic Games give great national pride to the nation states that participate in them . #% Today is the tenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia as it then was . #% Last year , several TACs were set higher than ICES advised . #% Its crimes have been outlined by previous speakers so I will not go over them . #% More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990 . #% Fortunately , this is not having any significant impact on the attitude of Irish voters to the Treaty of Nice . #% If you read the name to the House , then I trust and hope that the people who are accusing me of voting twice will apologize and withdraw . #% Commissioner , you have done it again : having given the Commission the ` two fingers ' when you were an Irish minister , you have now outraged the Swedish population with a similar gesture towards their social partnership model as well as the European Parliament today . #% I urge you to support my amendments . #% Fisheries , unlike any other industry , depend so much on seasonality and weather factors . #% This ban will apply to new vehicle types in 2011 and to all new vehicles in 2017 . #% We in Ireland were spared the worst because of our geographical location and , in no small measure , because of the extreme exemplary precautions taken by the Irish authorities - a fact referred to in today 's report . #% The Israeli government must end its blockade of Gaza and there must be an immediate resumption of aid to Palestine , and support for the government of national unity . #% Mr Prodi is also reported as saying that any future amendments or revisions of the Treaty should be by parliament or government rather than by popular referendum . #% Member States will be allowed on an exceptional basis to opt out of the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on established national practices . #% Categorising beef as steers , bullocks or heifers will not do anything to allay the fears of the consumer . #% It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions . #% Linguistic and cultural diversity is not about defining or redefining boundaries ; it underpins the cultural strength of our enlarging European Union . #% Any reform of the CAP should be geared towards preserving and encouraging the continuation of the family farm as the foundation of the European agricultural sector . #% The Irish Labour Party does not support the introduction of CCCTB . #% I would love to see this debate taken side by side with the debate tomorrow on national allocation plans in relation to our Kyoto targets . #% It recommends that the State Parties to the Geneva Conventions ( which includes Ireland ) should prosecute those responsible for these policies and their implementation . #% There seem to be a lot of vacant seats . #% 
I certainly recognise that the greatest environmental disasters occur as a consequence either of irresponsibility or the actions of those who are driven by the profit motive , irrespective of the consequences . #% While I agree - and no one disagrees in this House - that we must foster a culture of voluntary donations as the norm , as the ethos , in all our Member States , I plead with this House not to specifically exclude paid donations . #% If not NATO there was nothing . #% in writing . - The effects of climate change are being felt now : temperatures are rising , icecaps and glaciers are melting and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more intense . #% This applies not only to women but also to men . #% There may be some sense behind the suggestions , but it is not at all clear to us . #% The Intergovernmental Conference must prepare for the expansion of the European Union to include the former communist countries in Eastern Europe . #% Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined , prescriptive set of rules . #% I note that the report on the one-stop-shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis . #% As Mr Cunha has just said , the volume of trade alone would make us significant . #% We need legal certainty in the field of employment , both for employers and employees . #% Renationalising part of the CAP could only have led to the ultimate disintegration and fragmentation of the common agricultural policy itself . #% They only have one aspiration - you could hardly call it a hope because it is so long-term - and that is that the people in Northern Ireland will find an accommodation with each other . #% The Commission 's original proposal provided for a derogation whereby the design right could no longer be invoked against such use after a period of three years . #% Even low levels of exposure to radiation could be poisoning the human gene pool , wreaking damage on future generations . #% I simply can not understand how , after all the years of experience , this continues to be the case . #% Is it any coincidence that this protocol was attached during the Spanish presidency and forced through ? #% Electromagnetic fields ( EMF ) are a matter of direct concern to EU citizens . #% This could mean that the reprocessing shipments that have normally gone to Sellafield-THORP will be discontinued , thereby raising questions about the economic viability of that plant . #% Mr President , Commissioner , you have listed a lot of very worthy projects . #% However , there is a very firm majority in Parliament who are in favour of a European involvement , not just in the exchange of best practices or the cooperation procedures , which we agree with , but also in utilising some of the previous programmes which existed in the past ; in particular the Poverty I and Poverty II programmes and the way that they dealt with the problems using a bottom-up approach . #% The vast majority of Parliament would have supported that position because it was a very fair and reasonable compromise . #% Firstly , we need to agree upon a set minimum safety net for all sectors which are vulnerable to price fluctuations . #% They are not the result of the 1992 reform but due to unpredictable circumstances which include BSE , the collapse of the Russian economy and , in some cases , the renationalisation of food markets . #% This is the lives of our citizens . #% In the Reform Treaty , which is a very prominent subject of debate in my country at the present time , the European Union has outlined measures which will see the 27 Member States combating climate change , united together . #% I urge Catherine Ashton during her upcoming visit to the region to press the Israeli and Palestinian authorities , including those in Gaza , for the release of Gilad Shalit and of Palestinian children and PLC members and to ensure their safe and early return to their families . #% This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest . #% I have one specific question for Commissioner Fischler . #% So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living . #% We have to try and deal with the hopelessness that motivates them . #% At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments . #% In relation to the election results , as I have already said , we welcome the initial assessment but we will consider the final reports on the conduct of the elections from the international monitors before we make up our minds on the fairness or otherwise of the elections . #% In conclusion , I sincerely hope that this lengthy exercise will bring about some very tangible results . #% It is unenforceable , and that makes an ass of the law . #% Washington 's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay . #% I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today . #% Why were we testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific last year ? #% Frankly , in relation to the specific topic I believe the Commissioner has at least indicated in principle the direction of his response . #% The Irish situation is an excellent case study in point . #% If a small operator were part of a consortium , it would have a greater chance of continued work . #% While I welcome this Parliament ' s contribution , I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the European Commission over the years , and in particular former Presidents , President Delors , our colleague and former President , Jacques Santer , and now President Prodi who , in his statement yesterday , committed himself to the continuation of funds towards the various programmes in Northern Ireland . #% Finally , we have tabled an amendment introducing the principle of positive discrimination in R & D for the poorer regions . #% Would the powers that be send the message , so there is no misunderstanding : tomorrow we would like them present . #% Pandering to the same prejudices again could well result in a second failure and consequently leave Ireland in a semi-detached relationship with our EU partners , and that would be disastrous . #% Those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the Constitution 's own most ardent and more honest proponents . #% I am glad that we will now have a further opportunity to deal with this in the September plenary session , on the basis of a UPE Group oral question . #% While laudable , this leads to one major gap : the recommended increases in research in nanotechnologies are preceding legislation to regulate these technologies . #% In today 's Times newspaper UEFA and FIFA are clearly indicating that this will lead to lower transfer fees , which has a knock-on impact , particularly for smaller clubs in my area . #% It is noncontroversial . #% All you need to do is swop McCarthy and Hatzidakis with Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and then we can follow on logically . #% The other is economic . #% Openness , transparency and accountability are key building blocks to building a European demos . #% I should like to say to Mr Prodi how welcome he is here today . #% It is , on the one hand , necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% As fish stocks are decreasing in abundance faster than the fishing fleets chasing them , the future does not look bright for either the fish or the coastal communities and the people depending on the fishing industry for a living . #% It is important that we consider the needs of peripheral European countries who encounter several geographic barriers that depend on a strong transport network to supply their countries , and for their economic growth . #% This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date . #% Since you invite oral questions for Commissioners for parts one , two and three , why is it that after the second half hour we did not revert to the first question of part three ? #% It is unacceptable in any state of the Union that an organization should impose sectarian intimidation of citizens . #% What would happen then if someone fleeing from persecution were to seek asylum or help from the EU embassy if it did not suit the EU 's interests to support him or her ? #% That charted the way forward in terms of bringing about peace and stability not only between Israel and Palestine , but also amongst their neighbours , including Syria , Jordan , Iran , Egypt and Lebanon . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to keep an open mind . #% Twenty-two thousand children die each day , every day , a short plane journey from this building . #% Hence , the point I am making - and the Commission also shares this view - is that we need a pan-European system whereby a product authorised properly in one Member State can be used throughout the EU . #% Mr President , I am pleased that today 's debate has been framed as a joint debate on issues of food and feed safety . #% 
Three quarters of the world 's opium was produced in Afghanistan last year . #% This amendment was rejected by the House and therefore I abstained in the final vote . #% I fully support the aims of rural development but I firmly believe that direct payments are a key element in keeping alive small family holdings and maintaining rural communities right across Ireland . #% That is really unfortunate and a gross abdication of our duty to people all over the world . #% The European Parliament has worked hard in implementing legislation which reduces the use of CO2 gases . #% I would urge you to impress on the Commission and the Council that Israel must be persuaded to end its veto on the development of the Gaza Strip . #% Since 1999 , countries that obey the rules have been honouring Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1447/1999 , which required proportional , effective and dissuasive penalties with regard to serious infringements of the common fisheries policy . #% Countries on the periphery , such as Ireland , with extensive sea coasts must be supported at EU level in their efforts to track and intercept drug-smuggling . #% When Yasser Arafat was the leader of the Palestinian people , Israel said it could not deal with him , it could not negotiate with him . #% We reject this because any abuse of children is a criminal offence . #% I commend the rapporteur , Mr Whitehead , and all involved in producing this excellent report . #% Pesticides play an important role in these elements demanded by European consumers . #% Mr President , the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice is taking place at a defining moment in our relationship with the European Union . #% You only have to look at the UN reports on Bogota , whenever they are published , to find accounts of gross human rights violations . #% It is totally wrong that an opt-out is available on health and safety law , and important that it is ended as soon as possible . #% The value of domestic work is not included in our GDP calculations and , for that reason among others , domestic work is very often invisible and is certainly undervalued . #% The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for that response . #% Firstly , I wish to thank all my colleagues , in particular the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , for the cooperation we had during a long and difficult enough debate at times . #% The budget lines dealt with by my committee are the most complex of any committee . #% I and my group strongly believe that the convention method could be adopted . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to continue to champion this issue and emphasise it consistently in Göteborg , especially with a view to enabling the Irish to say `` yes '' to enlargement there . #% We , as Members of the European Parliament , should be demanding that people ' s freedoms and the right to privacy , as enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention and Article 6 of the EU Treaty , are protected and that people are not forced to live under permanent control where the possibility exists that every communication they make will be accessible to unknown forces . #% I agree with Mr Donnelly that the convergence achieved is a powerful recognition of what political will and shared political will can bring about . #% If there is to be a restructuring of the committees in Parliament let us not fall into the trap of thinking that an Environment Committee could possibly undertake to look at all the aspects of energy . #% From the point of view of consumers , the Liberal Group believes , subject to the observations I have already made , that consumers should be assured of quality and accessibility of public services and we respect and commend the principle of universality . #% Much of the criticism of the handling of the BSE crisis made within both committees of inquiry centred on the failure of Commission staff involved . #% Unfortunately , however , as with most new opportunities , these have been hijacked to a huge extent by people of criminal intent who use them for illicit means . #% Mr President , we all have to totally condemn the nuclear testing by both Pakistan and India , but we also have to look to ourselves - the responsibilities that the European Union holds and the fact that France , not so very long ago , carried out its nuclear tests despite opposition from right round the world . #% From an agricultural perspective , Mr Olsson has addressed the challenge of enlargement in a reasoned and practical way . #% I would like you to come back and tell us what reply I can give to the people who have written to me . #% I would refer Members in particular to Amendment No 22 dealing with Article 12 ( 1 ) which provides that there will not be universal charges for water where special social and other conditions apply . #% We welcome the breakthrough in a statute to establish an international criminal court as a permanent structure to bring to justice those charged with crimes against humanity and urge that the preparatory work proceed . #% This issue is of enormous importance and the Commission should have come forward with more concrete ideas , rather than referring to various proposals that have already been made by other people . #% I agree with the rapporteur that public pressure is needed to ensure adequate expenditure to promote mental health and to prevent mental illness . #% EU leaders have agreed to set the end of the year 2002 as the deadline for the EU 's internal preparations , notably the ratification of any institutional changes which are agreed at the future IGC . #% The second thematic issue is children 's rights . #% As one of my colleagues from Ireland mentioned , it can not be taken in isolation because of the amount that Ireland exports . #% Indeed , as a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I have come to expect representations from many organisations across the board . #% That is not to say that there are no philosophical differences anymore , but it is to argue that these differences are being redefined by the objective conditions of the modern world we live in . #% It is completely unjustifiable that this Parliament should vote to allow that situation to remain for 10 years . #% Since January 2000 , there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults . #% The risk that attempts may be made to counterfeit the euro currency when it begins to circulate in the form of coins and notes is very high . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to begin by congratulating Chancellor Klima and Mr Schüssel on completing the first ever Austrian presidency . #% Ireland has consistently emphasized the importance of the semi-integration of the ACP countries into the world economy and the compatibility of new trade arrangements with the World Trade Organization . #% The challenges that lie ahead are great , not just for the quality of life for those who reside in an increasingly urbanised Europe . #% I believe that each Member State should retain the right to nominate one member of the Commission or , at a minimum , ensure that there is an equality of representation on the Commission from both small and large states . #% The imbalance has been somewhat redressed by the public health competence given to us by the Maastricht Treaty . #% Mr President , the essentials have been covered , but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission . #% Unfortunately our minister has today ruled out any kind of independent inquiry into this . #% However , the report in no way affects the legislative programme , which is addressing such issues as traceability , labelling and liability . #% Mr President , first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers . #% Irish troops have a proud record of serving in peace-keeping and humanitarian missions abroad under the auspices of United Nations mandates and the Irish people want this to continue to be the case in the future . #% I welcome this first step in the process of expanding the Union into central and eastern Europe and I look forward to the opening of the negotiations with the rest of the countries who have applied for membership . #% I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the weaknesses identified in the various reports . #% It will be better still with the single currency and it will be good for all small Member States . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% We need to know immediately what kind of situation she is in . #% I am voting against this recommendation/common position because I believe it does not adequately address the technical issues involved . #% We will have to wait and see how it actually works in practice . #% It is horrifying to think that substances such as high-grade plutonium could get into the wrong hands , like those of terrorists and criminals ; it is appalling to think of the spectre of nuclear explosive devices being available to them . #% The European Union must promote a greater level of dialogue with America to streamline the rules governing the operating of the accountancy industry . #% Along with his fellow rapporteurs for the Europol package , they have endured a frustrating time negotiating the timescale and legality of the draft Council Decisions . #% Secondly , politically , we strongly welcome the green light which was given this week to Cyprus as part of that process . #% In mid-February Chief Inspector Laurence Williams said that he himself would pull the plug on the THORP reprocessing plant if his safety recommendations were not acted on . #% I strongly urge you to work on an Interinstitutional Agreement which involves the European Parliament in trade matters . #% 
Would the President agree with me that perhaps the additionality clause in the regulations needs to be looked at ? #% It is important to be realistic when we consider the number of issues that our organisation can address within its rules . #% Yes , the rest of the family are delighted - a quick `` Hi Mum '' , - a head goes up and you might get a hug and then back to the TV or whatever they were doing - but 20 minutes later the dogs are still running round in high excitement . #% On the other hand , I feel deep disappointment at the result of all the discussions , at the waste of work which went into drawing up more ambitious proposals , at the lost opportunities , at the lack of investment in Europe 's economy and at the failure to respond to the challenge to our economy from elsewhere in the world . #% There will be growing impetus for companies to invest and evolve in terms of research and development and substitution plans . #% That is part of what is wrong with our transport system . #% The main provisions of this directive include the following : the consumer will have a 14-day period before concluding a contract which will give that person time to compare various proposals and study the contract in detail before giving a final agreement ; the consumer will have a 14-day withdrawal period , 30 days for mortgage loans , life insurance and pensions , to renounce the contract without penalties and without giving reasons . #% There is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted , listened to , and be in the hands of people who have no right to them . #% It is for this reason that the original resolution of the European United Left Group calls for the logging industry to be in public ownership and under democratic control , crucially involving workers in the industry and the indigenous communities in the forests affected by logging . #% It has sought to use the crisis arising from the atrocities of 11 September to shake out the industry to ensure that companies that may or may not have survived in the normal course of economic operations are forced to close down . #% Consider , too , a Member State 's commitment in relation to the basic regulation which was reviewed last December : again , they took out the opportunity which was used by the Spanish in the past to ban driftnets . #% In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission . #% It is basically in the interests of the militarisation of Europe , which is not in the interests of people in the long term . #% Whatever emerges , there is a duty on the EU to continue to press for reform in Romania 's state residential institutions . #% in writing . - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel , with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen . #% The report also provides support for , among other things , a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with European policing and anti-fraud . #% I was interested to hear what Commissioner Van Den Broek said about the VAT situation being much clearer here , but , as the Commissioner is aware , there were other problems associated with some small industries and so on . #% Indeed , our amendments to the common position mean that a board can get fast-track approval in 14 days . #% Finally , as this is likely to be my last contribution in this House , I want to acknowledge the success of the European project . #% It is important that more money is available , but it is also important that we should seek here to enhance the socially-inclusive Europe citizens clearly desire . #% The anti-war movement has warned of these problems since the start of the war . #% ICES says that cod in the North Sea is at its lowest level since 1963 . #% Both myself and Mr Poignant had one major preoccupation - to make sure that our reports were not only complementary , but more importantly that they were not contradictory . #% The target in SAVE II is not ambitious ; 1.5 % increase year-on-year is not ambitious . #% Our choice was therefore limited , however regrettable . #% My final point relates to the call on the Commission to produce a regulation for a block exemption for services of general interest in the event that the European Court may find such support for services of general interest to be in breach of competition law . #% In fact they have negative effects on fish stocks , the marketing of non-human-consumption species , technical measures and so on . #% Would she also accept that regional development policies and fisheries policies should not be looked at in isolation , but in tandem ? #% One could argue that it could not get any worse and it should go into private hands . #% This is an important distinction which demonstrates that we are not supporting a shirking of responsibilities . #% I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency , and maybe other presidencies , when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union . #% From an Irish perspective , I believe that our cash changeover plan is moving very well . #% Leadership is needed on both sides , and that is not easy . #% Will the Commission take further action on the likely developments ? #% Amendments were adopted , however , which attempted to underline the fact that stricter national measures are allowed under single market measures , provided they are proportionate , non-discriminatory and not purely economic in nature . #% It may well do more harm than good . #% The European Parliament must profit from this occasion to clean up its own act . #% What is urgently required is a stronger policy of denial of EU funds and a facility to recoup them in respect of any company which relocates production to another Member State . #% A man has been unspeakably , brutally murdered and the perpetrators have been able to walk freely and have not yet been brought to justice . #% I am sorry for having gone on so long , but would like to sum up very briefly with the old saying ` give a man a fish and you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% In Ireland , it is approximately 15 % and this has major implications for women 's standard of living , for their families and their quality of life . #% Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that , unfortunately , such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States . #% I am delighted to hear so many references here today to the Cork Declaration . #% The victims are the real prisoners of terrorism ; the perpetrators all too often walk free . #% A consolidated tax base would have the effect of placing the fiscal policy of Member States into a straight jacket . #% Those without fishing waters or enough fishing waters of their own , must not be allowed to plunder those whose fishing grounds have already suffered at the hands of the so-called expert conservationists , who have been proved wrong on many occasions . #% Any future debate here should follow the debate in our own country . #% Mr President , I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency and Commissioner Nielson for the very fine statements that they made here this morning , and to my Parliamentary colleagues for the very enlightening statements they have made as well . #% Our public services should be seen as mechanisms for social protection . #% Northern Ireland , where I come from , is a much better place than it was ten years ago . #% This approach is followed very successfully in the South Pacific on tuna and there is no reason whatsoever that it should not apply here . #% It is my belief that in many parts of the developing world impunity is the single biggest contributing factor to continued human rights abuses , because people believe that they will not be punished or held to account for the horrific actions they either sanction or take themselves . #% We need industry to go out and sell renewable energy . #% In the potentially dangerous construction industry , accidents are much more likely to occur when people are required to work such long hours . #% At least 62 Japanese-built flags-of-convenience longliners will be scrapped by the end of 2002 . #% Perhaps you will take those on board in items 2 and 3 of the motion . #% It makes it virtually impossible for us and is not a fair procedure . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his tremendous work . #% Mr President , I am a lawyer and I also worked in the insurance industry , but I did not expect to be leading the Socialists on this matter this evening . #% It will certainly consolidate democratic structures in Europe , while at the same time strengthening the economy of an expanding European Union . #% It incites women to a pursuit of perfection with consequences like eating disorders . #% As Mrs Ahern said , some improvements have been made , but the reality is that we have to take into account the experience in the United States which has created multi-million and multi-billion dollar legal suits by large companies against small companies , which have stifled innovation , prevented new invention and prevented job creation . #% If you had a scenario where more science equals more growth , more consumption of natural resources , more unemployment for technological reasons and an increasing divergence between poor and rich people , poor and rich regions and poor and rich hemispheres of this world , it would be completely unacceptable and very dangerous . #% There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well . #% In fact , the whole question of why some people choose to deal with life through the haze of drugs , why some people become addicted and others do not , is also part of the issue we have to face . #% I have no doubt that the Irish presidency is only too well aware that its draft document is embarrassingly weak on the vexed question of the veto and qualified majority voting . #% 
So I would ask you , Mr President , to request that the Commission carry out an investigation into this matter and report back to this House . #% We know that new forms of business , particularly in the field of e-commerce , are developing . #% Just as we were delighted to remove Berlin walls in Europe , we do not want to see similar walls erected in Jerusalem . #% The Stern report is quite explicit on the economic savings that can be made with regard to energy efficiency . #% This seems to say that when you enter another European country a cure of some description happens and if I was to live in another part of Europe I would have to go through the same process again . #% We need enforcement and no one has a problem with that -- consumers or farmers , it is in all our interests . #% You would eliminate another quarter if your farming and your forestry practices took carbon out of the air and put it back in the soil and the plants , where it should be . #% The export of small arms in particular to third countries which do not uphold values of democracy and human rights creates greater instability , not just in the regions to which the arms are exported , but for the world as a whole . #% The time is clearly right to bring forward these directives , stability requirements and technical updates for these ships . #% If the agreement is implemented , the EU will be violating international law and helping to prolong a conflict which has already lasted for 30 years . #% Now we have the chief observer on behalf of the European Union being somewhat rubbished by a statement from the Council , which was excellent in its artful dodging and with no reference to the serious flaws in the electoral process , just a bland reference to the reports of manipulation . #% That is why , President-in-Office , the ideas being proposed on improving justice and home affairs , promoting alternative energy -- although I might disagree with you on other aspects of climate change and their solutions -- and new ways of creating biofuels , bio-energy and bioethanol are the way forward . #% Social partnership has proven itself as a model with regard to how we can overcome difficulties in the workplace , ensuring proper representation for workers and also guaranteeing that enterprises have the freedom and flexibility to move forward . #% The key elements of this Agency are its research and distribution of best practice to Member States in relation to standards concerning health and safety at work . #% Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative . #% We must ensure that the equipment or networks required by multiple users to allow innovation are not withheld from the market . #% It would be very unfortunate if infighting in Brussels or excessive bureaucracy were to result in a delay . #% It is therefore offensive and utterly wrong that women in economic need in poor countries are being offered financial incentives to become paid donors . #% Mr President , let me say that I am shocked and horrified at the Commission reply on the issue of Iraq and the dismissive way in which they dealt with it . #% Related to this motion , I believe the EU needs to show some initiative in encouraging the international community to plan for and prepare for natural disasters in the future . #% You talk about respecting all conditions of animal welfare and say you need a well-balanced solution . #% The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue . #% This view was made plain in Council working groups and was reflected in the final draft Presidency Proposal , a draft that is supported by the vast majority of Member States . #% I am pleased that this point has been taken on board and that it has been recognised that building interconnectors is a valid way of opening up the energy market . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work . #% In the future , they will also alter the way in which we get our entertainment - whether through music , plays , television programmes , films or books . #% I am puzzled by the Council 's excessive caution . #% Major green investment is needed in areas like renewable infrastructure , with more wind farms in the north and solar energy in the south . #% More importantly , the implementation of an effective traceability programme from producer to consumer is crucial to the overall success of our campaign to restore consumer confidence . #% In the UK , members of the so-called `` Wonderland Club '' , an Internet paedophilia ring , were arrested and found to have sites in 12 different European countries . #% With a transitional period we would ensure that the inequalities will be continued and that Members who are reelected to this House , who presently earn two times or two and a half times what I earn at the moment will continue that inequality . #% This package of proposals amounts to the most wide-ranging and fundamental examination of all the major political issues dealt with at European Union level : budget and financing , common policies , the process of enlargement , as well as the prospect of economic and social cohesion . #% However , we are back to where we are because of the statement from the Commission today and also because of the underhand moves taking place in certain capitals around Europe to try to prevent or slow down the accession of Bulgaria and Romania . #% Where are EFSA 's studies ? #% The tragic events that took place in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence . #% However , in the case of Sweden , they have nudged the Community more towards the whole question of openness and transparency and have been among the leading Member States in putting this item on the agenda . #% As far as Galileo is concerned , Mr President , you know more than anyone else in this House what is needed . #% Parliament immediately reacted with a counterproposal , but this was not reflected in the Council 's position . #% The Finnish Government is certainly laying a great emphasis on the need to promote the enlargement process to a greater extent . #% Finally , since we would like to have a sort of regionalisation , a 30-mile limit would be immensely helpful to employ the goodwill of fishermen in the business of reorganising . #% In these circumstances , full implementation of the Rail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about . #% This must be recognised at Vienna as , indeed , must the renewed interest in Malta . #% But the high-rise flat occupants of the Greens know very little about the reality of farming today and have learned very little . #% Precarious work forms prey on the weakest sections of our societies , denying people dignity in work and the chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families . #% If this is to be maintained , it is important that degressivity is not introduced after 2006 . #% If there is a depletion of stocks it is not Irish fishermen but some greedy neighbours in other Member States who are responsible for it . #% I want to ask him whether he believes that by-products of the European forestry industry have a potentially important role to play in the future in providing renewable energy sources . #% There is an urgent need for immediate action . #% In that context , I agree fully with the rapporteur that funding for rural development should not involve robbing the first pillar to pay for the second pillar . #% He highlights the fact that 15 % of the legislation adopted on the single market has not , as yet , been transposed in all the Member States . #% I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report . #% We welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things , such as waste reduction plans . #% My group deplores the fact that this code of secrecy was slipped in during the Parliamentary summer recess , with no Parliamentary consultation and by written procedure . #% For example , there is the pigmeat industry where we produce 18 million tons of pigmeat annually and we end up in a situation where there is a million tons in surplus . #% It is clear that an international force must be interposed between them , because there is literally no other way of keeping them apart . #% The highest priority for you now is to begin to give operational content and meaning to both the non-military and military challenges of Petersberg , not least , given the several hats you wear , particularly the military ones . #% The recently introduced legislation , in particular the anti-terrorist statute which was adopted in December , gives judicial powers to the armed forces . #% There are huge sums of money going astray which we could use very effectively in the European Union . #% The setting of a common base is intrinsically linked to a harmonised rate . #% The intimidation , arbitrary arrests and disappearances - which is probably another way of saying summary executions - of opponents , particularly in recent months , is quite unacceptable . #% On the average farm income in the EU in 2003 , we ranked eighth . #% The purpose of this draft framework decision is to ensure that the results of laboratory activities in one Member State are recognised as being equivalent to the results of laboratory activities in other Member States , thereby guaranteeing legal certainty to the suspects and improved judicial cooperation where evidence of one Member State is used in proceedings in another Member State . #% Finally , small programmes and small initiatives can be very useful . #% in writing . - I support this regulation which will allow faster and more efficient access to European funds in order to prevent unemployment and fight social exclusion during the crisis . #% Which of us knows today what will be the crisis sectors of the future ? #% Before making my contribution , I would like to stress that I am not speaking on behalf of the IND/DEM Group as it has no position on this topic . #% 
The conclusions of the recent Brussels European Council clearly rule out any negotiation on the Berlin Agreement and Agenda 2000 . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Jöns for her report which draws attention to the nature of the work contract between employees in part-time work and their employers and the many ways in which discrimination against these workers occurs . #% There is also the question of Internet pornography . #% What is wrong ? #% They must resist the temptation often to gold-plate or add on national requirements . #% That suggests : ` Domestic violence against women is the main cause of death and invalidity among women between the ages of 16 and 44 . ' #% The European Union 's stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort . #% I certainly believe we can improve the situation , I believe this can be achieved , and I believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable . #% The only people who could be happy with these disgraceful delays are those involved in the illegal drugs trade . #% Enlargement of the Union to include countries from Central and Eastern Europe is absolutely unthinkable unless we have this kind of control over organized crime . #% As you can see , even in the electoral process in Member States positive discrimination is the only way to get women elected to national parliaments and to the European Parliament . #% I know that if I speak to my constituents , they will give little support to the current spending on Galileo , let alone an increase . #% Mr President , as I have already informed you , I would like to speak on a procedural matter , namely , why we should add another section to this report . #% The issue at stake is one of principle and is crucial to the future nature of interinstitutional relations in the area of external action . #% Question 9 by my colleague , Mrs McGuinness , is very close to my own , question 11 , and again , we are not going to get to another question . #% However , as I said , these compromise amendments are a very good step in the right direction and a clear signal that we are serious about protecting Europe 's coastal zones . #% This is an initiative of Sweden and Spain on ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body in order to combat crime through closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the Member States . #% For instance , in Ireland 98 % of what is manufactured is transported by road . #% Mr President , could I ask the President-in-Office once again to restate so everybody can hear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a non-binding political declaration as approved by the Heads of State and Heads of Government in Nice . #% As well as the concerns that have already been expressed , I should like to draw the Commission 's attention to paragraph 15 of my colleague 's report which calls on the Council and Commission to encourage the closure of unsafe nuclear power stations in Europe . #% I would genuinely like to know what would be the effect on the public procurement market if thresholds were to be increased , and particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises and on consumers . #% When imports of beef into the EU are added to domestic production , the total is almost one million tonnes higher than the internal market uptake . #% If Objective 1 status was accorded to the midland region , it would develop as a region on the back of the infrastructural improvements such as the Portlaoise bypass , so as to attract more investment and create more jobs . #% Any help is welcome but the current package will have to be substantially increased if it is to address the real losses to the people involved . #% I thank him very sincerely for what I consider to be one of the finest statements I have heard in Parliament from a President-in-Office for a considerable period of time . #% Providing expertise is one thing , taking advice is another . #% Mr President , rarely do we hear a subject discussed in this Chamber which brings so many groups together in enthusiasm . #% When the Gargani amendments failed to pass , I voted in favour of Amendments 319 and 358 by Niebler et al as a damage-control exercise . #% We simply want evidence that a partnership pact is going to be an operation with local authorities , with NGOs and , indeed , with the social partners . #% The real difficulties will arise within the framework of the final status negotiations , which includes the contentious issue of Jerusalem , control over water rights and the return of refugees . #% We need to return again to people and their value as the central issue . #% A united front , spearheaded by the Union and the United States , will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers . #% I refer to these as ` home carers ' , and will continue to do so for the rest of my time here . #% Mr President , first of all I should like say on behalf of my group that we are very disappointed at the failure to include in the resolution a call for all European Member States and EU applicant Member States to give their full support for the new agenda coalition resolution which is now on the table of the 55th United Nations General Assembly . #% These people would be at the height of their sports careers if they were not ill or had they not died . #% This can be taken as an indication of the ongoing concern of the Union about the matters which the Member has raised . #% You took over at a very difficult period when relations had been fractured between the two key institutions of the Union , the Commission and the Parliament . #% The reactivation of the Ferries Directive , whereby ferry workers would have the same working conditions irrespective of their nationality , would be a step in the right direction . #% Firstly , the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment . #% Instead , let us have the same kind of investment in renewable energy that we have seen in nuclear energy over the past 40 years . #% That is a welcome move . #% Allowing the sale of objects containing dangerous substances which children will put in their mouths goes completely against the precautionary approach . #% That is a responsibility for the Council . #% They do not want to see broad economic guidelines debated here once a year , having no effects to them on the ground . #% I accept that a balance between fish resources and fleet numbers needs to be gained , but I do not accept that this should be at the expense of small fishing fleets , which account for over 80 % of the European fleet . #% In the agricultural industry , as in any other , farmers and livestock dealers have very large vested interests in presenting their product in prime condition in order to command the best possible price . #% Such democratic deficit is one of the design defects of this EU . #% I want to ask him : Does the Council intend to approve this Association Agreement if the appalling human rights abuses continue in Algeria ? #% Products which have been widely and safely used for many years in several EU Member States are being restricted without any health and safety justifications . #% The fact that Hizbollah , supplied by Iran and Syria , was able to act as it did while part of the Government of Lebanon illustrates the folly of ever admitting to government any terrorist-orientated organisation , be it in Lebanon , Palestine or , indeed , in my own Northern Ireland . #% It is estimated by the Irish Exporters Association that a truck travelling from Ireland to mainland Europe via Holyhead and Dover will incur a road use charge of EUR 120 and an external cost of EUR 30 . #% It appears to me that the Dalai Lama , and indeed His Excellency the Chinese Ambassador , are singing from the same hymn sheet on this and I would urge them to make progress . #% We have to ask why they do it , and whether they are doing it to make a lot of extra money , as Mr Häusling says . #% In the context of the proposed revision or review of the early farm retirement scheme , I put it to the President-in-Office that perhaps he should consider making it possible for retiring farmers not to have to opt out totally , but to remain in partial employment , because even from a psychological point of view that is extremely important . #% This issue has raised concerns in most of the Member States . #% Vocational education and training should be accessible , available and affordable at all times of life , regardless of the people 's status on the labour market or of their income . #% The environmental benefit of their management , their energy and their skills is also being lost . #% International global security is best dealt with multilaterally under the auspices of the UN , not unilaterally , and I welcome the objective for Prime Minister Simitis to secure a common European Union position on Iraq when the UN inspectors ' report is published . #% It seems extraordinary that this Parliament , which represents the people of Europe , is not addressing this question this week , given the deepening of the crisis since the Commission last spoke . #% You can not allow what is going to happen to the Irish Box to go ahead . #% This is a painful process and involves significant economic restructuring . #% For economic growth , independence and freedom of action are essential with more , not less , national flexibility . #% I do not refer simply to food aid . #% So this argument is not important all . #% No-one has agreed to an oral amendment of any sort . #% That apart , the legacy on the constitutional front which this presidency bequeaths to us is not , in my opinion , welcome or happy . #% 
A further safeguard is that commercial scale is defined as acts resulting in commercial and financial gain . #% We did have a statement by the Commission for 2000-2006 and that set out certain perimeters within which agricultural spending would be provided for . #% The resolution , which seeks to influence the Commission 's upcoming strategy for Roma inclusion , also calls for better protection of fundamental rights and use of EU funding . #% After attempts on their lives , the doctors escaped to Ireland last September . #% Would the harmonisation of the base not lead to a harmonisation of the rate ? #% She will play a critical role in Europe 's recovery and I wish her well with this . #% That is what the European Community is committed to funding and it is not unreasonable to expect a satisfactory response . #% Ten times that number attempt suicide . #% This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy . #% Even the new CEO , Mr Norman Askew , is reported as saying that reprocessing is not the big part of the business it once was . #% Treating agriculture and food as ordinary products on a production line threatens our very food security . #% The respective roles of the Council and the Commission , like all the institutions , are being examined by the Intergovernmental Conference . #% It takes two sides to make a debate . #% If we sit back and allow Member States to stall on the current directive , by not putting pressure on them through a new directive , we would be making a grave mistake . #% This study should also address the need to strengthen competition policy instruments to prevent predatory pricing and its unwanted side effects . #% In our joint motion for a resolution we have called for a wider examination of the root causes of the conflict . #% It did not give us the trade union rights that we so badly need . #% This also takes into consideration the fact that within the workings of an internal market there are still many social problems which exist in both urban and rural parts of Europe and certainly in my own country , Ireland . #% The MAGPs , which we will come back to later today , have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction . #% As far as Cyprus is concerned , I am glad that Cyprus has made considerable progress and that it has been recommended to us . #% I was looking at some figures a few days ago . #% I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that , and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament , we too seized the moment . #% Commissioner , it only takes one accident over a densely-populated area like Belgium and Luxembourg to have lethal results when radioactive material is transported - I should not have to remind you of that . #% Clever people all over Europe are waiting to hear what we decide this week , because next year they will be able to use their brains on our behalf . #% Mr President , I welcome this report . #% I was against it because it provided for unplanned and unscheduled increases in farmers ' incomes which they were not looking for and did not expect . #% If we had a European Prosecutor dealing with our own resources - we do not want to take it any further than that - I think the focus of the authorities in the Member States who actually spend this money would be sharpened . #% My constituent goes on to say that it is not just a cross-border issue , but a European one . #% We must be very vigilant that we do not encourage large firms to move their research and development and innovation activities outside the EU . #% We must now reflect on that decision , each and every one of us in this House and throughout the European Union . #% This is one of the insufferable burdens of EU membership and a salutary warning against the increasing Brussels ' control which the new Constitution would bring upon us , given the socio-economic dogma which it contains in Part III . #% Madam President , my Group welcomes some of the changes that have been made in this report insofar as a distinction is now being made between money for fishing rights and money for development . #% Yes , gender equality is one of the major values the EU stands for and it would be very helpful , in selling the new Constitutional Treaty , if we stressed that it is reinforced in the Treaty . #% The European Union can have a role tin providing some of this leadership , including through rethinking its approach on aid to Palestine and its relations with Hamas . #% And this via media which we sought to bring forward - and as democrats we have to accept the win or loss - was blown out of the water by a procedure which disgusts me . #% I have no doubt that some of the very large industries will be able to cope with this and take it in their stride , but the small entrepreneurs trying to develop small industries and get them off the ground are probably going to be hit very hard . #% Those views were reinforced by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy last week : we are in favour of the development of therapies for dreadful diseases by the use of embryonic stem cells under very strict conditions , with no creation of embryos for research , with the use of supernumerary embryos , with the consent of parents and without payment . #% I believe a Member State has the right to reject such partnerships as not equal to heterosexual relationships . #% For this reason , contamination of the environment is possible during the production phase , and during the waste phase once PVC has been used . #% The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise . #% Concern over this was also expressed from northern circles because the Bureau is active with regard to the language aspects of the Good Friday agreement . #% Developed countries must take the first meaningful steps in reducing emissions . #% Trusting Member States is fine , but trust has always to be earned and if there are concerns , I believe they need to be dealt with . #% Servicing debt costs the poorest countries more than they receive in development aid . #% It is important to point out that , as a cross-border activity , trafficking knows no borders . #% I think it is timely and I return to my point - I still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the Member States and that we in Europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected . #% Morocco is the first , but there are more to come . #% I am very surprised that she was working in an insurance company 30 years ago : I did not think she was that old , so she wears her age well . #% What happens if that person is unfortunate enough to die unexpectedly ? #% We already vaccinate our cattle for a whole array of diseases and consume them daily . #% What are we going to do in Europe ? #% Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten , to some extent echoed today , we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action . #% Yes , smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers . #% It gives us that legal base for a set period although I have the same reservations as Mr Linkohr about the lack of a uniform legal base . #% I have in my hand a resolution which is going before the House of Commons today on the issue of Bloody Sunday . #% It is the one thing I do not miss having to do in this House now that we have some degree of normality in Northern Ireland . #% While it is not a time for apportioning blame for what has happened , I believe farmers were by and large innocent victims of sections of an unscrupulous animal-feed sector , some of which resorted to the use of sewage sludge as an ingredient in animal feed , while others continued to use illegal meat and bone meal . #% So far it has shown itself to be more interested in political posturing and media manipulation than in getting justice for the McCartney family . #% Mr President , I returned recently , with some colleagues from the Group of the Party of European Socialists , from a trip to China , including Tibet . #% The discussion is now taking place . #% The key to this debate is balance . #% We have to stop dangling artificial carrots in front of the applicant states and be honest . #% We ask for fair play in return for that support . #% There are those in this House , and indeed within the administration , who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe . #% Unfortunately , however , like all of us here in Parliament , the rapporteur seems to be working at somewhat of a disadvantage , because we do not have access yet to the Council and the Commission 's evaluation mechanism concerning the operation of the European Arrest Warrant . #% Whatever one 's views about the future of nuclear power , mine are considerably less optimistic than those of others who have spoken . #% 
We do not need to be first among equals , but we assert the right to be treated as an equal among equals . #% It is proper that these anxieties are listened to , respected and addressed . #% In relation to fraud in export refunds -- an issue that came up during last night 's sitting and in the media recently -- one of the ways to avoid that would be to get rid of export refunds . #% Although I agree with the demand that the Palestinian Authority make every effort to prevent terrorist acts , the question has to be asked how can they act when their political , security and civil infrastructures are being destroyed in an incessant military campaign which has claimed many innocent lives ? #% There is clearly a need for more thorough checking of containers at the point of departure and arrival and for closer cooperation between the authorities in different countries . #% It concerns human rights and the fight against terrorism , which in many ways seems like a contradiction in terms . #% This is therefore an ideal means of supplementing the demand . #% As we approach the world trade talks again in November , I urge the Commission to ensure that beef is treated as a sensitive product and that we do not eradicate our own beef producers because of cheap third country imports . #% Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed . #% We must begin to rebuild that relationship . #% The Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative achieved moderate success in tackling debt relief for the 42 poorest countries in the world , but this was only an initial effort by the developed world to tackle the problem of debt relief itself . #% Just let me quote to the Commissioner , and to the Commission , the saying of Oscar Wilde that in our dealings with life , destiny never closes her book . #% Batch numbers of this feed must be carefully recorded from manufacturer through to final farm delivery and use in order to ensure maximum traceability . #% Additionally , there are regions within Ireland , including the midland region , that still fall well below the EU average in terms of employment and economic growth . #% Before World War II , a famous American general made this comment about possible atomic weapons : ` Atomic weapons are to an army what an elephant is to a mouse . #% I know there is a multiplicity of these papers and it sounds very good that this should be addressed in some way by the JPA or the ACP member states . #% I wish to raise the question with the President-in-Office of the change in American policy since we in the European Union changed the whole direction of the support we give to agriculture following the last round of GATT negotiations . #% The special programme for peace and reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland have done outstanding work in giving great hope to our young people . #% We have enjoyed working with her over the last five years in the environmental portfolio . #% Yet I am sure you will agree with me that it is scandalous and shocking that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the UK and the spokesperson for small businesses , Angela Knight MP , an MP in my own Euro-constituency , said that the Treasury 's late payment on 25 % of its bills is not exactly the crime it has been portrayed as . #% For every measure we take here , we are supposed to have an employment audit . #% There has been peaceful progress on the Lebanese-Israeli border since the Lebanese Government gained authority within the region , and we all must certainly welcome the fact that southern Lebanon is now at peace . #% However , we must not make the same mistakes that surrounded the introduction of decimalisation in Ireland in 1972 . #% In recent months there have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and twelve aid workers have been killed in Darfur in the last six months . #% I would like to raise the question of whether we in the European Union would be prepared to share the vaccines we already have in our possession with regions where an outbreak occurs , in an effort to contain it . #% The truth is that they are being intimidated and are afraid to come forward : such is the hold of the provisional IRA on the people in this area . #% It is critical to secure the viability of the emissions trading market in the short term if it is to survive in the longer term . #% That having been said , I accept that not only do we need the legal underpinning that your excellent report gives us but we also need considerably more training for the judges in all our countries . #% There are a lot of circles to be squared here , less revisionism about what conditions were like in our industries years ago , and we need an honest , open dialogue . #% in writing . - I support this resolution , which calls on the Lithuanian Parliament to reject draft legislation that seeks to punish the ` public promotion of homosexual relations ' with fines . #% However , I would like to point out that this applies as much to the Member States of the European Union as it does to countries that share our borders . #% We want real solutions for real issues . #% The tragedy of Burundi continues with total disregard for human rights , summary executions and the massacre of thousands of people over a long period of time . #% Mr President , the Committee on Industry agreed to vote on this item only on condition that the Commission would come to the Chamber and give an explanation as to the procedure , and would give us certain assurances . #% I have nothing against the Scottish Police . #% The people want sensible cooperation and not dogmatic federalism . #% A second general point I should like to refer to is in respect of the efficiency of policy . #% Farmers already in the EU are facing terrifying difficulties . #% Then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the EU for the cooling of homes . #% One of the ways to ensure that women are liberated , have rights and know their rights , is through a proper education system . #% The Republic of Ireland 's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland , but the first time there is a bit of trouble , it runs away ! #% Much of the resolution is devoted , as other speakers have said , to Mr Wang Dan 's case . #% Apart from the clear health risks involved in transplanting cloned material when so much is unknown about the future consequences , I oppose the creation of human life as raw material for tissues and cells . #% We must break down legal barriers to harmonize those concepts of criminal legislation in the Member States which reduce our capacity to protect our children . #% There is also the deepest concern with a Charter of Fundamental Rights , clearly intended to be legally binding in 2004 , as a constitution or constitution-treaty , which through the decisions of the EU Court of Justice could take precedence over our Irish Constitution and our Courts . #% Even if we ask the county councils or national governments to collect it and pass it on to us , that does not prevent it from being own-resources . #% This is especially true in the context of the nothing-is-agreed-until-everything-is-agreed formula with a deadline set for next March . #% Finally , we can give leadership , as we already have done , and the best way to do so is by example , not merely by criticising people who do not agree with us . #% It is not a position that you will hear too often from an Irish Member in this House and , for that reason , I wanted to put it on the record . #% I do not begrudge the fishermen of Spain and France the subsidies we are giving them but I think we should give them in a different way . #% But with over four million abortions a year in Europe , we can not really say that our falling birth rate is primarily about infertility . #% The solution lies in EU level cooperation , namely in the form of some tough legislation . #% I particularly welcome the demands that nuclear decommissioning funds be fully subject to EU competition law . #% Now is the time to chart the new way forward and to dust down the roadmap , invigorate it and make it new for the 21st century . #% They show that the average fine in the United Kingdom was almost EUR 78 000 whereas the EU average was a mere EUR 4 500 . #% We should decide in conciliation and not let the ECJ decide , even though I would be very optimistic that my personal opinion will come out of the ECJ . #% Mr President , Ireland has the European Parliament to thank for ensuring extra funding for neighbourhoods in crisis . #% It is yet another undermining of the services to which Members are entitled . #% I am asking the Commissioner , given that the UK now has the highest poverty rate in the EU - one in three babies is born into families in poverty - to look at the model of job creation and sustainable high-value , highproductivity jobs to give EU regions a competitive edge in Europe . #% The point is , diplomacy is failing . #% They will contribute to achieving the Lisbon objective , namely of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 . #% It is a relatively small amount of money when you consider it as regional aid to fishing ports in any part of the Community . #% Anybody who has been to Dublin recently will know of the seriousness of our traffic congestion problems . #% We need a financing instrument which is exclusively targeted at the objectives of poverty eradication as defined in the Lisbon Treaty and which only covers developing countries . #% Unfortunately , they have not had an opportunity to contribute to the resolution before the House today . #% I just want to ask Commissioner Verheugen whether he could reaffirm what I believe he said through the interpretation : that it is absolutely necessary for enlargement to be completed under this process , that the Treaty of Nice will have to be ratified by Ireland . #% 
I welcome in particular the decision hold a seminar on the fringes involving the tourism stakeholders . #% Indeed , the Commissioner , in a response to the debate , said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes . #% Trying to find agreement and , if necessary , compromise on all of those considerations was never going to be easy . #% Not content with having precipitated the crisis , these parasites now want to exploit it to rake in further billions . #% Such measures , Mr Trichet , will assist in creating economic stability , environmental sustainability and consumer confidence . #% If we fail to act quickly we can anticipate humanitarian disaster in the Balkans next winter . #% The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall , mostly on Palestinian territory , is ghettoising Palestinians , destroying their livelihoods , imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair . #% The Commission considered that for costly , long-lasting , complex products , such as motor vehicles , protection of the design relating to individual parts could exclude or limit competition , creating a captive market in spare parts in the absence of an appropriate derogation . #% So , as a member of the Consumer Protection Committee , I have at all times , along with Mrs Kuhn and Mr Whitehead , supported measures that will ensure that the needs and concerns of consumers are given real and appropriate protection by means of European legislation . #% A lot of these new technologies are too expensive for ordinary users to get access to . #% I do not support the legalisation of ecstasy , cannabis or other synthetic drugs such as LSD or amphetamines . #% For some of them it has been , and continues to be , difficult . #% The issues are not linked , but we need to put our priorities right . #% Likewise , this proposal that the Conference of Presidents acting by three-fifths majority , representing at least three groups , may propose to the plenary - acting by absolute majority - to terminate any elected office holder 's position within this Parliament . #% It is important that these negotiations are undertaken in a calm and rational manner . #% The Union must orientate its activities to initiatives such as this if it is to respond to the needs and issues of concern to its citizens . #% However , there have been problems with the implementation of this in certain Member States and thus the Commission 's current approach is welcome . #% I am pleased to note that the scientific , technical and economic committee have supported the proposal , having examined the report of the advisory committee of fisheries management during its November 1999 session , in addition to the specific provisions on the use of Danish seine nets in the plaice box . #% Madam President , I was told quite explicitly that I had to be present to indicate that I wanted to make a written explanation of vote . #% Also , it is very necessary for MEPs - and not only MEPs , but the public at large - to be able to find out more about what is going on there . #% China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate is higher for women than for men . #% I have no special quarrel with the Spanish , French or British fishermen who come into what are natural waters . #% According to the respected NGO War on Want , that would threaten a further 7.5 million workers with losing their jobs , including in the poorest countries . #% The Dioxin and BSE debates failed to get across the strong message that the quality of European food is the best in the world , and consumers get both quality and value for money . #% That can not happen if we do not know the statistics of the agricultural industry . #% I thank the Presidency for that reply . #% What role does the Commission see for itself in this area , or is it going to be the Member States ' responsibility ? #% If this is to happen then it must be accompanied by a commitment to increase the resources available to secure the external borders against the activities of the drug smugglers . #% There are always consequences when we go against nature . #% In the interests of equity , productivity and social stability , we must address the serious issue of Europe 's greying population and so we must create the optimum conditions for jobs . #% They too deserve serious consideration in the ongoing reforms . #% Our next step must be to convince young people , especially young women , not to go down this road . #% This is a well-focused report with concrete suggestions . #% The negative micro-management spiral has to be avoided and the common fisheries policy needs to be fundamentally altered , as the discard issue seriously discredits it . #% What will happen in relation to the education system in Iraq and how will it be reinstated ? #% All in all , my group will support the Barzanti report but we urge that our amendments be adopted . #% The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing , positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy ; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about . #% In Ireland , the only country in the European Union which will vote on the Treaty of Nice , I am informed by my constituents that the Irish Government is not providing copies of the Treaty of Nice , but only its White Paper on the Treaty . #% I believe that the safeguards are in place to guarantee that these feedstuffs will all have been tried and tested before they enter the food chain . #% Unfortunately , over the last 48 hours , President Chandrika Kumaratunga , who belongs to the opposition party , has sacked four key ministers , suspended the Parliament and declared a state of emergency . #% Therefore I join with other colleagues in appealing to all Member States not only to comply with their own constitutional obligations , but actually to put this forward to a referendum of the people within the Member States to give it the kind of endorsement and approval that it requires . #% Parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the Treaty . #% In relation to historical waste , that is particularly important in countries like my own where mining activities are not as prolific as they have been in the past . #% Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement : they are manmade . #% I welcome the forthcoming communication on enterprise , but I hope that past work will also be looked at before we go ahead with more . #% But our clear legal advice is that this will not withstand a challenge before the European Court . #% It is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive . #% Would the President-in-Office not agree that the situation for women in Afghanistan has not changed at all outside of Kabul ? #% Of course , in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and , unlike national budgets , it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union . #% No one country can tackle this alone . #% As a result , a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania , a geographical area close to where they operated previously . #% I also support the proposed directive to improve the quality of petrol and diesel fuels in Europe . #% We do not need to create even more paperwork and administrative hassle for already beleaguered farmers . #% This presents us with a great opportunity to send out a very strong message to those people who are putting their own capital at risk that we are willing to act with them as joint partners in creating new enterprises , new jobs and , in particular , new economic wealth . #% Secondly , such a programme would be extraordinarily difficult to monitor or control . #% One of the goals of the international year is to create the right conditions for more sports-based development programmes and projects . #% Members of this Parliament hail from 15 different sovereign states and are aware that company law differs widely from one Member State to another . #% I am extremely surprised by the Commissioner 's response and I can only characterize it as gobbledygook . #% This is an extremely important report because the European Union has to look at its own faults and problems before it can actually point the finger at other parts of the world . #% They were told how the common agricultural policy was going to operate for a seven year period until 2006 and they were basing their commercial decisions on this framework as laid down in the Berlin Agreement . #% They will have to fend for themselves , because governments will not have the money , after privatising their nations ' resources , to satisfy large corporate interests . #% I am happy that Commissioner Špidla is in the Chamber at the moment and I hope he has taken note of my remarks because they are serious : they are not made lightly . #% I believe that there is a role for the Commission in dealing with this sensitive issue and that this energy matter is best coordinated at European Union level in the interests of European industry and the citizens of the European Union . #% It is my hope that the EUR 6.199 million will help produce a successful way out of the crisis for the workers , their families and the area #% Mr President , I welcome this regulation . #% To take an example , in 1992 we as a Union drew up the Petersberg Tasks which offered comprehensive non-military and military security options . #% 
I also welcome the decisions to place all relevant scientific committees under the authority of DG XXIV and to establish a new unit on the assessment of public health risks and the inspection of foodstuffs also under DG XXIV . #% No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right . #% The debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process . #% The books must be opened up so that the workers and those affected by them can see for the first time where the money has gone and workers ' control must be exercised on the operation of these agencies so that their massive resources are used for the benefit of working people , small farmers and the environment . #% The Council have used creative accounting to find EUR 420 million . #% As to the argument whether you slaughter the whole of the herd , there is no scientific evidence to say you should . #% Nevertheless , this is a tangible reality for citizens of Europe . #% It would have been helpful if we had known your mind before we started , Commissioner , because we are speaking in a vacuum . #% Therefore I would hope that we maintain our emphasis on life-long learning . #% That is what the debate must be about . #% Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 commits coastal signatories to integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas . #% The draft Treaty presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki forms the basis for discussions on a final agreed text at European Union level . #% We can not change the rules and we can not deny it to them . #% The organisation of health care systems , their funding and planning are , of course , matters for the Member States . #% However , at European level serious questions continue to be raised by many of our citizens concerning democracy and the European institutions . #% Finally , I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs . #% Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey . #% We have a specific problem of demographics , geography and lack of infrastructure , and no indigenous packaging industry , with 80 % of our packaged goods being imported . #% But we have yet to establish an infrastructure to enable the Brussels Convention , as amended and extended , to benefit our EU consumer citizens and to attract inward investment . #% We will have no directive on mergers and takeovers and we will have no information and consultation with rights for workers , even though mergers and takeovers will continue to happen across the European Union . #% It is clear that the WTO talks can not succeed as long as it insists on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihood of our small and medium farmers , because they are the ones at risk , not the agricultural exports , Commissioner . #% If it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross-border provisions , how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market ? #% It is obvious from the opening speeches in this morning 's debate that the election campaign is already under way . #% Some of the trucks from my country have been held up into the second week . #% In Ireland the level of alcohol abuse by young people has grown dramatically over the years . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of the House a report this week that three of the world 's largest oil companies no longer directly own petrol filling stations in Northern Ireland . #% Not allowing Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation -- how sad is that ? #% This example has already been proven in certain areas by voluntary agreements in Irish waters and by maintenance of these non-fishing areas - so-called set-aside areas , to give the analogy with the common agricultural policy - for a certain period of time . #% The European Union recognizes the need for further improvements and progress in the whole area of implementation of human rights and democratic freedoms in Turkey . #% Ryanair , whose owners and senior managers had been very substantial financial beneficiaries of air transport liberalization , must immediately enter into dialogue with these employees who seek to be represented by a trade union of their choice and to utilize the resources of the national procedures that exist . #% We already have a truly great Constitution , for which Irish men and women laid down their lives , a Constitution which gives us a genuine foundation for real and respectful cooperation with our European neighbours . #% I would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers . #% The market for more than half of our autumn beef exports has been lost and the collapse of pig prices in Ireland is partly due to the fall in demand from Russia . #% The database and information technology exists to establish the necessary communications between national and regional authorities , emergency response experts and the public . #% As a representative of the border region of Ireland I want to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur , Parliament , the various groups and the Commission for the consideration and sympathy that they have always shown with the problems in Northern Ireland . #% There is going to be an Atlantic dream financed partly by EU aid while the fishermen in Northern Ireland are being pushed to destroy their own boats . #% The role of farmers as guarantors of sustainable and quality food supply must be brought more into focus , because we ignore at our peril the fact that agriculture is a commercial activity . #% Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments ? #% This is an important area where we can bring all the actors together , including the manufacturers of equipment who can put in place certain things that can help us . #% It is also essential that we look at new models and new ways of training , and that we create this synergy between the employers , the trade unions and the unemployed themselves to develop the best models for coping for them . #% I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement . #% There is currently a need for simplification to be brought into any new arrangement , with the minimum of red tape . #% It is , however , important that the Commission addresses some of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and of my political group on the issue of sales below cost in particular . #% Ms Bellamy , who directed UNICEF after Mr Grant , was forced to resign last year . #% This period has afforded us sufficient opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the directive in contributing to a genuine single market for motor insurance . #% I was therefore particularly pleased to be there on the historic occasion of the signing of the ceasefire agreement , which hopefully will herald a new dawn of peace and prosperity underpinned by the strengthening of human rights . #% This round of trade talks must truly be a development round . #% I think , with regard to the appeal , it would be a magnificent gesture if the Chinese Government , in an effort to try to repair the damage done to date , were to permit observers to attend this appeal . #% Any waste coming from continental Europe will most likely be shipped through the Irish Sea , putting us at additional risk . #% Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control ? #% Furthermore , the report refers to the fact that we should explore the possibility of using animal protein as a source of animal feed . #% It is not in anybody 's interest , particularly in Ireland , with our greater dependence on agricultural exports , that the basic infrastructure of the food sector - the family farm - is in such dire straits . #% That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or , to some extent , in the rest of Europe . #% Firstly , we in the UPE Group are calling for a specific five-year EU action programme to combat this disease , backed-up with adequate resources . #% Mr President , I also rise to oppose referral back to committee . #% First of all , the only way we are going to solve the whole question of drug addiction and the health problems it poses is by reducing demand totally . #% I also welcome our amendment , which adds nanosciences to nanotechnology . #% The results will be greater congestion and environmental degradation , more accidents and a loss of competitiveness of European industry , which must rely , for the management of its supply chains , on cost-efficient transportation . #% Therefore I would ask you , once again , to specifically either deny or admit that you made the statement and also to explain why you interfered in such a way ? #% From the wealth of letters and comments that I have received as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee , I know it is not possible to please all interested parties . #% My sincere thanks to the Commissioner for her reply . #% I regret that the overall impact of the crisis on consumers and farmers is not improving . #% One worrying aspect is the difficulty the Commission apparently has with the lead times for its proposals . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Presidency and the Commission for the reports they have presented to us here today . #% Will you be making proposals for it to be continued into the next programme so that they have another six years ? #% This point is explicitly recognized by the Committee of Inquiry . #% 
Madam President , it is becoming increasingly evident that one of the more significant innovations of the Maastricht Treaty was enshrining the right to submit a petition . #% It should also be emphasised that each of us has an obligation to contribute to the blood supply on a voluntary basis , as it is essential to maintain these services for all . #% Perhaps the tragedy of his death will intensify regional and international pressure on the FNL to sign up to the peace agreement following their long-overdue talks with the government , so that no more lives are needlessly lost and so that peace is finally restored to Burundi . #% There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union . #% This centre will be funded from the EU Budget and will come into existence next year . #% Mr President , I welcome both Commissioner Patten 's contribution to this debate and Kofi Annan 's decision to send a fact-finding team to ascertain exactly what happened during the Israeli bombardment of Jenin refugee camp . #% It is right for Parliament to have oversight and the Commission should not fear any involvement of Parliament in that vein . #% Whose interests come first ? #% Having visited Iran with a delegation from this Parliament I am keenly aware on the dire needs of the population there . #% I understand that was what the money was actually used for . #% Any kind of advertising which promotes something that is a danger to health must be unacceptable in a civilized society . #% So , in that context , the phrase ` pensions time bomb ' is certainly accurate . #% As a parliamentarian I have to accept that we use procedures sometimes as a way of either promoting or shielding ourselves from particular votes . #% I am convinced that the national regulatory authorities will significantly contribute to the development of the internal market and create fair competitive conditions . #% It could set a very bad precedent for the future for other Member States and for nominations to this body . #% The illegal bombing by the US and Britain , which is not covered by any UN Security Council resolution , has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous : it should not be allowed to continue . #% As a result of the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the adoption of many amendments , the balance of Mrs de Esteban Martin 's report has been overturned . #% I know that Commissioner Bolkestein is sensitive to this issue . #% They include insecticides such as DDT -- perhaps the best-known POP -- industrial chemicals such as PCBs and indeed the unintentional by-products of industrial processes such as dioxins and furans . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , today we mark another step in the progress of Romania and Bulgaria towards welcoming them back into the family of democratic nations within the European Union . #% While we all condemn this , we have stood by and watched his henchmen murder innocent white farmers and be rewarded by the President for their actions . #% He was an unrepentant terrorist who introduced to the world the horror of the human suicide bomber . #% It is one thing to have poor output prices , but it is a double penalty when inputs are not available at world market prices . #% We have all been moved by the pictures and stories coming from the media in recent days . #% Fishermen in my region of Northern Ireland have faced closure in the Irish Sea for a long number of years and we have not seen any concrete evidence that this has been a success . #% Is that what the Commission is demanding or is the Irish government playing its own privatisation game under cover of the present crisis ? #% These leaders should remember that it is very hard to justify to European taxpayers the very substantial levels of financial assistance Kosovo is receiving from the Union if its leaders fail to condemn the violence which is taking place in the region at this time . #% The European Parliament is also concerned about reports of serious overcrowding and poor conditions in the refugee camps established by the Sri Lankan Government . #% Is that not the real meaning of the EU Commission 's document strategy paper on ` Global Europe : competing in the world ' , published only three years ago ? #% Irish and European passengers deserve to know that their basic civil liberties will not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism . #% I would ask you to urge the Commission to come forward as a matter of urgency with those proposals because they need to be brought forward before the end of this year . #% We respect in the act of voting tomorrow the essential collegiality of the European Commission and regard that as an essential value for its working method . #% Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel . #% Can we not do better ? #% Recently , the Commission put forward a package of proposals which , amongst other things , called for a reform of the CAP , the Structural Funds and the entire budgetary policy of the Union . #% Nothing I can say can adequately express the gratitude that the Irish people on both sides of the border feel for the investment that Europe has made for the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland , the border counties in the Irish Republic and the Northern Ireland Peace Process . #% If we try it again we create an illusion and that illusion will lead to a weak , inflation-prone , high interest rate Euro-zone . #% These decisions will affect us all and will affect everybody outside this Parliament : people will not have the right to privacy , and this is an issue that should be raised right across the board . #% I very much hope that this report will serve as a springboard for the much deeper discussion and analysis that we require . #% Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further . #% A lot of talking is going on , but there is very little action . #% Member States must be given the flexibility they require to implement the solutions they need to achieve their Lisbon objectives , hopefully by stimulating employment through a reduction in direct taxation , especially a reduction in labour taxes . #% Similarly , in the case of butter , only 75 % of the butter we produce is sold at market prices . #% If we are going to put in place comprehensive marketing campaigns to warn young people of the dangers of smoking , we need the necessary financial resources to oversee such a programme . #% This shows the concern in Northern Ireland to ensure action is taken on this issue as quickly as possible . #% I think that farmers particularly in the peripheral regions in Ireland , Northern Ireland and Scotland have to be grateful to the Commission , Parliament and the Council for the prompt attention which has been given to this problem and the resources which have been provided to meet the worst crisis those people have faced in a whole generation . #% There was the recent case of the Israeli Prime Minister being threatened with legal action . #% Life is not a commodity that can be bought and sold . #% The amendment to Article 16 reinforces the definition of organic agricultural products . #% Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury , arsenic , cadmium , antimony and many other toxic minerals , and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River , only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken . #% Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ? #% As you leave this House to go to the various capitals and form the Commission , we have a number of priorities we would like to see in respect of balance . #% What would you recommend as a result of all this assessment and forthcoming studies ? #% Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time , I shall concentrate on Palestine , because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine . #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteurs for their work and say that they have found a decent consensus and produced good reports . #% This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency . #% Decisions on taxation policy are best left to individual Member States . #% It is time we stopped allowing counterfeiters a free ride at the expense of consumers , legitimate businesses , EU jobs and the EU 's competitiveness . #% I voted against budget lines B7-6312 , Arndt 605 and Arndt 361 . #% I come from a Member State which benefits from European funding but I am appalled at its track record on the implementation of the wild birds directive , on the habitats directive and many other directives . #% The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 last month calling for the deployment of more than 22 000 peacekeepers in the region . #% One change I ask that we make is to take out Amendment 4 , which we will vote on separately tomorrow . #% If a ferry , for instance , is sailing from Ireland to France , at one stage during its journey it moves out of EU or national territorial waters into international waters . #% Mr President , urban development quite properly does not fall within the direct remit of the European Union , though in nation states it is substantially influenced by regional and other policies from Europe . #% We must find some fast-track codecision procedure which can be used in these circumstances and fully respects the role of the Members of this House . #% Finally , I wish to pay my compliments once again to Mrs Smet . #% 
Moreover , unleaded petrol and diesel sold after 1 January 2000 will also have to comply with the new environmental specifications . #% In the case of the Irrawaddy dolphin , I recognise that the proposal has some merit . #% It is regrettable that in different Member States , there are different levels of care for people with epilepsy . #% The voters and the media in the various Member States will be highlighting it . #% in writing . - Antibiotic resistance is a serious public health issue . #% I suggest a level of 50 % of women . #% The current directive on money laundering is clearly ineffective given the scale of this drug problem in the cities mentioned and in other areas and also the ease with which the proceeds appear to be laundered into legitimate businesses . #% National authorities will encourage the widening of treatment programmes . #% Mr President , this is a useful and very necessary procedure . #% Mr President , the Irish fishermen both from the North and from the South whose home waters are those of the Irish sea are now staring in dismay at what is happening to their industry . #% We propose starting with the Commission 's Year 2000 tax rate proposals and then applying an accelerator formula , subject to five-year review , but which would stay in place pending the outcome of the review . #% While some women may know they are to work as prostitutes , many do not . #% Partnership at work must be based on the firm foundation of union recognition . #% The only thing they can gain from a soft monetary policy , devaluing their currency in order to gain competitiveness , is to reduce the wages of their own people and create greater poverty for the low paid . #% I support what Mr Poettering said . #% At the outset , I wish to compliment the Commissioner on his good work in a very difficult area . #% The second point is in relation to Fléchard . #% Therefore I have to ask myself : is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards , never mind the proposed increased standards ? #% Finally I would ask this particular question : is it because the vast majority of cabin crew are women that licensing was not introduced a long time ago ? #% The institutions of this Union have spoken . #% We had a very frank exchange of views and as Parliament 's rapporteur for Hong Kong I intend to monitor the situation very closely to ensure that basic human rights and freedoms are not eroded . #% It would be wrong to oppose the directive because it does not give sufficient rights of information and consultation . #% Parliament may have the final say in signing off the accounts , but it is important to recall that 84 % of the Community budget is managed within the Member States . #% There can be no question that all future development in the sector must be on a sustainable basis . #% Each year two billion tonnes of different goods pass through European ports . #% One of the things that was not widely understood was the importance of this policy from a social point of view : the fact is , that in all the depressed regions of the Union , the common agricultural policy has maintained the population and supported communities , in a social sense , that would not otherwise have survived . #% I would like to support my colleague , Mr Cashman , and in particular point out that this Parliament has been a very active supporter of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland . #% The very fact that Ireland is currently experiencing an unprecedented economic boom must mean that we do not forget our humanitarian duty to others . #% I am referring to social and environmental concerns which this Parliament has always supported but which are not yet sufficiently articulated in the energy sector with reference to the single market . #% And so it proved to be that meddle time - happily - was at a premium . #% I believe that , while each Member State must work towards the 12 % target of renewables , the imposition of a single binding target would not be helpful because of the great differences in the structure of the energy market between Member States . #% If we are trying to build the European economy based on cross-border trade , consumers have to be aware of their rights and entitlements and how these are enforced and communicated . #% I want to speak on two or three points , firstly energy efficiency . #% Therefore I ask you , Commissioner Barnier and your colleagues , to look at the opportunities offered by other policies , in particular the real and tangible benefits of involving the private sector in regenerating our regions . #% This is a high-profile case in Ireland at the moment , but there have been a number of cases in recent times where workers ' rights , particularly immigrant workers ' rights , have been trampled on . #% A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous . #% I will continue to defend the most vulnerable in this field - the small operators and those who enjoy flying as a sport . #% In the meantime we hope that the Commission will bring about an in-depth evaluation of the criteria that it uses for the macro-financial assistance and we must do our part . #% Ratification by sixty Member States is required to achieve this and of the seven that have done so I regret to say that only one is from the EU , namely Italy . #% This regulation constitutes an important framework which needs to be developed upon by the respective Member States . #% As rapporteur , I have consulted widely on this issue and examined every option from one end of the spectrum to the other . #% One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara . #% Mr President , on the question of Sellafield and the contamination of the Irish Sea , I did not say that the article was edited , but completely excised , at the request , I believe of the nuclear industry , specifically British Nuclear Fuels Limited . #% We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma , the economic persecution in East Timor , the religious persecution in Indonesia , Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for conceiving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child . #% Finally , as my Liberal colleague said , we need to have a differential VAT regime to allow for employment creation and employment growth , in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises . #% I hope it will improve confidence and the functioning of the single European market and eliminate unfair payment practices . #% However , we can not vote for the report itself , even if - as we hope - those amendments are adopted , because of the underlying policy and belief that we in the European Union can export our over-capacity , and that we have some historic right to exploit developing countries . #% I recently visited the so-called ` security wall ' and was horrified to find that Palestinians are being walled and fenced into enclaves -- their opportunity to leave these enclaves being totally dependent on the will of Israeli security forces . #% The European Union stood by and watched the genocide in Yugoslavia ; I hope we will not do the same in Kosovo . #% I strongly support the reinforcement of the consent principle so as to give the maximum protection to donors . #% If we are intent on imposing further layers of procedure , if we insist on a whole range of modifications to animal transport , we will stretch the system to breaking point in terms of increased costs and reduced efficiency . #% Why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share ? #% We need to say more about that so the public understands the relative impact that it may or may not have . #% It will introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and will facilitate decision-making in an enlarged Union . #% It is madness from an economic point of view , too . #% This is something which the European Central Bank , in cooperation with the central bank in each Member State , should urgently examine . #% I support him completely , particularly in relation to option 2 , and I welcome the Commissioner 's comments this evening . #% How different this experience has been in the United States of America . #% I leave you with a short quotation by George Bernard Shaw , the Irish author , that I used on my first day in this Chamber : ` The worst sin toward our fellow creatures is not to hate them , but to be indifferent to them : that 's the essence of inhumanity . ' #% And we recently had great difficulty reaching a decision on that . #% Last year 390 000 people applied for asylum in the European Union . #% Now , in a quite appalling legislative move , the British Government , in delivery of a sordid deal with the IRA , is proposing to afford amnesty and sanctuary to those on-the-run terrorists . #% Those of us that must listen to interpretation for nearly every speaker are finding it very difficult to hear with the volume of these mikes . #% I shall go one step further . #% It is a disgrace that only 47 Members voted in favour of my amendment which criticized Member States which transferred their vessels to third countries which are already overexploited by the fisheries agreements or transferred their vessels to countries like Britain . #% Following on from a number of scares in recent years , tremendous steps have been taken to fine-tune the whole food production process so that nothing can be left to chance and so that our consumers can have peace of mind . #% 
The European Parliament is carrying out a very serious inquiry and the Committee of Inquiry is going to need more time to complete its work . #% They give greater security to domestic workers , simplify matters for employers and eliminate grey areas and ambiguities . #% Negotiations should restart between the Union and the Iranian Government in the context of a trade and cooperation agreement between us , and a structured political dialogue between our respective partners should also be set up . #% The core issue is to ensure the triumph of order over terror so that democratic stability may indeed be established . #% First of all , I would like to commend all those involved to date from the Commission up through the Council and indeed , back to us , but particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt , for the personal commitment she has given to this most important issue . #% Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature death and illness in the whole of the European Union . #% This is part of the ongoing framework programme to improve the quality of telecommunications services in Europe . #% The United States and Japan are jumping into markets : huge contracts recently signed in China and India by American companies for photovoltaic arrays . #% It is interesting to hear the Commission say that they should not get involved . #% Mr President-in-Office , I , like everybody else in this House , would like to wish the Italian Presidency success over the next six months . #% When we see someone with a disability , instead of focusing on the disability , let us treat everyone as equal , focus on their ability and give them the tools of information , of training , of education and of opportunity to really show how much ability they actually have . #% Let us not look to the short term , let us look to the long term , because the long term is the challenge - not five years but ten , fifteen years from now . #% Therefore , we can not support any individual amendment at this stage . #% As an Irish MEP I would strongly urge non-nuclear countries like Ireland to take a stand against this nuclear package and I am sorry that it has not so far done this . #% How does this marry with the idea of the single market ? #% That was important . #% We have tabled an amendment which would set as a prime objective the need to ensure that fish stocks and other marine species remain abundant . #% That is why I would ask you to remember - at future Council meetings , or when people from other countries say we must shelve this whole agricultural-rural issue - that there is a direct link between agriculture and rural development which can not be broken . #% Despite the initial doubts we had due to the domestic political situation , there were some significant achievements , including the end to the BSE crisis , the association agreement with Slovenia , the two Bosnian conferences to reinforce the Dayton accord and of course the start of the IGC . #% Commissioner , will the NGOs that misuse public funds -- and I am thinking , in particular , of an NGO in Ireland whose job it is to work in the developing world , which put up ` say no to NATO ' signs during the last Nice Treaty referendum -- face any sort of sanctions or censure from the Commission , particularly if they are using public funds when they should be looking after Third World issues and development issues of that kind ? #% I also wish to acknowledge and sincerely thank Members of this House for their support for the peace process . #% I presume that negotiations are already proceeding for the next agreement , as this one expires in June . #% I would not trust any information that I get from an area with such meagre resources about what is happening in their waters . #% Additionally , opponents of the Treaty have been strengthened by their electoral success in the recent Irish general election . #% The charge is that Ireland is to seek to achieve economic stability and , in that context , our last budget was deemed to be over-inflationary . #% The rest of the world will follow what the EU-25 does at the Conference of the Parties . #% Of course , rural development has a much wider remit : it provides for restructuring of rural regions and it allows for environmental protection and for measures to improve the quality of life for rural people . #% We have to make sure it never happens again . #% As other speakers have said , this is probably the most historic moment in Europe in the last 40 years . #% The recent proposals issued by the European Commission to reform the common agricultural policy must indeed be substantially changed , from an Irish perspective . #% Of course this matter is entirely in the hands of Mr Duisenberg himself . #% It is essential that the weapons inspectors return to Iraq , for Hans Blix to be allowed back in . #% The principal purpose of the Shelter Improvement Plan must be to close and decommission the plant completely , as quickly as possible . #% We have developed both informally and formally a considerable dialogue with aspects of the legislative process in the US , but as a parliamentary process it remains sub-optimal . #% The enlargement of the Union will strengthen Europe 's voice on the international stage . #% Commissioner , I think you have answered my question . #% Organised crime has become the main source of income and wealth for Sinn Féin / IRA . #% Madam President , Commission President , 1999 has been a difficult year for the mainstream EU institutions in that problems which surfaced over issues such as the accountability about the administration of various EU initiatives had strained relations between the European Parliament and the Commission . #% That is what we are now doing in our attempt to rectify the rural-urban imbalance which we have allowed to develop over a period of years . #% In saying `` postpone it '' we are saying we want to take command of what is in it - not to sweep it under the carpet . #% The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced , while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises . #% Non-food uses are also very important , and other reports discussed here tonight spoke of renewable energies and biomass . #% The Railway Infrastructure Package agreed by the Transport Council last December was the result of some very difficult negotiations . #% Palestinian freedom will not be obtained by murdering civilians -- terrorism destroys freedom . #% I found it particularly encouraging , during my visit , that the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers , as they are more popularly known published their proposals for an interim self-governing administration . #% The time has surely come for European governments to work together to try to solve this huge social , economic and political problem . #% One way , though certainly not the only way , of creating jobs is to make ourselves more competitive through research and development . #% And , Commissioner , what hope have the working people of Africa , Asia and Latin America when your Commission , only in recent weeks , cravenly bent the knee to the criminal speculation of free-booting hedge fund merchants seeking massive quick profits through outrageous speculation against the euro and Greece in particular ? #% However , nothing justified the subsequent acts of terrorism by either side , and in the current highly charged emotional situation , with the areas of conflict so widespread , it is very difficult to see a cease-fire emerging . #% The European Union has certainly adopted a series of measures to combat international terrorism in recent months as an immediate response to the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States last September . #% I acknowledge the courage shown by those who are signatories to this agreement and the role that the Norwegian Government and its Ambassador to Sri Lanka played in bringing it about . #% The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU . #% Enlargement can go ahead , but we want it to be fair and equitable . #% Reports and contributions to this debate remind us that some of our worst fears are justified . #% The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes . #% We must find ways in each case , as it arises , to accommodate both these principles . #% First I wish to reassure other victim parents , some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case , that their tragedies too are just as important to me . #% In the context of the WTO , it is vital that Europe defends the rights accrued under those regulations and does not give in to the pressures coming from third countries . #% All these are things Mr Parish has underlined . #% This is his second attempt to reach a compromise on the Consumer Credit Directive , Parliament having opposed many aspects of the proposed directive and referred it back to committee in November 2003 . #% In the short time available to me I wish to correct a remark made yesterday in plenary by my constituency colleague , Ms McKenna , and reported in the Irish Times today . #% This proposal has serious implications for Ireland ' s dairy sector and will result in a serious loss of trade , particularly in the area of the reprocessing of dairy products . #% In view of the slow-down in the US economy and consequently the world economy , it is essential that we , as legislators , do all we can to facilitate business and job creation . #% My second area of objection to this directive is its scope . #% Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha . #% If this Parliament wants to show solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland it should perhaps consider sending a delegation there for that march . #%
