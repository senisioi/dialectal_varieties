No Member State has fully met the requirements of the habitats directive , for example , let alone met them within the legally-binding timetable . #% Nobody in this House wants to vote for a situation that will in any way harm the future thriving of SMEs . #% The creation and management of European companies must take place with as few hindrances and bureaucratic obstacles as possible . #% So I would like to encourage the Commissioner to ensure that we get a speedy agreement . #% In relation to priorities , there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people . #% Just last week I presented certificates to mature students in Tullamore , a town in the midlands of Ireland . #% I understand that off-road vehicles account for about 8.5 % of the diesel vehicles in the European Union . #% With Aarhus these situations should not be happening in Ireland . #% Had the Commission been as good as its word , such a study and its consequences would long since have been dealt with . #% Mr President , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union . #% It is not their priority . #% To make mistakes will be catastrophic not just for the existing Member States but also for the countries wishing to join . #% The regulation provides for the establishment of central authorities which are not responsible for the actual transmission of documents but which will respond to requests for supplying information from requested agencies . #% In tonight 's motion , we are calling ` on the leadership of Sinn FÃ©in to insist that those responsible for the murder and the witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with the PSNI and be free from the threat of reprisals from the IRA ' , or indeed to cooperate with the Ombudsman of Northern Ireland . #% I support Mr Lange and congratulate him on his report . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report . #% Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions . #% I know in the major scheme of things this might seem like a detail , but we have a responsibility . #% Therefore , we have voted in favour of the report as a whole . #% May I remind colleagues who support the zero quota -- and I know many do -- that withdrawal of this section of paragraph 5 today , that is , all the words after ` Appendix II ' , would not preclude another party to the conference re-tabling the zero quota request , if they wished to do so . #% I am still confused about the situation in relation to mince . #% Perhaps we were a year too early , because this would have allowed us to show a dramatic improvement in meeting all targets and timetables - I am being somewhat sarcastic but it is a serious point . #% For example , the strong economic growth in the east coast region of my country is not necessarily reflected throughout all parts of the country , and the existence of uneven growth rates within a country and a region should be taken into account by the Commission . #% We must all continue to cooperate more closely in the future to ensure that the twin evils of international terrorism and international criminal activities are defeated . #% I support the call for an international inquiry into the possible use by Israeli forces of weapons of mass destruction , as was suspected in Lebanon . #% It is true that down the centuries many Member States have colonised other countries and unjustly exploited the weaker and poorer countries of the world , but in the 21st century we should realise that the imperialist approach is wrong . #% Mobility of researchers also tends to be high when there is a mix of such researchers . #% I agree with the rapporteur , and I pay tribute to him here for his interest tonight , that it is vital to ensure proper coordination between the fund 's activities and those financed under Community structural policies . #% The psychological impact on farmers and rural communities is considerable . #% Mr President , the European LIFE programme is the key European Union initiative to integrate environmental measures into the broad ambit of European Union policies . #% On the one hand , I feel it was politically motivated rather than scientifically based . #% Let us take it one step at a time , let us at least have observer status at the coordination meetings and at the meetings where the real work is done and of course be part of any press conference and press briefing that may wind up the week . #% With the exception that I mentioned , I consider the common position as established by the Council to be a very good outcome for the European Parliament . #% The EURATOM Treaty is 40 years old this year . #% I would hazard a guess that if my constituents were to be asked if this represents 100 million well spent at this time , few - if any - would say yes . #% Availability of supplements should not be restricted for any reason other than safety . #% My colleague has spoken about the end ; the end is nigh . #% Morocco is not recognised as the administrative power . #% But that is a detail for another day . #% We need to be careful that we do not discriminate against large firms because we could seriously hinder efforts in building networks and linkages of large multinational companies into EU innovation systems . #% However , we are disappointed that the IGC agenda which has been contemplated at Helsinki has been limited to what has been described as the Amsterdam leftovers . #% It did not want to answer questions . #% The significant advances made by the applicant countries in terms of enacting new EU legislation have certainly ensured that the enlargement negotiations can proceed at a stronger pace . #% Madam President , one thing that makes my heart very glad is to hear the last unreconstructed Tory of the seventeenth century agree at last that freedom is a good thing for Ireland . #% I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work , particularly in reaching a useful and speedy conclusion at second reading . #% The response to such a dire situation should be prompt and effective . #% ` Where there is a will there is a way ' . #% In the future it is likely that more and more animal feed will be derived from GM crops . #% In my country , Ireland , where we have just introduced full decoupling from 1 January 2005 , Irish farmers feel that they face a very uncertain future as regards their income . #% We have to clean up our own house without transferring our problems to those who are economically worse off than ourselves and who are desperate for any money they can get . #% Though it was called a period of reflection , its effect was to stop votes in sceptical countries . #% In conclusion , in relation to risk management , the measured and proportionate use of the proportionary principle or the political management ... #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports . #% Environmental Projects in Ireland which could benefit under the seven - year programme include waste prevention , waste reduction and recycling initiatives , development of innovative technologies with positive environmental benefits , local and regional environmental awareness campaigns and the development of special conservation areas . #% The European Union exists partly so that we can work together and give value and share our experiences . #% The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union . #% Regardless of what position individual Members of this House have on the worth of the continuation of duty-free , my group strongly supports this motion as it addresses the failure of the democratic process whereby the Commission continues to ignore the wishes of those who are elected by the citizens of Europe . #% It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system . #% I must stress again the need for rapid action on these issues . #% We are talking about the present , namely the present dangers of nuclear accidents and the present uncertainty surrounding the disposal of existing radioactive waste . #% In my Member State , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities . #% The increase in fishing foreseen in the agreement must also be dependent upon unequivocal and independent scientific justification , which must be made available to the Parliament . #% But there are some questions still outstanding . #% Following the adoption of a motion this week , I am delighted that the Parliament calls on the Commission to introduce emergency measures , including raising the current ceiling for State aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a transitional period of three years . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - Madam President , I welcome the two Commission communications on the biomass action plan and on the EU strategy for biofuels . #% The protection of our coastal zones is essential and I feel that stronger legislation is needed to ensure this protection . #% 
The proposed environmental programme includes a review of all existing technical conservation measures within the next two years , to reduce ecosystem and environmental damage . #% I am quite satisfied that Parliament has acquired an excellent President and I am equally certain that you will conduct your duties with dignity and fair play at all times . #% I hope that today 's debate is the beginning of a process of close cooperation , sharing best practice between the institutions in a close partnership of equals , to build and restore that confidence that the doctor I mentioned was asking us to achieve for him as a consumer in the internal market . #% So while we welcomed last night 's announcement from the American side of a six months delay , we are fundamentally opposed to this legislation in principle and we want to say that we think that the Americans , by bullying their allies , have not found the correct way forward . #% This report is extremely important for a number of reasons , because it seeks to demonstrate to the citizens of Valencia that this European Parliament is not only a law-making body -- which of course it is -- but also a voice of the people of Europe when their rights are threatened . #% Madam President , I rise to welcome this report which attempts to orchestrate some basic harmonies in a rather chaotic symphony . #% If unanimous agreement on the Constitutional Treaty can not be achieved , then the only alternative is the creation of a two-speed Europe . #% I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate . #% A clear signal has to go out to the Indonesian authorities that we are no longer going to accept their contempt for the wish of the international community for human rights and peace . #% I would especially point out that the particularly vicious weaponry used in January has left many people with missing limbs and terrible burns . #% They also want to hear their own stories told in their own way on their own national channels . #% This was an important consideration for us . #% Just one comment if I may : I understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum . #% However , in the intensity of debate on specific amendments , particularly relating to Article 16 on the freedom to provide services , let us not lose sight of the overall objective of what we are trying to achieve . #% Returning to your reaction , not only does your response betray the EU/EOM , it is a betrayal of the interests of the people of Pakistan , especially those who are courageously working for the restoration of democracy . #% I should also say that I would like to have seen the directive slightly stronger on the protection for redundant landfill sites , because resistance to landfill and also to incineration is very often directly connected to the fears of those who live near these sites that they will not be adequately maintained and protected . #% I urge all Members to support the retention of these important programmes . #% President , it is appropriate to reflect for a moment on how this interinstitutional agreement comes to be before us today for debate . #% My group will support the explicit salary that is referred to by the rapporteur and the majority of my group will support the European tax conclusion . #% However , that choice must fully respect the choices made by other states to be nuclear-free . #% The European Union , on the other hand , has all carrot and no stick . #% I should tell Mr van Dam and the Scottish fishermen , who are now facing the first year of closure and are creating a lot of waves , that the fishermen from my region not only took this in their stride but actually responded in a very positive way . #% This is a tight timeframe , but one which can now be achieved because of the strong progress which has been made over the last six months . #% However , let us not forget that it is our inventiveness and capacity for innovation in software and dependent technologies that can help Europe to meet its objective of being the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 . #% There has been much talk in the Council and elsewhere about the problems of dealing with terrorism , yet we forget that such a danger could exist on our seas just as easily as in the air . #% Mr President , we read about this being Green Week , and the focus of this year 's Green Week is biodiversity loss . #% I want to say straight away that I do not support the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent European public prosecutor . #% I hope that the silver lining on this very dark cloud that sits over the event will be a credible assurance from the authorities in Egypt that their security forces will act in compliance with international standards and without a disproportionate use of force in the future . #% In modern life , chemicals play an essential role in the economy . #% There are 44 000 people in Ireland with dementia . #% It is expected that this will reduce the FOC tuna longline fleet by about half . #% These two services go hand in hand and can not be separated . #% As some of you will be aware , at first reading last year I proposed that this recommendation be strengthened to include a review which would lead to a further legal framework on coastal zone management . #% It is essential , therefore , that there are international rules and regulations with regard to the treatment , respect and promotion of people with disabilities . #% When we talk about the WTO , Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production . #% Therefore , the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to analyse the lessons learnt with the DCI and to define our expectations for the future instrument . #% I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63 . #% This situation is particularly associated with football clubs and their search for talent . #% Manufacturers must be encouraged to use far less packaging material . #% Fundamental to the dream of the founding fathers of our Union , 50 years ago , was the imperative to cede national sovereignty in exchange for the greater sovereignty of a united continent . #% Unless we target resources to the demand side , we literally can not win simply by tackling the supply side . #% I think the Commissioner is doing a very good job in what is an extremely difficult situation . #% In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices . #% Mr President , I should like to ask for your permission to make a brief personal statement under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure . #% I believe we should concentrate our criticism , if criticism is needed , on those responsible : in other words , the political masters of the officials concerned . #% I indicated that quite clearly , so it would be extremely unfair to discuss the Irish referendum and not to allow speakers to put both sides of the argument on this issue . #% In a global competitive market we have no option but to ensure that we press ahead and we believe that Article 32 should remain unchanged . #% Also , although support for renewable energy is highlighted in points 3.1 and 3.3 of the guidelines , it is futile to provide support for renewable energy at a local level if national policy is prohibitive to the development of the sector . #% A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States . #% In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies . #% The Commission can support fully , in part , or in principle 8 amendments : 3 , 4 , 5 , 14 , 17 , 23 , 31 , 34 . #% The dead included a four-year old boy , a ten-year old girl and a sixteen-year old boy . #% The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic and regional cohesion and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions highly dependent on fisheries . #% This is a supplementary point . #% Tonight , while I welcome the Commission 's presentation of Agenda 2000 , I remain to be convinced in relation to certain aspects of the budget implications . #% My Group has therefore taken the initiative of calling on the Commission to present an updated opinion on Malta 's renewed application , and , as Commissioner Van Den Broek has said , to see if and how they can catch up on the past two years while the application was frozen . #% The United Nations estimates that the modern slave trade is now worth GBP 5 billion and 10 % of illegal entrants to Europe come via the Balkan route . #% We have 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors , or junior doctors . #% The only feasible third party would be a team of international observers . #% I am glad that a clear distinction has now been made between nuclear safeguards and nuclear safety and security . #% At the outset I want to compliment Mr Chichester on the preparation and presentation of this report . #% As other speakers have mentioned , it has a very unusual clause to the effect that the Council should delay the implementation of this decision until the EU Court of Justice has issued its decision on the case brought by certain French fishermen . #% Some time ago , a EUR 2.5 billion commitment to Honduras for reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch was barely delivered on to the extent of one-third of that commitment : this is totally unacceptable . #% It is very important to approach this with clarity so people can understand exactly what has been proposed by both the Commission and Parliament . #% Take the situation in the Irish Sea , where most of the fishermen from my country , Northern Ireland , have to compete to fish . #% The red squirrel -- our European native squirrel -- is now under threat through competition from a larger , more robust rival and through the destruction of its natural habitat , our deciduous woodland environment . #% 
The bottom line is that the Doha Round should ensure that average industrial tariffs outside the EU fall to less than 10 % . #% This House has expressed its concerns quite recently about the continued detention of these people without charge or trial and has urged that they be given a fair and open hearing with the right to choose their own defence counsel . #% Tomorrow it will be the Shetland waters . #% Mr President , I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to take another look at the situation with regard to the sugar regime in the European Union . #% We are looking for a greater role as a parliament in ensuring that we can conclude agreements with regard to social inclusion , so as to best respond to the needs and demands of those people we represent . #% You are not isolated . #% Fourthly , we are in favour of getting rid of useless and wasted ideologies and , in particular , we are there to take a political stance and a visionary outlook with regard to how best we can help everybody to live within a drug-free society . #% My thanks and congratulations to Mr Bourlanges for his painstaking work on behalf of the Members of Parliament . #% Madam President , before we finish the debate I should like to bring to the House 's attention the many women whose children have been abducted to countries where these women have no rights whatsoever before the courts . #% Balance is required however when voting on a certain number of amendments which would impose a large and disproportionate number of unwarranted burdens on aggregate industry benefiting the environment or society . #% Perhaps you could be more specific or perhaps that is premature , but I would say this to you , the greater the number of vice-presidents , the greater the onus to ensure for the sake of balance that some would come from smaller States . #% President Barroso rightly said that Europe stands in solidarity with our Danish colleagues , because a boycott of Danish goods is a boycott of all European goods . #% I have to advise the Irish Government to pay careful attention to this space , where our freedom is threatened , and to defend it most vigorously . #% The oral question before us was tabled by my colleague Mr Florenz and we also have a motion for resolution further to that oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on the EU strategy for the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants . #% At the request of the European Parliament , collector 's vehicles will now be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive . #% The fight against poverty and illiteracy must form the basis of any new arrangements and the acquis communautaire must be built upon in political economic and financial terms . #% If we are serious about the European model based on family farming , then we must ensure that those who operate within that framework are all guaranteed a decent living . #% ADR is a valuable way to access justice providing services and remedies which are appropriate to the cost of the item . #% This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998 . #% There was a quite absurd concentration of time limits , particularly since some of the time was lost because of extraneous events . #% It was taken out and this is just to reinsert it into the original text . #% I fully support the call in the report to link agriculture to the Europe 2020 strategy as I firmly believe that the agriculture and food sector can make a valuable contribution to future economic growth in Ireland and across Europe . #% R [ amp ] D is one element in the overall mix that determines competitiveness . #% If an agreement for a new European Treaty is not reached in or around the time of the next European Council meeting of EU leaders , then agreement may be difficult to reach in the medium term . #% We accept democracy nevertheless , because it is the only way . #% Can I take the opportunity to say that it is good that we are having this debate here tonight and getting some things out in the open . #% If we are going to have access to third countries -- which is probably needed -- it must be closely monitored and there must be tighter controls . #% We have to be careful of that and we look to you to utilise your resources and skills in those areas . #% I am calling on the British government to make a full statement on the matter . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for her reply . #% Since then , every summer , 14 000 children have been brought from Chernobyl to Ireland for a three-week break in a clean environment , to get fresh air , to live with host families , to know what it is like to live in a proper family environment , and to get medical and dental treatment . #% Madam President , I wanted to know if the Commissioner could answer my question on the positive list , please , and whether it will survive the fourth reading in the European Court of Justice . #% They have a very healthy respect for the European Union but they disagree fundamentally with the way the common agricultural policy operates with regard to all the areas mentioned in relation to food and also in relation to fisheries . #% I welcome the efforts to resolve what the President-in-Office has described as ` these dangerous developments ' . #% The eventual framing of a common defence policy should allow Member States to play different roles - which they will do in any case - and to make different contributions . #% In my view they are not crying ` wolf ' . #% I would argue that we need to look closely in Solvency II at what regulators are expected to do and separate out those two functions . #% Since the Commission is the body which initiates legislation , I urge you , Commissioner , to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up . #% I did not know how that decision was made . #% In addition , it was often difficult to identify the major priorities of any one year . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for bringing forward a report that not only looks at the problem but puts forward new ideas for the future . #% Canada has no right to try and undermine the democratic will of European citizens by taking our clearly non-discriminatory seal ban law to the World Trade Organisation . #% I have always supported the need for improved labelling provisions so as to ensure that the consumer information is transparent and effective . #% It is not something to be purloined by the EU in its desperate scramble for internal and external credibility , made more desperate by the humiliating rejection of the unwanted Constitution . #% It was regrettable that the review of the packaging directive did not deal with this properly . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for taking on the Commission and for taking it to task in relation to its glaring omissions and its oversights . #% Aquaculture is not dangerous . #% While glad to welcome many of the reforms now proposed by the Summit I deeply regret the it 's failure to reach agreement on measures for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament . #% Subjecting social policy to the same regulation as business will not work . #% Loud and sustained applause #% For that reason , it should be our primary objective now , as we enter the new century and the new millennium , to do all in our power to ensure that Iraq is the last war in the history of the world . #% I would recommend that he do so . #% I am referring in particular to certain recommendations relating to agricultural and structural funds . #% You seemed to say that it would only be in very exceptional circumstances . #% I support a European-wide political agreement concerning the identification and confiscation of the proceeds of crime in all its forms . #% We must engage Congress as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said , but I have to tell this House in my experience Congress is thinking of the November 5 elections and is not all that much engaged or wanting to engage in discussions with the European Parliament . #% Madam President , as there is time remaining , allow me to bring to the attention of Commissioner Fischler an issue relating to his decoupling proposals and the area required to be farmed once decoupled . #% To speak of justice in that country is to speak the language of torture and of systematic brutality . #% Additionally , he is strongly critical of the fact that proposals on the free movement of people and tax harmonisation have not been adopted . #% Each EU country , with the wholehearted support of this Parliament , should have legislation to ensure that , when child abusers return from their travels , they can have the full rigour of the law applied to them in their country of origin . #% That is a very welcome development . #% It is vitally important that the parties proceed with the implementation of the Roadmap elaborated by the international community , and that each side fully meets their obligations under this plan . #% It is completely hypocritical to argue for the continued torture of animals in the interests of safety , whilst at the same time allowing dangerous products . #% If we had a European Prosecutor , we could satisfy our taxpayers that we were taking matters to the proper conclusion . #% The European Union 's annual contribution constitutes 35 % of the total . #% I think this is wrong , it totally runs against the Lisbon Agenda and it is the type of thing we do badly in Europe . #% 
We require immediate progress in setting up the veterinary agency in Ireland to accurately supervise this work . #% It is important , when we are placing so much emphasis on one aspect of increasing education qualifications and increasing the opportunities for lifelong learning , that we provide a proper regulatory framework for employment creation in that area . #% When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts . #% I would like Mary Robinson , the UN Commissioner on Human Rights , to put pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty . #% I have sent in letters on the subject . #% There is something seriously wrong here . #% It is important , however , that the needs of developing countries are taken into account and that our response is proportionate and that we allow controlled exemptions . #% Commissioner , you have failed to answer my question . #% Unfortunately , research and development are still a monopoly of the richest regions . #% This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome , value and appreciate . #% With a transitional period we would ensure that the inequalities will be continued and that Members who are reelected to this House , who presently earn two times or two and a half times what I earn at the moment will continue that inequality . #% Is there anything that the Commission can do and will it address my complaint speedily ? #% However , I would like to mention the fact that the administrative board finds itself overburdened with the administration to the point that it can not concentrate on strategic planning . #% However , if 2001 is a repeat of 2000 , then no one should be surprised if fishermen lend their support to calls for emergency aid along the lines of that enjoyed by the agriculture sector for so long and by fishing fleets in other parts of the Community ' . #% Based on advice from the Scientific Steering Committee , it is appropriate that an adequate transitional period be laid down for the phasing out of the remaining antibiotics currently used in compounds for disease prevention . #% Further cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is needed to achieve an effective implementation of the control of EU fisheries policy , even if the responsibility for the control is on Member States . #% A European Union arms export control agency should be set up in order to protect the human rights of the citizens of the ACP countries . #% I find that totally atrocious . #% The report points out that at least 147 CIA-operated flights made stopovers in Irish airports including by aircraft involved in ` extraordinary renditions ' or kidnappings as we would normally call them . #% This becomes ever more worrying when we see that while the UN-nominated judges will be screened by the Cambodian Supreme Council of the Magistrate , a body controlled by the ruling party of Phnom Penh , the UN has no power whatsoever to screen the judges appointed by Cambodia . #% I have one major concern and that concerns my own country . #% The decision is based on scientific evidence and will bring some movement in the beef sector which is very welcome at this time . #% So , I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya . #% Friends of both Israel and the Palestinians return more and more depressed from that area , as I did myself after my visit there a couple of months ago . #% I would certainly urge the Commission to ensure that somehow or other Parliament is more closely involved , when we can anticipate changes like this without , of course , transgressing on the Commission 's own proper function in respect of executive decisions and negotiations with the various Member States on the detailed aspects of the proposals . #% The reality is that the EU economy needs a kick-start . #% This problem is evident in countries throughout the EU and therefore requires urgent action . #% Diplomats and politicians can not be allowed to run too far ahead of the people of Europe on the issue of future developments . #% I believe that taxation issues are best controlled by national governments and local authorities as opposed to a centralised European Union . #% Likewise , our Group will have a free vote on paragraph 7 , indent 1 , on African lions . #% It is also positive in that it considers the very important issue of animal welfare and the question of overcrowding in fish farms , and calls for some sort of stocking densities to be set . #% This can be taken as an indication of the ongoing concern of the Union about the matters which the Member has raised . #% The conflict of interest that arises if the party 's own insurers or their opponent 's carry out the settlement is self-evident . #% The one-size-fits-all situation was always going to be a problem . #% Unfortunately the Council did not have the courage to make the difficult decisions which need to be made . #% This family needs justice to get closure and completion of this saga and to grieve in peace . #% If bus and car emissions are maintained at their current levels then the average temperature could rise by 2 % compared to 1990 levels . #% Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all participants . #% We all know what our responsibilities are when it comes to the issue of combating AIDS and we must act accordingly . #% My own party in Ireland has pioneered such legislation . #% As noted previously , these additional costs will ultimately be borne in high electricity prices . #% Regionalisation does not mean renationalisation or moving away from a Community model ; it means giving communities which are bordering each other and are fishing similar species the opportunity to come together to manage those species . #% We must grasp , therefore , the opportunities that are presented by substantial economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions . #% It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve . #% One of the keys to making progress in this area is to have affirmative programmes , action plans and targets . #% Someone mentioned the EU imposing stringent measures in this sector in Europe . #% Unilateral action by the US and UK Governments endangers world peace , regional stability and undermines the authority of the United Nations . #% We want young people because we want a living countryside . #% The control of the Fund 's activities on the ground still needs to be intensified . #% No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again . #% We call on everybody who has any influence or power over his captors to do all they can to secure his release . #% The reality is that we have neglected our transport and rail systems at a national level . #% The European Commission is to be applauded in its initiatives to date and its continuing work aimed at eliminating red tape for small businesses . #% They ensure that there is equality between all the Member States and help us to guarantee that we can move forward within a framework suitable for further building and a more efficient operation of the Union as we enlarge even further . #% This means that a half a million citizens die needlessly in Europe each year because of an addiction to tobacco products . #% That greater urgency has been recognised in the Council suggestion that we should have an intergovernmental conference beginning next year , something which we subscribe to . #% Madam President , Ireland is a good example of the effective use of Structural Funds . #% Those responsible for such abuses should not go unpunished . #% The provisions for legislation that is fully aware of the needs and requirements of its intended recipients are welcome , as is the adaptation of public policy tools to the needs of SMEs . #% In development , the money would go to surveillance and scientific analysis etc. , and there should also be the possibility of an audit of how the money is spent . #% A lot of people think this is quite acceptable , but I do not think it is acceptable that the European Union should want to be a military super power . #% I welcome Commissioner McCreevy 's undertaking to propose a separate directive on patient mobility and the whole issue of cross-border health service provision . #% Following pressure from Ireland and France , the Commission provided a declaration in the Minutes of the General Affairs Council to the effect that it would submit the proposals on market access to the Council , would remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are exposed to international competition , and would take particular account of sensitive products . #% Worse still , it allowed contaminated meat and bonemeal to be exported without restriction , thus contaminating herds in neighbouring EU countries . #% I realise this is a domestic issue , but it helps to point out a failure in the existing cohesion policy . #% This also has a serious affect on immigration policies within the Community . #% 
I would hope that the Commission will take on board Parliament 's position , which is the position of the Environment Committee . #% First of all , I would like a proper evaluation , as Mr PÃ©rez Royo requested , an economic evaluation and a cost-benefit analysis on behalf of the Union . #% Where our shared environmental heritage is concerned , the financing must fit the policy , not vice versa . #% Each Member State has been allocated a certain capacity for fishing vessels in tonnage and kilowatts , but there is no requirement for that capacity to be reduced . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Harbour , for the cooperative and pragmatic way in which he has worked on the universal services directive . #% His objective then he claimed was : ` to eradicate the Palestinian terrorist threat in Lebanon ? . #% I therefore support the call on Iran to recommence the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue with the European Union and calls upon the Council and Commission to monitor developments in Iran and raise concrete cases of human rights abuses within the framework of the dialogue . #% Ireland is a nuclear-free country and must remain so . #% I am really pleased with that . #% Bypassing the Treaty with secondary legislation such as the amendments to this regulation makes a mockery of the idea that it is the victim of infringements of the law rather than interested observers -- whose motivation and support base may not always be clear -- who should be able to seek a remedy . #% Mr President , the Commission proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions before Parliament is not , as some opponents of the directive have suggested , a new phenomenon . #% The ACP countries , which already enjoy preferential access to the EU market , have expressed their concerns that the reforms will hinder and not help their economies . #% I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply . #% The issue is not about keeping people out , but making sure that , having come in , they are treated with the dignity they deserve . #% Loyalist terrorists have also made organised crime their forte , particularly in the despicable drugs trade . #% So , let us try for that . #% It never fitted properly , because we did not respect the differences in Member States and we did not trust Member States to monitor their own pollution in that area . #% It could lead to certain claims being banned by default because legislators were not aware of them at the time of drafting . #% The case for energy efficiency is clear and unanswerable . #% In the Reform Treaty , which is a very prominent subject of debate in my country at the present time , the European Union has outlined measures which will see the 27 Member States combating climate change , united together . #% Member States at the extraordinary summit this week on employment would do well to remember that . #% Anyone who believes that in today 's society we can survive without cooperating is living in cloud-cuckoo land . #% We can not do that unless there are projects that capture the imagination of our talented young people . #% As someone who has a bank account in Brussels , occasionally comes to Strasbourg , has a bank account in Ireland and travels to other countries , I have noticed in my transaction charges over the recent past huge costs per transaction , particularly here in France , as against in Belgium . #% I would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work in this area , but of course the reality is that in inner-city areas it is the voluntary sector , the community groups which are taking the strain of the government 's lack of commitment to urban areas . #% In conclusion , I would like to echo the support expressed by the Irish presidency for the compromise package agreed by the Italian presidency , the Commission and the rapporteur . #% I very much hope that this report will serve as a springboard for the much deeper discussion and analysis that we require . #% There seems to be some difficulty with the running order of speakers in the House after the changes that have taken place in the size of groups today . #% That is what the framework programme is for . #% In this context I welcome today 's report by Marianne Thyssen MEP . #% This report deals with the important broad issue of handling mercury in import , export and the storage of the substance , while giving a timeline for export and import bans . #% Mr President , first of all let me say that it seems there is no more a case for harmonising corporate tax rates or bases than there is for harmonising property taxes , wealth taxes or capital gains tax . #% The reform of the common agricultural policy is very controversial . #% Many European states do not implement the Hague Convention either in spirit or , indeed , in law . #% Clearly , though , the organisations I am working with have tried desperately hard to stop this campaign of spamming our e-mail systems . #% We must have independence within this part of the world in this very important sector . #% I believe that there is no legal basis for this office and due to the different legal systems in the Member States there is no guarantee of the presumption of innocence and also that the probable success of prosecutions would be no quicker or more successful than the present system . #% To think that what happened in Gaza with Hamas was an accident is to misread , even with the gift of hindsight , our own failures in the European Union and in the US to deal properly with the solutions that may be required . #% We have own-initiative reports because we wish to highlight issues often to do with forthcoming legislation . #% In this regard I compliment Commissioner Byrne - who is responsible for this specific area - and Commissioner Fischler . #% This has to be addressed . #% We want to ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental purposes without risking infringement or legal action . #% Is DG SANCO taking any specific action to address this problem ? #% I want to thank you and all the Members and say what a pleasure it was to work here in this Parliament over the last five years . #% It is now up to the Commission and Council , on the basis of the good faith we will show tomorrow , to keep their part of the bargain and bring forward a proposal in this regard . #% This would be a fitting way to mark the UN 's Millennium Summit . #% We have to talk about social issues , culture and what concerns people in their daily lives . #% What is a significant factor , however , is the operation of the market itself . #% Knowing your personal commitment to fisheries , I know that you will not disappoint them . #% Its roar is an offence in my view to our many long term unemployed and to our young people who get no job start at all . #% If we are going to fight terrorism , we must all work together within the law . #% This is unfortunate - plus the fact that the Rules of Procedure have left it impossible for us to submit this amendment again , which means that we can not get a registered roll-call vote on the fact that Members are failing to adhere to the whole issue of transparency . #% There have been those who in the recent past have sought to link the common agricultural policy to the financial perspective . #% I therefore rejected the first part of the paragraph , and because the plenary voted overall in favour of that paragraph , I voted against this report in the final vote . #% Finally , it is clear to me that , due to wide divergence in national laws , the resolution of this type of case requires expensive , specialist , legal advice . #% I welcome the President-in-Office to Parliament officially since it is the first time I have had this direct contact with him . #% Drugs come in by land , sea and air . #% In other words , they should be available and capable of being sold in machines , supermarkets and other outlets . #% In particular , there are two areas on which I thought you might have responded . #% Considering the numerous political and economic changes that have taken place since the Seventh Framework Programme was adopted , it is necessary to amend FP7 to reflect the situation of the new reality . #% In Sinn Fein 's view the Irish Government need to take a lead in strengthening the rights and protections of consumers . #% As I said , this is an example of a concrete measure we are taking to improve Europe 's environment for entrepreneurs and for investing in our future . #% This must include the fishermen , national authorities and scientists , and the Figueiredo report later today will deal with that . #% The Russian crisis could roll the clock back in spite of the great historic changes that have taken place . #% Surely you now understand fully the meaning of my question and will reply to it and ensure that these monies , which were illegally removed by dictators and terrorists , are returned to the people in the various former colonies ? #% I note from the figures that the cost per tonne seems to have gone down . #% 
Twice this week we have been in a situation where groups have made requests for a roll-call vote on the final vote of a report and , just before the final vote , the Chamber is told that the roll call has been withdrawn . #% I should like to refer briefly to one or two points President Barroso made in his presentation . #% I just want to make a couple of points . #% We must learn from our mistakes in regard to decimalisation and ensure that they are not repeated when the single European currency is introduced . #% Mr President , I would like in the first instance to commend the rapporteur for his work . #% They say ` Oh , there is Big Brother Brussels telling us what to do again ' . #% Furthermore , national authorities should examine ways of improving their services , and attention needs to be paid to improving early detection so that victims can be informed early that they have Alzheimer 's and decide if they wish to be cared for at home or placed in residential care before acute dementia sets in . #% I urge the Commissioner to take a sound , scientific and evidence-based approach . #% What I think happened was that the Commission just kept its head down and hoped that it would all disappear ; that it was a flash in the pan and that nobody would take it terribly seriously and nothing would have to do be done about it . #% It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security . #% We have a moral obligation to ensure not only that the quality of life of present communities is protected , but that the quality of life of future communities is protected also . #% That was one of the decisions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion on the report . #% In committee we tabled an amendment on the increasing problem of fishing vessels flying flags of convenience , which was very narrowly defeated . #% The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council . #% While we realise that the prime objective of this directive was to protect minority shareholders ' and investors ' interests against unscrupulous directors and inefficient company boards in a takeover or merger , in conciliation we achieved the incorporation of amendments tabled by the Socialist Group , which meant that this directive would have recognised the legitimate interests of employees in a takeover bid . #% We must all have respect and tolerance for different opinions , different laws and the right of any state in the EU to legislate and enforce that legislation within its borders . #% I urge the heads of State and Governments to be similarly bold in proposing a package of measures for Bulgaria and Romania that will ensure that those States too may fully rejoin the European family of nations as early as possible . #% But there are other areas where there is a lot of confusion . #% This may be a statistical aberration or it may be a situation where , for one reason or another , a greater number of the applications are for male workers . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Presidency and the Commission for the reports they have presented to us here today . #% It is also up to us to live up to our commitments . #% Violence has been used in the past to settle differences and has once again triumphed over dialogue . #% As my colleagues have already said , the SME sector accounts for over 66 % of all employment within the EU . #% There was not a single minister able to explain that . #% From 1960 to 1990 it has been estimated that one kilometre of unspoilt coastline has been developed every day and 30 hectares of dune habitat have disappeared every day . #% Why does the Commission continue to disregard the calls from MEPs , Member State governments and the tourist industry and refuse to bring forward proposals to extend duty-free for a further ten years or until all indirect taxes have been harmonized ? #% Specifically on my supplementary , there is a major concern about the medical councils in the Member States and , in particular , for my own country , Ireland , with regard to ensuring minimum standards of training and qualification for doctors and other people in the medical profession . #% In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission . #% It is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the European Union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families . #% Madam President , unfortunately most people have left at this stage but I want to draw the House 's attention to the murder by loyalist paramilitaries last Friday of Martin O'Hagan , a journalist . #% Convoys are not immune to terrorist attack aimed at stealing the packages containing highly radioactive substances . #% The Irish presidency should not allow itself to be hijacked or bullied and pressurised into ensuring that an EU constitution is pushed through during its six-month term . #% A further concern indeed is the liberalization of the electricity and gas networks . #% Scientifically , it is totally wrong to split a TAC , and that is not just my personal opinion . #% The committee of which I am a member and which prepared this report , the Committee on Petitions , equally , is a direct link with the citizen , but has a different role in that it enables citizens to ensure that authorities in the Member State comply with European rules , regulations , funding etc. . #% If I could repeat , the Council does not have any proposals from the Commission and the honourable Member may well obtain more detailed information on the up-to-date position if she places a question to the Commission . #% The two sides have to be kept apart , but the normal constraints of morality , self-discipline and the rule of law have been drowned in a seething reservoir of hatred and revenge . #% Clarity : your political vision , as expounded this morning , does not completely satisfy our vision , and you have to expand and think very much about social Europe , the environment and other aspects . #% In Afghanistan the European Union has a bigger military presence than the United States . #% Our rapporteur has already mentioned a couple of them in his own speech and in his report . #% I would like you to clarify that you are not supporting plutonium reprocessing of in these proposals . #% One only has to look at Ireland 's interest in the rural environmental protection scheme and the number of farmers participating in that scheme to see how positively we in Ireland are committed to a natural environment . #% The Commission has a responsibility to find out why food prices to consumers are increasing steadily while farmers ' product prices continue to fall heavily . #% Yesterday in the House of Commons John Hume our colleague tabled a motion supported by many Members from different parties asking for a new international tribunal to investigate that event . #% We need a real ceasefire . #% I would appeal to all national governments , including Ireland , not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here . #% The report also recognises , and rightly so , that education and training should be prioritised in the funding proposed and I believe that the allocation of resources to the development of human capital is vital for long-term investment in the Union 's future . #% We must show the way forward to be the best possible way of achieving the peace and stability we all crave for in that region of Europe . #% Europeans have an historic responsibility to clean up the climate mess we helped create . #% Let us regulate and license research in this most sensitive and important of areas with commensurate penalties for the exceptional rogue who would put self-glory above the common good and the destiny of humankind . #% My delegation or the Labour MEPs voted in favour to maintain the committee 's positions on these important provisions . #% A wide-ranging investigation and a public explanation are required by those whose concerns have been justifiably raised by this very serious incident indeed in Japan . #% Let us do the business early and let us do the business well ! #% We must be able to respond to that challenge . #% Would he not be convinced by the fact that Pakistan embassies are using this worldwide to rubbish our report and to say that there is something wrong with it ? #% Agreement at the Intergovernmental Conference is therefore not solely a matter for Member State governments . #% Unfortunately , while countries like Germany , the Netherlands and the UK received the derogations , Ireland did not . #% in writing . - I wish to record that I support this report on Extension of the EC-USA agreement for scientific and technological cooperation . #% I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water . #% I believe that this is a direction in which we must go but I would also like to make one additional point . #% As regards your role , we hope , above all , that you may contribute to closing the gap between the aspirations and reality of European foreign policy . #% Firstly , that tourism as an employment growth area be recognized . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Costa Neves for his efforts on behalf of all of us in this procedure and to say that it is a very technical and difficult task he took on : he has discharged it with great skill and shown much patience and kindness to all of us who wanted our ideas taken into consideration . #% This will be difficult to achieve as Parliament 's amendments will inevitably be seen to go well beyond the legal situation as regards the patenting of computer-implemented inventions and may indeed put us at odds with our obligations under TRIPs . #% I voted `` yes '' and I resent the implication that by doing so I am pro-abortion , anti-neutrality , pro-NATO , pro-nuclear power , pro-euthanasia . #% They are also worried that enhanced cooperation could create a first and second-class citizenship within the EU . #% 
In fact it calls for pre-arranged reviews of nuclear safety authorities , rather than a proper inspection of nuclear facilities , and that is clearly nonsense . #% I would like to deal briefly with a number of issues that I think we should be addressing in Europe , before returning to the issue of the period of reflection on the Constitution . #% I believe that , after Iraq , the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil . #% That is a tragedy . #% My own group , which is of divided opinion on the matter , has a minority who intended to vote against paragraph 8 , and did so . #% Serious clarifications must be given by the US Government to the issues that have been raised . #% in writing . - Our European leaders failed yet again to break the deadlock in the negotiations for the conference in Copenhagen . #% Madam President , I wanted to bring up the issue of a very important meeting which took place yesterday with Justice and Home Affairs ministers , where agreement was made in relation to people ' s privacy and their right to privacy , their fundamental rights in access to telecommunications . #% So , we will stop short of fully engaging in all the ambitions of this report , while at the same time not necessarily objecting to the evolution of thinking in that general direction . #% I got an opportunity to raise the whole area of human rights with the various ministers we met , and I got one concession with regard to access for the media . #% I hope that their names will also be listed in the agenda . #% ( Laughter ) I travel through Frankfurt airport and there our European passports have been described by customs as a joke . #% In conclusion , from an Irish perspective , I believe that any attempt to reduce the size of the beef herd would be contrary to our national interest . #% With the advent of broadband , the Internet is on all the time . #% We have made such complicated regulations that I do not believe they are helpful to the regions they are intended for , and they create immense opportunities for the sort of abuses that have been identified here and which we hope will be corrected . #% Stronger and more vigorous species , better known colloquially as ` weeds ' - even though they are all wild flowers - gained a foothold in the colony and began to choke off the cotton-weed once human intervention was gone . #% The Verts/ALE Group has therefore tabled amendments asking for the suspension of this agreement in the present situation , particularly because of its unequal benefit for one protagonist -- Israel -- and until more progress has been made towards realistic conflict resolution in the region . #% We need to ensure the introduction of a 100 % whole baggage screening process at all airports in Europe . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , President of the Commission , colleagues , this is an important place in which to celebrate this important moment . #% I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region . #% I have just come from a committee meeting where we voted on the principle of partnership and involving local partners . #% If we do not give the skills to our people in order to take advantage of new employment opportunities that are out there , then we deny them the real human and civil rights of participating fully in society . #% One area of ongoing concern is the need to ensure the link between economic performance and the generation of wealth , which must then be utilised for social protection . #% On Amendment 169 relating to alcohol , I support calls for a ban on alcohol advertising until after 9 p.m. , notwithstanding that in Ireland we do have a strong voluntary code in place . #% Finally , to Alan Johnston 's family and friends , I express my sincere support on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament . #% In fact , they are almost - I would respectfully suggest - weak . #% Mr President , we all have a vested interest in this report , because none of us is getting any younger . #% A project aimed at setting up a proper system for fisheries management in Guinea must be embarked upon , so as to ensure that Atlantic yellow fin tuna and big-eye tuna stocks are not increasingly over-exploited . #% Enlargement of the Union is essential for the stability of Europe . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his successful ban on driftnets , which was long overdue . #% I know that there are no Marco Polo projects in Ireland , but I intend to urge the interested parties in Munster and Ireland to look for projects that are acceptable under Marco Polo . #% Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination . #% Mr President , despite the justified criticism of the shortness of time this is nevertheless an important occasion . #% I think it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we deliver the strongest possible message that the democratic will expressed by the people of Kosovo is respected , that it is brought to a conclusion and that the European Union has a unified voice on how things should progress in the future . #% We still have a lot of work to do in that area . #% As has been said repeatedly , they are not the cause of the problems of Europe . #% The PPE-DE Group supports the middle-way approach for increased Tibetan autonomy or self-government within a united China that is respectful of cultural , religious and linguistic diversity . #% There is broad agreement on extending qualified-majority voting and codecision powers to a range of different policy matters in the domain of both the European Council and the European Parliament . #% I ask the Commission to act with haste . #% I support everything that the rapporteur has said . #% In the Netherlands we have Mr Morales-Gouvenne and in Austria we have NoÃ«l Dumont . #% Only last week the Agriculture Council adopted conclusions on the European Union forestry action policy . #% Radiation , they say , may cause a much wider range of diseases than epidemiological studies predict . #% Without genuine global cooperation , particularly from the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , the US , any agreement will be meaningless . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report on beef . #% Why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share ? #% Apart from its obvious educational dimension , Socrates has provided a sense of belonging and an opportunity for young people to share and enjoy the cultural diversity of the European Union and its Member States . #% However , it soon became obvious - and I should like to congratulate Mrs Mouskouri for her work on this project - that we are fighting a rearguard action against the passionate affair which some Commissioners are conducting with the new sexy electronic media to the detriment - for those of us who are passionate readers , as I am sure many are in the House - of the printed word . #% So far I can not see that we have obtained very much . #% Its introduction would damage Europe 's capacity to attract foreign direct investment , because the rules as such would not apply to the Member State in which it was located but would be by some reference to a complicated formula which can only be calculated in retrospect , which would damage our capacity to attract foreign direct investment . #% This would lead to products that are not organic and not GM-free being on the market labelled as organic . #% One concern I have about the Commission 's document is that it focuses strongly on aid for innovation by SMEs . #% So they used a national student ID card which was valid but this was refused . #% There are 40 Spanish factory vessels in the Irish Box as we speak . #% They are still paying that price today . #% Mr President , I welcome a tough policy to restrict the use of pesticides . #% So there is a major problem of what actually constitutes acceptable ID . #% It shows that big as the European Union is , we have institutions that are capable of dealing with the problems which arise from day-to-day . #% Unfortunately Europe 's contribution is often unremarked in these situations , and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity , not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort . #% The purpose of the exercise , as recorded in the Minutes , was to bring to the attention of the British and German Members the iniquity of her detention . #% It seems to me to be a total waste of valuable intelligence that a lot of the educational facilities and fora are left out of the negotiations on new programmes . #% in writing . - I supported this report which presents the Parliament 's view on the expenditure required for policy implementation and administration for the financial year 2012 . #% Finally , partnership is a key priority for Parliament in ensuring that the Europe we build and its policies are genuinely inclusive , supporting a People 's Europe . #% Finally , I would say that in the new Europe it is going to be important for farmers to base their levels of production on the projected quantities that will be produced in the Union . #% That is why I fully support the recommendation in this report that at least EUR 300 million be put aside under the 7th Research Framework Programme ( 2007-2012 ) to promote a higher standard of health within the European Union . #% At a national level , EU governments must ensure that their development aid policies are ` conservation-audited ' to support biodiversity and habitat retention . #% 
Neither the age of a plant nor its location , nor indeed the state-of-the-art design are any guarantee of Y2K date compliance . #% I call on Parliament to demand the immediate end of this illegal war . #% I hope that the report is adopted without difficulty here tomorrow . #% Organic crops and products continue to grow in importance as a proportion of our production and every effort must be given to assist the sector . #% I welcome the fact that authorisation of an additive will be valid for a maximum of ten years . #% We have to be more vocal in our support for the right of the Palestinian people to have their own state , whilst at the same time guaranteeing the right of Israel to its security . #% Likewise , the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament . #% However , I would like to stress that state aid rules should not be used to block Ireland or any other Member State from competing against non-EU countries for important foreign direct investment . #% I believe the resolution associated with this oral question represents a step back from existing Parliament positions , most recently expressed in the Schroedter report . #% He is an example to other Ministers for European Affairs who come to this Parliament as regards how best to engage and obtain Parliament 's support . #% Under the various insurance directives , for instance , non-national insurance companies are required to have an agent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State . #% Some of us think that nuclear energy is expensive , outdated , potentially dangerous and no solution at all to energy problems . #% I would like , on this my last occasion , to make a plea on behalf of the Commissioners from small countries : small may be beautiful , but small can also be highly competent , colourful and efficient . #% Going back to the previous question , it was based on the other article , which relates to agricultural products . #% Parliament needs to be actively involved in drafting this report in future years and not merely presented with the finished article before it is published . #% Madam President , the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends , as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban , although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view . #% Drug addiction is one of the greatest threats to modern society . #% Undoubtedly there are some Members who have some reservations about this resolution , particularly if they support the establishment of an EU defence policy . #% In an increasingly globalised business environment , the arrival of the SE is timely . #% The prospect of Ireland entering a large currency zone capable of withstanding external pressures is one which will be welcomed by most Irish people . #% Madam President , under our Constitution , the Irish ratification process requires a referendum on all Treaty revisions . #% Taking a position on euthanasia is not a responsibility of the European Parliament . #% To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy . #% It would be my hope that the European Union could play a leading role in giving those people hope of a better future . #% However , I agree with the Parliament 's amendments that remove the recommendations on automatic sanctions on Member States that incur an excessive deficit because , as this crisis has shown , it is necessary , in extraordinary circumstances , to exceed the deficit requirements in order to stave off more serious economic effects of a crisis . #% Mr President , I support the rapporteur 's position . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the work of the rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , and the Committee in ensuring that the European Parliament will have a role in supervising developments in this very technical and difficult field . #% My Group voted in favour of the Jackson resolution on Structural Funds in the environment because we believe in the principle of ensuring effective implementation of environmental law - in this case , the wild birds and habitats directive . #% Does the Council not share the fear expressed recently by the Bank for International Settlements that there is a risk of deflation if we push the price stability objective beyond what is appropriate ? #% What we have agreed in Parliament , in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , does not go far enough . #% As you know , the OSPAR commission met in Sintra two years ago and some progress was made on pollution of the marine environment . #% If Seville shows some generosity from our political leaders , our citizens will emulate that generosity in return . #% State aircraft have been exempted . #% That night , not only was a murder committed , but also the bar was systematically wiped clean of evidence . #% Without that , the clear underlying economic message in today 's report is that Italy would fail to meet a condition sine qua non . #% It is outrageous in today 's world , with so much poverty and hunger , both around the world and right here in the EU , that such a policy should exist . #% Central to any future reform must be income stability for farmers . #% The sixth framework programme will be another tool . #% Our committee will shortly be putting in place a mechanism to ensure that we monitor all spending programmes very closely . #% Sustainable fishing must be our guiding principal . #% This is something which the European Central Bank , in cooperation with the central bank in each Member State , should urgently examine . #% I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today . #% His brutal beating and stabbing was a serious and savage attack , which bore all the hallmarks of a politically motivated IRA murder . #% Mr President , we welcome the fact that the report recognises and accepts that Echelon exists . #% It is important that the terms of reference of this Convention are clear and decisive and that its conclusions in due course do not turn out to be an unattainable wish list . #% We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union . #% Kosovo , despite recent progress , remains dangerously poised on the edge of a humanitarian disaster . #% The reason why I have supported quotas is - as I am sure is the case for many other colleagues - because we can not necessarily trust our own broadcasters not to take the easy option when it comes to cheap programming . #% Mr President , 22 % of all cigarettes purchased in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are smuggled into the country . #% For example , in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked , his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike . #% The implementation of such safety systems in all vehicles will come into effect from 2006 onwards . #% When we see how our competitors behave - especially in the United States ' Farm Bill - one has to ask why we in Europe have to lie down on every occasion and roll over . #% It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States . #% Mr President , I took over the job of committee draftsman following the heart attack of Mr Desama who was originally to have done the work for the committee . #% I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism . #% On the issue of the race to the bottom , I should like to ask you to comment on the statement by the Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , when he said that when enlargement happens in January , Ireland may not open the market to workers from Romania and Bulgaria , because other Member States are not so doing and because of the concerns as to what will happen to the Irish market in relation to this race to the bottom and the rights of workers . #% As usual , she has produced an excellent report ; we expect nothing else from her . #% We all need chemicals as part of everyday life , but we also need to guarantee their safety . #% In relation to discards , this is also completely unacceptable . #% I also greet Mr Cox and extend to him as well . #% Batch numbers of this feed must be carefully recorded from manufacturer through to final farm delivery and use in order to ensure maximum traceability . #% By mainstreaming health into all EU policies , by conducting extended health impact assessments and evaluations on all EU legislation and by promoting healthy lifestyles , the EU can provide the necessary platform for joined-up thinking across its Member States . #% I wish those still in hospital a speedy recovery . #% Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that , and so should the consumers . #% In the end , there was an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament , the Commission and the Council which said that we , through our Committee on Development for example , would have scrutiny rights over the DCI , and we set up groups to carry out that agreement . #% Considering the amount of Moldovans who live and work in Ireland and contribute to Ireland 's society , this is a welcome step for the future of Europe . #% 
I also supported a number of amendments to this report opposing increases in MEP salaries and allowances . #% My Group in particular welcomes the changes that you have outlined in your statement . #% Statistics show that the overall drop in crime is around 5 % and that the police have significantly reduced gang-related crime involving the gambling industry . #% Another issue is climate change . #% Only from the outside did an accumulation of critics and a growing scandal about the neglect of children 's programmes eventually force her resignation . #% Another very important matter is that Mr Bush , the President of the United States , will be in GÃ¶teborg later this week to meet EU leaders . #% I would urge the Commission to include in the recommendation targets for Member States to meet and also annual reports on the meeting of those targets . #% Commissioner , I have listened to you answer this question on a number of occasions . #% The successful launch of the euro in recent days must clearly be an indication to the German Government that stability is the key to the success of European Union policies . #% I am amazed that so many people are arguing that by being lax with monetary policy we can help to create jobs or improve the economic environment . #% The Irish Sea -- the narrow strip of water that separates us from Sellafield -- has , because of Sellafield , become the most radioactive body of water in the world . #% The Court of Auditors report this week is a good example . #% Once again the Kosovo crisis exposes the gap between aspiration and outcome . #% Secondly , a mechanism must be put in place that better monitors adherence to the human rights clause , so that breaches of the clause have a range of real consequences for the overall agreement . #% As for the detail of the WTO proposal , what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States . #% I argued that there should be a gradual opening-up of the various programmes to all of our neighbourhood policy countries . #% Such is the level of fear and intimidation of the witnesses that the code of silence surrounding the event has still not been broken , nearly four months after Robert McCartney 's death . #% After all they deal with the same subject , and I would like to think that the same spirit will prevail in the House when both reports are voted on tomorrow . #% I am also here in the absence of Mr John Bowis , our coordinator , and would like to include my contribution on behalf of the PPE-DE Group while I am on my feet , rather than speaking again after the Commissioner . #% Surely it can be raised at the forthcoming EU-US summit and also during the ongoing negotiations in relation to this issue . #% If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe . #% This modern apocalypse is America ' s injury , but the wounds are universally shared among the community of democratic nations . #% The Commissioner has also already indicated that she has requested the UK authorities to indicate whether or not they believe they are still in compliance with EU laws . #% Those who have had reservations on enlargement in the past should realise that not only have their particular concerns been misplaced but the current crisis is in fact an argument for accelerating the agenda for enlargement . #% It recently brought out proposals to increase cooperation within the Union on international terrorism and organised crime . #% The elections which have recently been held in a number of Member States should ensure this is the case . #% Furthermore , the leadership of the KCTU 's union was made illegal through removing the status of union membership from dismissed workers . #% All of us must avoid inflaming the debate by raising issues which could be interpreted as threatening in many national capitals . #% I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas - TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned . #% The wool sector provides the potential to generate good employment in rural areas , provided we have proper structures in place . #% Mr President , the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq is to be very much welcomed . #% I thank the honourable Member for her kind words , which I appreciate . #% This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family , friends and colleagues from the church . #% INTAS is the only pan-European , EU-funded programme dedicated to scientific cooperation with the NIS countries , including involving the scientific community in Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% I do not know about you but , as I said , I was very disappointed that a figure of at most EUR 40 million over three years for 27 Member States was all that divided us . #% But with regard to the level of agreement that we have achieved in relation to the directive , I want to thank the Council and the Commission , the staff of the Employment Committee and the staff of my own group for their assistance . #% Negotiations should restart between the Union and the Iranian Government in the context of a trade and cooperation agreement between us , and a structured political dialogue between our respective partners should also be set up . #% If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the protocol , the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from other Member States . #% We must find out why countries like Sweden and Finland can do that whilst other countries can not . #% To introduce degressivity to support - at least in Ireland 's case - a new dairy com ( i.e. common organisation of market ) , i.e. coupled payments for the milk sector , is illogical , given the gospel of decoupling underpinning the mid-term review . #% However , I will not give up on that particular point . #% The Credit Union movement in Ireland and the UK is unique . #% Like the previous speaker , I come from Northern Ireland . #% The most remarkable thing about the budget for 1995 - by contrast with national budgets , which are plagued with overspending - is that we turn out 13 % below our commitments . #% I think that the citizen 's right to make a complaint is a good thing . #% We all recognise that the livelihoods of everyone involved in these industries is at stake and I have no doubt that we will all work to try and resolve that . #% Parliament must take notice of this , because if we allow Member States to contravene the law in this way it has serious implications for the European Union as a whole . #% Mr President , I wish to draw the attention of this House to a very practical matter that is specifically of concern to Irish beef farmers , but that touches at the very heart of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reforms . #% However , you must resist the temptation to let things stagnate until then . #% Madam President , it is becoming increasingly evident that one of the more significant innovations of the Maastricht Treaty was enshrining the right to submit a petition . #% in writing . - The financial and resultant economic crisis have dwelt a huge blow to European growth and the stability of the job market . #% As you are probably aware I did lobby your government colleagues , Minister Quinn and Minister Michael Lowry , in June of this year , urging that the Irish presidency should take this up as one of their issues . #% We must insist on the right to take part in all decisions made about our environment . #% In particular , renewable energies need to be promoted throughout Europe . #% It takes away our individuality and our humanity . #% So that information to this House was wrong . #% We should do it now while we have the time and the calm to do it and , as I say , guarantee the services we need in Europe . #% Now I have listened to what the Commissioner said and I have listened with tremendous interest to some of the things she did say , but she has not given us anything other than the fact that they are going to meet the stakeholders in January . #% We consider it appropriate that this progress be encouraged further and assisted through closer contractual relations with the European Union . #% Could you confirm that specifically ? #% Mr President , pursuant to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive , the agricultural sector in my constituency , as elsewhere , is being subjected to extensive capital expenditure for the purpose of radically increasing slurry storage capacity . #% Mr President , Commissioner , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , like others , I wear a badge which symbolises trade with justice . #% We note also with satisfaction the evolving situation in Slovakia and the renewed interest of Malta . #% There is growing political support for this position . #% Other World Trade Organization partners must also be willing to make a success of this round , not only in the area of agriculture , but also in the industrial services and trade facilitation areas of the negotiations . #% I should like to put a few specific questions to the Commissioner . #% 
It is early days yet for us to have a definitive idea of how this process will develop , but I do believe that you , Madam President , have been excessively cautious and I would like to raise one or two questions with you and invite you to respond to them at the end of the debate . #% The 1996 Hague Convention is an excellent piece of legislation . #% The Commissioner , Mr Kinnock , whom I congratulated on his initiative on this point , has drafted a report into this question and has seen the positive benefits which could accrue from it . #% Madam President , I also welcome today 's vote on copyright and the information society . #% These programmes have demonstrated palpable success over their lifespan and have contributed to the modernisation of the educational and training systems in Europe . #% It is through working together at EU and international level that we can do something important for children , who must be protected from such crimes . #% We must take up that challenge in the context of Agenda 2000 . #% However , I agree with the Commissioner that the answer is not , as the PPE-DE Group has proposed , to delete those requirements and , like the Commission , we will be voting against those deletions . #% Work and efforts to make progress on these issues must intensify considerably . #% I wish to concentrate on research and development . #% Our version of social partnership is in many ways ahead of the social dialogue . #% It is an absolute tragedy that the European Union is moving in this direction . #% Anyone who knows the short history of the European Union and the long history of Europe will know that proud states are not going to dance at the crack of a whip by the European Commission . #% Mr President , firstly we welcome the reduction , if not the complete elimination , of paper quotas : this is a more realistic approach . #% The potentially very good ideas with which we started the current programme have proved to be misplaced . #% Moreover , action can only follow , as a result of a justified and proportionate request by the claimant , on the authority of a competent judge or court and only for intentional infringements on a commercial scale . #% I certainly want it within my region because that is important . #% We should not set up unfair barriers to their accession . #% Products from outside the United Kingdom may be organically produced , though in truth little is known as to whether environmental damage is done in producing some of those goods . #% Effective mitigation requires a rapid response . #% In so doing , we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric . #% I am pleased that this point has been taken on board and that it has been recognised that building interconnectors is a valid way of opening up the energy market . #% As one who has served on this committee in this parliamentary term , I believe that , because it deals directly with citizens , it has a great role to play in reducing what I discussed in a school in Ireland yesterday , the so-called democratic deficit . #% Madam President , my name is not on the register of attendance for yesterday , through nobody 's fault other than my own . #% The UN Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs prohibits the use , manufacture and distribution of ecstasy , LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld . #% I believe , as I have said , that we need a centralized system . #% I regret very much that the changes which the Convention could have made to the Euratom Treaty were not seized upon -- in great cowardice -- by Member States and by the Convention . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their work on the EU budget for 2003 which now stands at almost EUR 100 billion . #% The European Union needs to support and encourage global governance reform , particularly as regards the Security Council , whose make up does not reflect the realities of the 21st century . #% We need to Lisbon-proof REACH , the Services Directive and the Nutritional and Health Claims Regulation . #% The fact that we have not been able to give it that priority in the Member States is certainly something that we all view with great concern . #% Madam President , I wish to express my thanks to the President-in-Office and to the Commission President for their contributions to this debate here this morning . #% Mr President , I have two items of information . #% This is an important directive that will , I am sure , be a vital contribution to public health in the European Union by ensuring a high quality of tissues and cells for transplantation , while at the same time respecting fundamental ethical considerations . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Ebner on this excellent report on regional and lesser-used languages . #% The people of the Balkans are entitled to full and unequivocal answers with regard to the carcenogenic effects of the depleted uranium shells which were used during the war . #% Mr President , I wish to put on record my thanks to the Minister for his willingness to engage with Parliament every Question Time and for his part-answer to my question . #% Astonishingly , the government is only now preparing to establish a coordinator for the fund , four years after its inception . #% Therefore I appeal to you to show common sense and return to the drawing-board . #% Human Rights Watch did not respond . #% It is not just our 25 votes , but the other votes that we will attract from among the 166 parties voting on these issues . #% Incidentally he was aided by the present Commissioner Padraig Flynn who was a member of the cabinet in Ireland at that time . #% Madam President , I want to support the rapporteur 's point that there could be a greater awareness of the European contribution to this fund . #% However , we have a moral obligation to draw attention to this situation and we have to stand up and be counted on an issue as important as this . #% Take Kosovo , Africa and other developments around the world , where the European Union has responded positively to putting peacekeepers and police forces in the field and to promoting other constructive developments on the ground . #% The European Union clearly has to prioritise its budgetary commitments . #% Would that humanity could only see the futility of such wars . #% Positive developments in agriculture spending underlines the effectiveness of the integrated administrative and control system IACS and the simplification of claim and payment procedures in the newly introduced Single Payment Scheme . #% In my own country of Ireland a total of EUR 125 million has been devoted to developing an environmentally sustainable energy sector . #% The final point I want to make relates to the most recent special report , which is a rarity -- special reports from the Ombudsman are a rarity -- relating to the need for the Council to meet in public when making law . #% Some of the best travel agents who have served the Members of this House are going to leave . #% The bottom line is that some countries are running up serious budget deficits , which is clearly in breach of EMU criteria . #% Are we also willing to subject our climate to the point of no return ? #% This will only happen if consumers can buy goods and services and be confident and secure that if problems arise they can be resolved easily . #% It is a matter of the privilege of this House . #% The Irish President-in-Office , Gay Mitchell , in response to my suggestion , said that proposals coming from Parliament to this effect would be welcomed by the presidency . #% The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists . #% Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system ? #% These are matters which the President-in-Office of the Council and this House need to consider thoroughly . #% Issues surrounding the external effects of the CAP will be dealt with in the context of the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks . #% However , it is true that a more balanced approach is needed . #% You talk about respecting all conditions of animal welfare and say you need a well-balanced solution . #% Ireland has one of the worst records , second only to Spain , for greenhouse gas emissions . #% Between 1994 and 1999 the state-training agency in Ireland received # 428 million for vocational training and education . #% The Liberal and Green amendment was deliberately sabotaged by people who do not want to see the system changed . #% The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011 . #% 
But if we allow ourselves to be complacent and say that we can accept a certain percentage of drug addiction , then we have already lost the battle . #% Madam President , I wish to clear up a misapprehension . #% I believe the necessary funding can be found elsewhere , perhaps from savings and some delay in payments . #% The Community shall complement the Member States ' action in reducing drug-related health damage , including information and prevention . #% Of course I support Parliament 's new emphasis on health and safety at work . #% In the interests of transparency and information to Members , we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella . #% It is clear that a large proportion of the measures needed to improve air safety should be geared towards preventing accidents , rather than providing a response when accidents have happened . #% We should not get ideologically fixed on the whole question of whether we have a common policy or not . #% Since its inception the European Union has always been based upon the values of solidarity and community . #% Such a concern is misplaced . #% The report is firm on keeping the policy an EU one , rejecting attempts to re-nationalise it . #% What is going to be left for Irish fishermen ? #% I am thinking in particular of the Vaxholm-Laval case , which is clearly a challenge in my view to the operation of the directive . #% I would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers . #% I found it particularly encouraging , during my visit , that the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers , as they are more popularly known published their proposals for an interim self-governing administration . #% We have the language skills and the necessary flexibility , productivity and labour costs . #% It will hopefully be made public very soon , but the reality is that Sellafield and Cap de la Hague were a risk even before 11 September 2001 ; the chemical plants in our midst were a risk even before Toulouse . #% Such shameful association not only diminishes those who so taint themselves but undermines what should be a united stand by all democratic parties against criminality , whether of the racist or any other variety . #% Until such time as both sides can be brought together to work out a solution then peace will never arrive . #% I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit , but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties . #% Nor do I believe we should bring in directives that are not implemented in the same way in each Member State . #% President Milosevic has a ten-year record of terror and manipulation . #% The nuclear fusion budget remains the largest single area - EUR 750 million - of energy research and proposes funds allocated to the development of the next generation of fusion research . #% We need urgently to concentrate on the public health considerations and what the position is there . #% First , the UNIFIL peace-keeping/peace enforcement mission in Lebanon . #% I deplore also his attempt to make this Parliament complicit in the decision by NATO to use these weapons . #% The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled , the British , Irish and the Nordic countries another view . #% We in Ireland have learned -- tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period -- what it is to live with terrorism . #% The fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain objects , for example teething rings . #% Your attempts to resuscitate it are as distasteful as they are ill-fated . #% Under the Spanish Presidency , negotiations for future European enlargement are continuing at a strong pace . #% The US President , Mr Bush , has already stated that he wants to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord . #% We can not expect a country like the Comoros to know what fish has been taken out . #% I come from a country that has a very bad record as regards obligations under EU environmental law . #% The decision of the British government to expand the operations of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a contentious one by any stretch of the imagination . #% A separate but related matter is that it is high time for a full environmental impact assessment to be carried out on the likely environmental damage that could arise from nuclear shipments across the Irish Sea . #% Furthermore , the local development programme in Ireland is a partnership , first of all between the European Union and the state , and secondly between the state and the social partners : business , trade unions and the rural area 's farmers . #% Asbestos is a silent , invisible killer . #% I refer you particularly to the importance of the SAVE programme . #% I believe that the European Parliament is uniquely placed to overcome the constraints of national positions and to provide policy coherence in areas where Community-level action is required . #% The emphasis in this report on decentralization is very welcome wholly from a European perspective . #% Terrorists do not respect human life , they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights . #% With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , joblessness , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that . #% What confidence can we have that the Commission will ensure that all Member States will comply and fulfil the commitments made in relation to reducing carbon ? #% The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive , which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002 . #% It is , on the one hand , necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% The outbreak demonstrated without question that the European Union 's FMD risk-management policy , and the risk assessment on which that was based , needed to be reviewed . #% This regulation , I am sure , will be welcomed by those who have an interest in the proposed incinerator in Ringsend in Dublin and will have certainly greatly facilitated those with concerns about Corrib Gas in the west of Ireland . #% in writing . - Due to a conflict of interest , I abstained from all votes . #% When farmers are suffering because of bad deals made by Peter Mandelson at the WTO talks , or when agriculture is under threat , then we need to invest in renewable energy . #% We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories , indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement . #% With regard to the recently introduced deregulation in the United Kingdom , does the Commissioner have any plans to monitor that , or any comments to make upon it ? #% It is also vitally important that the market be stabilised with the continued availability of intervention , whenever that is necessary and until such times as balance is restored to the market , and that imports and production be reduced . #% Our Irish example shows that this is clearly not the case . #% I am not particularly exercised about ferrets one way or the other I have to confess , but I rather like the line Mr Whitehead took : we should look again and maybe ask some of the experts . #% Twenty-two thousand children do not need to die each day , every day . #% I thank the President-in-Office for her reply . #% The answer again is more or less what I expected , because we have been listening to it for a long time . #% So let us have a real and honest debate . #% In conclusion , I congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question . #% However , I believe it is important for our own Commissioner for Sport , Mr FigeÄ¾ , the Finnish Presidency , the EU and the European Parliament to look carefully over the coming months at how we can highlight this unfortunate trend . #% The direct payments being proposed by the Commission are not adequate and must be addressed before we can agree . #% Ireland 's failure so far to ratify these ground rules serves only to strengthen the anti-European Union sentiment in the candidate countries , to the detriment of all Europeans . #% We had a very frank exchange of views and as Parliament 's rapporteur for Hong Kong I intend to monitor the situation very closely to ensure that basic human rights and freedoms are not eroded . #% The failure to achieve targets for renewable energy - a failure for which the United States , to their shame , are largely responsible - can be overcome with goodwill and effort from the European Union . #% Far from being a bail-out , your IMF-EU intervention in Ireland is a mechanism to make the Irish taxpayers vassals to the European banks . #% 
They are particularly concerned . #% They will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture . #% One press agency reported that many papers could not recall a more useless and shallow example of posturing with no outcome . #% The issue will certainly continue to be debated over the next year . #% In my own constituency in the Peak district , I do not think that we want to attract Siemens actually to come and re-establish itself in an area which is environmentally sensitive , where we are looking to establish small businesses . #% Instead we have seen bitter and tragic civil war between warring factions , Islamic militia and factions controlled by rival war lords . #% I am pleased with your response , but could I urge you through the Agricultural presidency to make contact with the Commission to ensure that the request is put on the agenda so that it can be dealt with during the Irish presidency . #% It must be fair in order to ensure we give priority to our poor regions without abandoning those problem regions going through the process of economic and social restructuring in wealthier Member States . #% However , despite President Barroso 's reassurances , I am somewhat concerned at the attempts being made by people within the Commission and within this Parliament , in preparation for the Hong Kong round of talks , to demand more of European farmers . #% I want to put on record that none of us dare forget that Saddam has proved by the murderous slaughter of his own people that he would use mass destruction weapons if he had the chance . #% The collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities , such as those we have seen in Madrid . #% I think we are all agreed that it is not a zero-sum game and it is in every Member State 's interest to welcome in new members because of the generation of income and the new trading relationships that will bring about . #% The establishment of a free trade area would have dramatic consequences for working people in the region . #% It is very important that EU governments and citizens are given time to reflect on the provisions of the draft Treaty . #% It has been a long , and at times faltering , road to achieving peace and no one knows that better than our own Nobel Peace Prizewinner , John Hume . #% These are essential if the twin aims of consumer security and consumer confidence are to be secured . #% We find ourselves now in the process of creating a new , minimum and acceptable European norm for the management of public affairs and Community institutions which does not permit cultural exceptionalism . #% The European Convention on Human Rights , echoed in the new European Constitution , enshrines the right to life , freedom from torture , no punishment without law , freedom of expression , the right to an effective legal remedy and the right to liberty , security and a fair trial . #% I was against it because it provided for unplanned and unscheduled increases in farmers ' incomes which they were not looking for and did not expect . #% This morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area . #% If you are not going to bring in flexibility with regard to the types of work that people want to reconcile the family and working life then you will be denying people , particularly women , the opportunity to work . #% Some may even have had FIFG money to transfer to those countries and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now proposed regulations to prevent public funding being used to transfer to flags-of-convenience countries . #% It is therefore clear that the job must be a quality job with decent pay and conditions if it is to have an impact on resolving the issue of poverty . #% In this report my group has pledged its support for EMU . #% Please tell us before you go today exactly what you intend to do to make the Lisbon goals a reality during your watch . #% They are citizens of the EU as well and it is up to the EU to do something about this and also about the illegal occupation of Iraq . #% I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report . #% Let me put on record that it is important that we tackle issues of real importance to people in Europe , not just the global issues , not just the grande politique , but real issues that affect real people 's lives . #% If you have taken legal action against a Member State , surely the only thing you should be concerned about is any kind of information that would prejudice your case against the Member State ? #% One major problem is the possibility that landfill sites which have closed at the time of transposition of this directive will be excluded from the remit of the legislation . #% The doctors ' organisations , the patients ' organisations throughout Europe are pleading with us not to specifically exclude paid donations . #% Mr President , when you look at the list of threats to marine biodiversity , overfishing is the first problem that is mentioned . #% We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity . #% Laudable as the proposed changes are , in many ways they are merely tinkering around the edges . #% This is of vital concern to my own country , Ireland , and to Finland . #% Madam President , first of all I would like to express my grave disappointment at the resolution which we have before us . #% Secondly , I welcome the commitment by the Egyptian authorities to start an investigation into what happened on 30 December . #% The artificial divide which has existed in Europe since the end of World War II has now come to an end and the peoples of east and west Europe have now come together freely as a community of 25 countries , working together with the common interests of promoting economic prosperity , democracy and the rule of law . #% The only thing incineration does , as Mrs Evans has said , is to encourage the need for more waste . #% Like all good families , we should encourage those within our family who are trying to achieve more to pursue common ideals , goals and standards . #% One really does wonder whether there is an appreciation of the dire jeopardy in which agriculture in many regions like mine , with which you are familiar , is now being placed if that is the process that is to be followed . #% Mr President , it is difficult for any of us in this House to comprehend why one human being should kill another , and yet in Colombia members of guerrilla and paramilitary groups kill each other and thousands of civilians without qualms , and in some cases with relish . #% On many occasions we wait here and you do not get to our questions . #% However , I am aware , Commissioner , that the vast majority of Member States are of the opinion that the classification of countries for SRM removal purposes should be based on an internationally recognised code set out and agreed by the EU and the many - over 150 third countries - under the auspices of the OIE , the World Organisation of Animal Health , which is based in Paris . #% We know that at least one third of emissions come from the transport sector . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner Å pidla . #% I support the proposal that set-aside be fixed at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reducing payments for land taken out of production . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply . #% For many , the duty-free question has taken on a certain symbolic significance in respect of tax harmonization and the single market , a symbolism disproportionate to its market share and substance . #% I very much welcome the fact that a draft resolution has been tabled at the United Nations on the subject of how to deal with the post-conflict situation in Iraq . #% The real winners would be the beef barons of South America , if we were to allow the European farmers to be sold out . #% We would like a statement from the Commission on this now , regardless of what this Chamber decides on and whether or not we have a debate . #% We must give hope to young farmers and encourage young people to make farming their future . #% Mr President , I welcome the fact that you recognise the need for a coordinated EU response , but I put it to you that not only does it need to be coordinated , it needs to be comprehensive and backed up by sufficient resources . #% As far as natural radiation is concerned , risks must be pointed out and reasonable precautions must be taken , but Member States should have the responsibility for drawing up the action plan , and that should give legal certainty to workers and employers in different countries . #% When we ring from Parliament I have noticed a considerable willingness on the part of many authorities , legal and social , to take these cases seriously and to give us wonderful help in the process . #% They do not have a problem with this . #% In the build-up to the summit , advocates for freedom of expression and association in Tunisia experienced increased harassment . #% This has , I believe , been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House . #% It can not , therefore , be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights . #% We had a very plain example where I come from - in Northern Ireland - over the last few weeks , where cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na in the south made it possible to apprehend , bring back and prevent entering the market millions upon millions of cigarettes . #% From the institutional point of view , I repeat the question : why has the Council , even in the preamble to its recommendations , made no reference to Parliament 's opinions ? #% Even though I have many concerns with regard the approval of many of the amendments , and also on the many inconsistencies which these have raised , I voted in favour of the report , firstly to allow the first reading process to completed and secondly , because I believe that when we return to this issue at second reading the text will have been improved . #% However , the question of taxation has to remain outside the responsibility . #% We have to ask ourselves the question : what is the best way to keep F-gases from being released into the environment ? #% They have a better understanding of fish movements and factors affecting fish stocks than people give them credit for , quite simply because it is essential for their livelihood . #% 
How different this experience has been in the United States of America . #% That having been said , I accept that not only do we need the legal underpinning that your excellent report gives us but we also need considerably more training for the judges in all our countries . #% I would like to address two points here . #% It is important that a petition signed by 1.9 million citizens of Europe should be given a hearing in this House . #% Why has the Commission not incorporated the full force of good practice from European case law into the body of this directive to ensure that we guarantee the highest social and economic standards in public procurement ? #% As then , it is the working class and the poor who are paying dearly for , and suffering the consequences of , this , whether in Europe or in the poorest countries on earth . #% I particularly want to see moves in this area in view of the newly-relaunched rural development pillar . #% As my European Parliament colleagues will know , the Fisheries Committee has been a strong supporter of technical conservation measures based on technical and scientific data . #% Forty years later , the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals : to bring people around to this way of thinking . #% In those days Parliament did not have the same power or prestige that it has today . #% I look forward to further analysis of the sector when we look at the MiFID Directive later on this year . #% Swine fever , like foot-and-mouth , does re-emerge from time to time in different Member States throughout the European Union . #% It is a disgrace that large countries in the past have not foreseen the need to train , and countries like Germany and the United Kingdom should not be having to bring in workers from elsewhere . #% Mr President , 1 January 2002 marks another significant step in European integration . #% Indeed they are benefiting from providing euro slot machines for public authorities even though Britain is not in the euro zone . #% Mr President , research carried out in the UK on consumer credit awareness has demonstrated very clearly that consumers need clear , consistent information to be able to make informed comparisons of the products on offer . #% Madam President , on behalf of all my Irish colleagues I too condemn out of hand the savages who perpetrated this appalling atrocity on the citizens of Madrid this morning as they travelled to work and school . #% Firstly , with regard to mobile workers , the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rigours of the original working time directive . #% It can not be an abortion if you are not pregnant . #% They will also know that the three MEPs in this House representing Northern Ireland met the Prime Minister last Wednesday and he told us that he was going to negotiate a package with European help . #% Tonight I also take some pleasure in commiserating with our rapporteur . #% It is now 12 months since President HÃ¤nsch appointed me as his special mediator on transnationally abducted children . #% Perhaps we should finish the point by welcoming the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES , Appendix II , full stop . #% The interests of passive bystanders like Ireland , a country which chose to remain nuclear-free and is not a transit state , are not covered by the proposal . #% Madam President , the Republic of Vietnam is in the process of transition , as we all know . #% I would just like to discuss the issue of Chechnya and our continued support for the Russian Government . #% Finally , some will say that we are standing on the edge looking into the abyss . #% You can be in a temperature of 115ÂºF in California and feel comfortable with very little electricity used . #% Like the other institutions , the European Parliament is currently considering how things might be presented for the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% This shows the concern in Northern Ireland to ensure action is taken on this issue as quickly as possible . #% Ireland suffers doubly from safety problems , road congestion and environmental damage . #% Article 6 of the same directive only requires cigarette manufacturers and importers to list the chemicals contained in cigarettes and to report on the toxicological data available to them to the Member States , who are then required to inform the Commission . #% However , unfortunately , national funding for frontline services to assist women and children is still not adequate , with insufficient shelter accommodation for those at risk . #% It is our task to reach agreement on how best to achieve this , bearing in mind the difficulties involved for some Member States . #% Is the Commissioner aware that the vehicle registration tax in Ireland will add anything between 50 % and 100 % to the price of cars ? #% You can not , on the one hand , pay lip-service to the fight against terrorism if , on the other hand , you overlook what is actually happening within a Member State of the European Union . #% It says that there can not be respect for human rights as long as there is armed conflict . #% What mechanism is in place to ensure that an individual or groups of individuals whose data has been misused can get some kind of comeback from the American authorities ? #% I firmly believe that Yasser Arafat is the political leader that the Israeli government must be negotiating with at this time , and that seeking to topple the Palestinian Authority is a recipe for long-term instability and will only intensify the hatreds between the Palestinian and Israeli people as well as between Israelis and other Arab countries in the Middle East . #% It was cowardly also . #% We need you to be able to communicate with us and with the citizens of the European Union . #% The common fisheries policy has not worked for Ireland . #% I am very disappointed that those arrangements were not made and that this is the attitude of this House or its services . #% As a result of this investment , which I fully support , the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 % . #% With reference to Ireland , we need an independent body to monitor the transplantation and harvesting of donated organs . #% I believe that anomaly has to be corrected . #% Firstly , with regard to the Lisbon Agenda , there is still so much lacking in terms of the necessary legislative framework that must be put in place to make Lisbon a reality . #% In Ireland we need time now to reflect upon this result in a calm and reasoned manner . #% The unknown quantity in regard to the external value of the euro is clear : it is the speed and extent to which the euro has the market-base capacity to become a reserve currency and what the implications of that would be in feed-back terms for internal policy , which at the moment is conjectural . #% Obviously , the new job opportunities that are going to be created in the future will be based very much on technology . #% Madam President , recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working . #% Over that period of time , that voluntary group has raised over EUR 60 million for humanitarian and medical aid for Chernobyl and Belarus . #% Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time , I shall concentrate on Palestine , because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine . #% No consumer wants to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on animals for the sake of the food chain , or make criminals of our vets . #% One of the important aspects of this legislation is after-care . #% Three quarters of the world 's opium was produced in Afghanistan last year . #% I welcome very much , as others have said , that we can celebrate the success of the anti-rabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the UK , Ireland and Sweden to change their quarantine system , thereby giving us the template that the Commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the EU . #% Yes , I support the proposal submitted and I will support the proposal that emerges , but I wish to stress that the principle can not continue for ever and support in the future can not be taken for granted as it has been in the past . #% Ironically enough , it is in the United States , where the energy star scheme originated , that we have recently seen the absurd spectacle of power cuts in California , largely because of the incredible increase in the use of computers and other office equipment with the accompanying need for air-conditioning within a framework of quite bizarre and unwise deregulation . #% The fact of the matter is that the greater the use of Greenhouse Gases , the greater the effect that this has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities not only in Europe but world-wide . #% I know her commitment to direct participation by the citizens . #% Of course it has to be reformed , but at the same time we have to ensure that the services which general interest deliver are delivered in an equitable , fair and a universal way . #% There is no regulatory requirement to check additionality on an annual basis , but as stated in the regulation , simplification requires three checks on additionality during the programming period . #% That is progress of some sort , small though it may be . #% I think that is a gross insult to those who want to see duty-free retained . #% Firstly , a strong social partnership model whereby all the actors at a national level are involved in determining broad economic policy , as well as social policy . #% 
Mr President , both Mr Watson 's and your own comments would lead one to assume that somehow an invitation was conveyed to Mr Giscard d'Estaing and that he indicated he would not come . #% The report focuses all its attention on the juvenile problem , but these discards have wider consequences . #% The two sides will not be brought together unless there is an immediate and serious third-party mediation , and the US government must be seen to be vigorously involved in this process in a firm and meaningful way , as must the European Union . #% Why are cars built in the UK cheaper on the continent just as our pound is making our exports more expensive ? #% In the absence of an agreement directly with the trader or the trading site , the consumer should be encouraged to look at the benefits of ADRs . #% The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation . #% In April the Commission officials put forward a series of proposals which would allow a level of openness of 95 % , a significant improvement on previous European proposals . #% We are a continent comprising many small countries with different traditions . #% in writing . - I am a Socialist , which means I believe that all human beings are equal . #% The critical question in Ireland is this : why did those who would normally have voted `` yes '' stay at home ? #% I trust he will learn over the next six months to become consistent and no longer tell us to accept something that he would not tolerate . #% Mr President , I do not blame other European governments for ignoring the decision of the Irish people . #% The factual situation is that China is proposing that peaceful nuclear explosions should be reconsidered at a review conference ten years after the Test Ban Treaty enters into force and that review should be automatic unless a majority of parties vote against it . #% You can not wash your hands of it and say ` Oh well , that is the individual responsibility of the Member State ' . #% This directive will go a long way and is extremely important because of that . #% It is a matter of regret for me that in my own country we have a proposed disability bill , intended to implement the framework directive , which refuses to accept a rights-based approach for people with disabilities . #% I have ongoing concerns about the number of times issues around a legal basis arise in this Parliament . #% The vast majority of the political goals that it set at the start of the year have been met and that is a commendable achievement . #% I wonder if # 150 , 000 is the prop that keeps the Referendum Party represented in a group in this Parliament by Mr Nicholson ? #% All legal advice tells us that they will find in favour of Article 175 as the legal base . #% Let us be clear that we are not matching our words with deeds . #% I therefore strongly welcome this European initiative on dementia . #% From my own personal experience , the reverse is in fact true . #% This is precisely why a feasibility study to explore the dimensions of that role would be extremely valuable . #% This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water . #% Our fishing industry is in the process of being entirely eliminated . #% The mistake that was made in my country , when the associate organisation of ETA declared its ceasefire back in 1994 , was that everyone rushed forward with political rewards for that which had been done . #% Mr President , I hoped to be able to say something before Mrs Van Dijk left . #% What I will be calling for - and I am hopeful that the Commission will take this on board - is for the basic principles of customer care to be enshrined in clearly communicated legislation that is uniformly understood and simple . #% In this context , I would highlight and support Amendment 12 which recognises the need for a generous phasing-out period for those regions which may no longer qualify for Objective 1 support but which may still need this level of funding . #% I was at another meeting at the Winston Churchill Building and by the time I got back here , the question had lapsed . #% If this is our only answer to the EU 's unemployment problem , we have a long way to go before launching any kind of humane policy . #% The current situation where creditors alone decide on how to deal with unpayable debt is clearly inappropriate and to date this has failed to resolve the decades long debt crisis . #% Its continued health is an essential prerequisite , not just for the economic health of the Union and the Member States but to their economic viability . #% I know that the US has recently opened a dialogue with various parties about prospects for confidence-building measures . #% I find it very hard in this modern day and age to understand why we have not made greater progress . #% That gives confidence to people , particularly in the peripheral areas . #% That is what it is about . #% in writing . - The European Qualifications Framework ( EQF ) for lifelong learning is a good example of the European Union doing what it should be doing in terms of promoting mobility across national borders . #% With regard to the sheepmeat sector , the Commission should , as an emergency measure , suspend the stabiliser at least on a temporary basis to enable the system to reflect the reality of the market-place for Irish sheep farmers who are leaving sheep farming at an alarming rate . #% Now , a major challenge for the future is to disarm Hizbollah . #% These new countries join with the original six that are already engaged in extensive talks with the Union covering 38 different chapters of negotiations concerning the enlargement process . #% I refer to Article 109m of the Maastricht Treaty which provides that the management of exchange rates must be done in the common interest . #% We have not even managed to control the amount of fish which is landed , and that is a far simpler task . #% As we know , doubts about the commitment of the IRA continued to exist , 10 years on . #% In industrialised countries , domestic work accounts for between 5 and 9 % of all employment , with the vast majority of the people employed in that sector being women . #% Constructive engagement was exactly the policy which Ronald Reagan pursued in South Africa . #% We want to make sure that the DCI works and that its successor will work in achieving these objectives . #% It is time we stopped this state of denial and faced reality . #% The international community , under the auspices of the United Nations and through the European Union , must bring forward a visible and viable strategy to guarantee that humanitarian supplies are delivered to the Afghan people . #% We would be foolish too to assume that the Iraqi war is a one-off war plan . #% Given the sensitivity , the Bureau , the House and the Conference of Presidents should be given a detailed account of this breakdown in the system . #% This directive is a move towards the new regulatory framework and supervisory framework of the financial markets . #% Thus exposure to the sun is a known risk , for example to the agriculture and building industries , and is already sufficiently catered for . #% Moreover , it is right that this Parliament should be consulted in advance concerning the principles and conditions for the partnerships which are to be established by the Union with each applicant . #% I fear that the potential consequences , should the downside of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our Member States to bear . #% It should not be dramatised into something more than that . #% There is no place for dissidents in this new regime and those found in breach must be strongly disciplined . #% Local communities , from the private , public and voluntary sectors must be allowed to pool their collective talents in an effort to create employment within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in their respective areas . #% I am delighted that Mr Mulder is prepared to support us in reinstating the money which was suggested for this action , which many of us on our committee think is important . #% I welcome this report ' s action call on this issue to look after the interests of these tormented victims and its emphasis on the immediate need to ensure that there is no sanctuary for terrorism in this European Union . #% The final deal before us this week is far more reflective of the reality of the Council and Parliament being equal legislators in this area . #% We could have improved the marine environment considerably and at the same time , we could provide , at least for the future , a better livelihood and greater profits for fishermen . #% We should not accept that . #% It is an important initiative and we should encourage not only the rail industry but also other sectors of industry to adopt this kind of social partner agreement on working conditions for employees . #% The Finnish Presidency will direct preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the decisions taken at the recent Cologne European Council . #% 
I am sorry for having gone on so long , but would like to sum up very briefly with the old saying ` give a man a fish and you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% Here too the new Commission - and in particular , Commissioner Patten - deserve to be congratulated , first of all for revealing to us the extent of the horror that much of the policy had become . #% We have an opportunity to get it right . #% An ongoing flirtation in this sensitive area is a serious threat to the continued acceptance of the great European project by an increasingly Eurosceptic citizenship . #% In conclusion , I want to emphasize what is said in paragraph 30 of the resolution : all those who have to take decisions which may affect the safety or well-being of children must exercise the greatest possible care and take the maximum precautions to safeguard and protect the interests of children . #% I think there are very many good ideas in this report and I agree entirely with the rapporteur , Mr ScottÃ  , when he talks about how important it is for European producers to add value and maximise the potential of their products . #% A recent study by the UK Government , which I am sure the President-in-Office may like to comment on , looked at benchmarking and our partnership with business with the textile industry . #% Secondly , I welcome what the Commissioner had to say on Cyprus and Kaliningrad . #% Attempts by the Commission to introduce premature - and in the case of milk - unnecessary reform , have contributed to insecurity and unease among farmers . #% The recent change in government in Turkey in no way alters my view . #% Mr President , I would like to inform this House that today at 13.00 hours GMT India made an underground thermonuclear test similar to the one that she conducted in 1974 . #% There seems to be a complete contradiction : we are sending people to stop the fighting in places where the weapons used originate in the countries of origin of the so-called ` fighting preventers ' . #% It is very important that homeopathy should also be included as a medical treatment within this European Community action plan on public health . #% The reform of the pensions systems in Europe has also been prioritised . #% However , I can not support the reference to abortion . #% A report by the Irish General Council of County Councils , published in June , warned that a nuclear accident at Sellafield could result in a disaster ten to a hundred times worse than Chernobyl . #% I would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect . #% Mr President , on Mrs Lynne 's report , the European Union can present a great model to the rest of the world , in particular with regard to how best we treat those who are most vulnerable within our society . #% But we must structure society so that , if women wish to become mothers , they can actually do that and bring up their children without economic pressures that drive them out of the house when the baby is six weeks old . #% I have one further question of the Commission . #% If we had received the same support from the Council of Ministers and the Commission we would have made progress . #% I just want to ask Commissioner Verheugen whether he could reaffirm what I believe he said through the interpretation : that it is absolutely necessary for enlargement to be completed under this process , that the Treaty of Nice will have to be ratified by Ireland . #% There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it . #% I believe it is important that Member States are not legally bound to deploy or accept armed in-flight security officers on domestic or foreign aircraft . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response to the question . #% This , I believe , is necessary in the European Union . #% I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do , we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect , because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely , and could be much better spent . #% I believe that the entire island of Ireland can only benefit from the developments of the last few days . #% I do not agree with the decision adopted today which seeks to give the European Union the power to impose criminal sanctions on people who breach intellectual property rights . #% If we allow imports into Europe from countries that do not ensure fair wages , we are effectively pricing European companies out of the market . #% In conclusion , the need for across-the-board standardization of responses from the national reports is essential to get a fully clear picture for all of Europe . #% In particular , the trafficking of young women for use in the sex trade is a relic of Europe 's fragmented past and must become an aspect of European history . #% Would he be in favour of referring it to our own legal services as the Commission is apparently about to do ? #% Until we have sufficient numbers of women at decision-making level , they will not be mainstreamed in policy responses and will not be adequately addressed . #% I agree with Gilad 's father , who has asked that his son 's case be addressed as a humanitarian issue and not be turned into a political football . #% This being the purpose of this report , I congratulate its rapporteur , Mr Deva . #% We also have the environmental impact on our air quality . #% Thirdly , I would like to express my appreciation for the moral support and political solidarity extended by Commissioner Patten . #% Europe is capable of supplying its farmers with GM-free grain , but if we accept the inevitability , if we accept safety studies that are not really studies at all , then farmers will be forced into feeding their animals GM because otherwise there will be no other grain . #% We have to spell out very clearly what it is and , to put it at its simplest , it is there to strengthen the Union 's policies and the effectiveness of its institutions . #% We debate the difference between commitments and appropriations and all sorts of technical details that mean nothing to the European public . #% As a sovereign , non-nuclear nation , we in Ireland have a right to self-determination in terms of our people 's health and environment . #% We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly . #% Women will be treated only by female doctors and men only by male doctors . #% However , on a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue with regard to , in particular , Erasmus students who have been treated differently in different Member States . #% We need to recognise that the continuation of food production in Europe depends on a commitment to the sector and a recognition that it can not be expected to survive the onslaught of unlimited market access by low-cost commodities produced outside the Union at different and lower standards . #% Will the Commissioner undertake to ensure , even at this stage , that the Court 's decision will be reviewed and that the Italian authorities will be obliged ... #% It is also important to factor into these calculations the huge benefits of issues such as improved security for countries such as Germany and Austria , as the Union 's external border takes a decisive step to the east . #% This is evident under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( a ) , Objective 1 areas , and the principle is very strongly adhered to in this area . #% If there had been a check with cards , maybe we could have avoided the problem of having a head count . #% Information is the key to controlling , monitoring and being effective when diseases occur , and I am glad to see that we will be looking at better information systems within Member States and between Member States . #% Everything else can be sorted out by simple legislation . #% We have already agreed this in the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive . #% I urge the Bulgarian authorities to restore our faith in their criminal justice system . #% When we -- as we inevitably do -- experience shortfalls in services , we solve the problem by hiring people from other countries . #% We need to take on board a proposal of this Parliament that we put in place a directive , not a one-fit-for-all directive , but a directive which would provide a framework for services of general interest , which would establish the principles on which they are to be provided and which would put on an institutional basis an evaluation of how those services are delivered . #% Existing minimum wage and child labour provisions should be enforced and improved . #% I welcome the consultation process and can assure colleagues that in my Member State the authorities took care to carry out a broad and meaningful consultation . #% Irish companies and other European companies are trying to make a reality of the single market and tackle the challenges of globalisation head on , and the governments touting protectionism should not stand in their way . #% We have to retain the capacity to invest and support in our marginalised groups and communities which are not necessarily in Objective I or Objective II areas . #% From there on , the entire system is redundant and farmers within the system have absolute certainties while farmers outside the systems will deal with the problems just like any other sector in their economy - manufacturing , industry , services , importing or exporting . #% The facts are sobering . #% I commend the bulk of this report to the House . #% I do not want to see European Union funds being spent on a practice that is illegal in some countries , including my own country , Ireland , and also in Germany , Austria , Italy and Portugal . #% In a number of cases , women who live near incinerators were told not to breast-feed their babies because of the amount of dioxins in their breast milk . #% Might I ask you to look at the role of the parliamentary delegations in this particular area ? #% 
They are flexible and responsive to change . #% A lot of people are talking about this , but very little gets done . #% I wish to congratulate her on her report . #% It seems extraordinary that this Parliament , which represents the people of Europe , is not addressing this question this week , given the deepening of the crisis since the Commission last spoke . #% There are a number of paragraphs that we have reservations about but , despite these reservations which we will probably revisit in subsequent discussions and debates on the issue , we will be voting in favour of this . #% Northern Ireland , where I come from , is a much better place than it was ten years ago . #% President Bush 's decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational . #% The manufacturers will have to provide a guarantee prior to placing their products on the market to ensure the financing of subsequent disposal of the products - through insurance perhaps or a blocked bank account . #% One must remember that the Ottawa Convention on Marine Pollution has at its core the principle of substantially reducing the use of radioactive substances . #% To some extent that affects how we can best utilise this area . #% When one takes into consideration that SMEs are responsible for up to 80 % of new jobs created over the past five years , this highlights the potential for job-creation in small to medium-sized industry and also the need for Parliament and governments to create the economic environment for their continued growth . #% We should recall that , from an Irish perspective alone , over 6500 Irish citizens lost their pension investments either in total or in part as a result of the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society . #% You referred to the Euratom regulations and directives a number of times , but the Euratom Treaty might as well be on the planet Zorg for all the democratic control that we have on it in this Union . #% The appropriate political levels are national governments and the eurozone . #% Heaven help us if we have a human pandemic and see how stretched our health-care services will be worldwide . #% I have practised in family law myself for a number of years and I have seen the difficulties and delays suffered by couples of mixed marriages involved in child-abduction cases . #% We are supposed to represent the interests of the people within the European Union , not simply political blocs trying to score points . #% This is nonsense talk and it is nothing more than the Sudanese Government playing politics with people 's lives . #% We have raised standards of food production ; we have environmental and animal welfare issues . #% In Brazil , the rain forest is being destroyed to grow sugar that nobody wants , so sugar-based bio-ethanol is being produced instead . #% It is now believed that the depleted uranium rounds were used by the bombers which carried out attacks on the suburbs of Sarajevo and elsewhere during the Balkans war . #% It is also extremely hypocritical in that it criticises the Echelon interception system , while at the same time we are planning to establish a European secret service . #% We sincerely hope we will be given the opportunity of sharing in the executive powers - in a spirit of codecision , I might add . #% in writing . - The Small Business Act has been one of the most proactive acts of the past three years , and it is important that the EU continues to focus on SMEs . #% To those colleagues who are seeking to eliminate export refunds for live cattle , I would ask them again to consider the trade implications of what they are suggesting . #% There is an overwhelming and immediate need to protect and care for the victims of war , to stop the genocide and to find a solution acceptable to all sides , including respect for and understanding of the needs of neighbouring countries . #% Taoiseach , you are not here to answer for your domestic policies . #% The current CAP , which has been reformed on many different occasions down the years , has become top-heavy with red tape and bureaucracy , and I rather feel that what we are proposing is to heap more misery on top of what already exists . #% The child often loses with the potential parents saying either ` no , thank you , ' or ` not yet ' . #% In our history superpowers have always been detrimental to peace . #% We have the third highest accident rate in the European Union and we have the highest fatality rate in the European Union . #% It is one of the few areas in which I have noticed that all political groups in this House had very little difference at the end of the day , and certainly our mission was exactly the same . #% We are culturally richer due to the fact that so many of these languages have survived in this multimedia globalised age and are still used on a daily basis . #% Finally on Nice - on aprÃ¨s-Nice - just to make a point . #% Nevertheless , the IGC and the new Treaty which will emerge from these negotiations could have an even more significant impact on the lives of our citizens , provided that the Member State governments keep those negotiations firmly focused on tackling issues which are of most concern to the general public . #% We must identify the experts in injury reporting and work with them to get the information that can be studied to truly prevent injuries and promote safety . #% If we are serious about retaining the European farm model referred to in the Santer proposals then we must provide suitable off-farm employment for both women and men . #% I therefore call for a linkage between ongoing EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights and the negotiations on trade . #% If this is true , it is in breach of the Association Agreement . #% The common organisation of the market in sugar has already undergone several reforms , including an agreement to reduce quotas by 500 000 tonnes for the 2000-2001 marketing year . #% However , those earlier directives were inadequate . #% However , it comes with a health warning . #% It is a real tragedy . #% The difficulty with Ireland is that it already has freedom of movement between Ireland , Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom . #% This is an abuse of that Convention . #% Because of the stigma and discrimination , many do not access treatment and help . #% , in writing . - The current high oil prices have had a severe impact on operating costs of fishermen , even forcing some to stop work . #% The ELDR also strongly urges those Member States which meet the criteria , namely Denmark , Sweden and the United Kingdom , to join the euro . #% Many thousands of women have been abused in the most horrific ways during conflict situations , as a tool of war . #% As they grow their GDP and their per capita income - which we all hope they do - so traffic and congestion will increase pro rata . #% In relation to the PPE Group 's proposal , I would say that the PPE Group should reflect on this . #% She was the mother of six children and we were all able to give her the care and love she needed at the end of her life . #% But it is equally important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters of talks , which to date have remained closed . #% The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting . #% Africa needs our help and we will give it generously , but Africa must reciprocate by treating its citizens humanely . #% In my own country , Ireland , pharmaceutical industries account for EUR 37.4 billion in exports and account for almost 40 000 jobs directly and indirectly . #% The number of community and cross-border groups brought together in projects financed by the fund reaches into the hundreds . #% I do so because of our experience in Ireland and what happened to Irish workers and the mostly foreign workers who replaced them in Irish ferries . #% This is relevant . #% It is an important European initiative and I hope the College will go for it , notwithstanding some of the sequencing difficulties to do with other negotiations which may arise . #% So we need longer-term and future planning as well as the immediate aid requirements . #% I would also like to congratulate the staff who are running the Daphne Programme . #% That is a failure on the part of our institutions and it is a failure on our own part as politicians . #% SMEs that are inventors argue that without patent protection they are in no position to negotiate with big business or protect themselves from larger companies ripping off their inventions . #% Apart from the clear health risks involved in transplanting cloned material when so much is unknown about the future consequences , I oppose the creation of human life as raw material for tissues and cells . #% This is of pressing concern considering the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico with the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill . #% 
Surely , that is the possibility of a citizens ' Europe ! #% That is robbing Peter to pay Paul . #% I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory , but can we not , with our financial and organisational capacity , reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own ? #% I protested about this earlier today and Mr Cox , the President of Parliament , has written to Mr Pique I Camps requesting that my question and nine others be restored to the order paper . #% It is important that we reflect on what has taken place , and remember that Parliament has insisted on its democratic and executive control over the Commission . #% Thirteen million hectares of crops have been destroyed which would be , I imagine , sufficient food to feed 80 to 100 million people . #% So , we are not simply talking about listening and caring , but about proper practices . #% I know that he has consulted widely with the political groups in order to make his report as reflective as possible of the various concerns and opinions . #% Finally , I want to say that in spite of all the talk about the necessity to cut back , this budget represents 1.22 % of GDP of the European Union . #% Nobody is questioning the existence of the state . #% We must also , remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts . #% It is of the utmost importance that we in Ireland do not get left behind our mainland European neighbours on the economically and socially vital issues of transport . #% As most Members will know , when Sweden privatized and introduced competition before their entry into the European Union , it allowed the previous state monopoly to undercut the new competitors and then buy them out . #% On the detail , briefly , my group wishes to add dimensions other than the economic and that now is clearly a matter of consensus . #% When you mention the reduction of capacity in the Irish fleet , you are overlooking the fact that the Veronica is the reduction and that it has now gone to a flag-of-convenience country where it can fish without any controls whatsoever . #% Our European leaders had the chance to make a just and credible offer of financing to the developing world to cover the costs of climate change , which is affecting their countries the most , but which is caused by us in the developed world . #% This is not a residents ' association , this is Parliament ! #% It is also important to say that farmers welcome the controls concerning animal food production . #% It seems to me therefore that it is something which the Commission and the Parliament should address . #% That has to be avoided . #% Therefore Member States should drop the notion that they are in some way protecting their populations by defending the idea of sovereignty , or indeed the idea that they are protecting their economies by pleading subsidiarity and proportionality . #% This also takes into consideration the fact that within the workings of an internal market there are still many social problems which exist in both urban and rural parts of Europe and certainly in my own country , Ireland . #% Mr Adam clearly indicated the export possibilities for coal technology . #% The Research and Training Networks should also be continued , particularly the flexible support they have given under FP5 and FP6 to a positive mix of both ` early-stage researchers ' and ` experienced researchers ' . #% I think it is fair , balanced and comprehensive . #% On the one hand we are calling for effective cooperation to combat drug barons and on the other we are turning the report into a charter for prisoners , with scant reference to the needs and rights of the victims of crime . #% In a question like climate change , the European Union justifies its existence . #% The normal term of design protection under the directive is 25 years . #% I do not think we have ever put our heads together to decide exactly what we mean by it . #% I urge the Council of Ministers and the Commission not to let us down in this regard . #% It deals with the psychological effects that has on those children as they grow older . #% This proposal has much merit and we will certainly look at it . #% As far as innovation and research are concerned , we look forward to a detailed Sixth Framework Programme . #% We should intervene with the Security Council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people . #% Finally , our most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia , to show them that now that they are part of the European Union , they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously . #% I would go so far as to suggest that every household should receive a copy of the draft Treaty -- certainly every household that requests one . #% Therefore , I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that this new seven-year Socrates programme is given proper funding of EUR 2 500m . #% Europe has done that for us and it is a big effort . #% But the amendments relating to the draft Statute and the points of principle of the draft Statute are put onto the annex side and the questions relating to the annex side are put on the draft Statute side . #% That council has been suspected of being involved in dumping in some of these illegal sites and the EPA , the body responsible for protecting the environment , has actually granted a waste licence to one of these illegal sites . #% I would appeal to the Commission and to the Council if they were here - they ignore the Petitions Committee , as well as ignoring Parliament - to give the resources that are necessary for these bodies to do their job . #% The issue here is whether another 120 should be allowed into this very biologically sensitive area , not just the 40 that are there , but three or four times as many . #% On Thursday we will vote on a package of priorities for Parliament 's reserve in which Northern Ireland will be accorded the priority of being the first among equals . #% Can we do some kind of regulatory impact assessment before we go down the line ? #% I believe that the European Union can make a major contribution towards tackling the scourge of drug abuse by concentrating its resources in a coordinated manner with the national authorities on tackling the international drugs trade . #% We must now support that in whatever way we can . #% I feel that this is an issue at which EU governments should look carefully so as to ensure that they can build the necessary infrastructure projects in the transport , energy and telecommunications fields . #% Besides , it is not acceptable for the EU to broaden the definition of Official Development Aid to include other financial flows such as remittances or debt cancellation measures . #% Our committee , the Industry Committee , questioned three Commissioners and sent delegations to three others . #% This latter issue is one very important matter which must be given urgent political consideration . #% Madam President , I wish to raise a matter which is not , but should be , on this week 's agenda - the foot-and-mouth disease crisis in Europe . #% Commissioner and President-in-Office , now is the time to be brave . #% A new approach is required that uses diplomacy and politics instead of force . #% This current second revision of the agreement is a great opportunity to address the root causes of the financial , climate change , food and energy crises , and to learn from past mistakes , bringing meaningful changes to the Cotonou framework , as well as enhancing ACP unity , cohesion and solidarity . #% A human right that every single person in this House would support is the right of little children to go to school unhindered and unterrorised . #% Regarding the Middle East , I would urge Minister Cowen , who is going there today , to raise the concerns of many Members of this Parliament . #% As the Lisbon Treaty clearly states , the European Union has to take account of development cooperation objectives when implementing policies that might impact developing countries . #% It highlights the dramatic rise and increase in employment in Sweden and Finland and the problems in Spain where 1 in 5 continue to be unemployed . #% This is the approach that the Irish Government intends to take in its role as presidency . #% It must be made absolutely clear that any of our delegation offices are there not simply to have a cosy relationship with the local administration but to represent EU policy in the wider sense . #% For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes . #% However , this is a most appalling case and should be followed more closely than his reply seemed to suggest , because there are other similar cases and similar convictions in Nigeria and elsewhere . #% A report just issued by Ireland 's Economic and Social Research Institute makes a significant attempt to quantify the cost of reducing gas emissions linked to global warming . #% This year will undoubtedly be a decisive one for the enlargement process and for the future of Europe . #% It is thus desirable for the Community to be represented in an institution whose goals coincide with an area of its competence , and whose Statute has already been signed by 20 Member States . #% We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union . #% 
Rather than taking up any more time , I would like to say that I will be voting against the reports tomorrow and I hope that through conciliation we can reach a more reasonable suggestion . #% Is it not disgraceful that they are having to attract people from countries where those skills are needed ? #% I have voted for this report although I have reservations about some aspects of it . #% I welcome this Commission . #% I am constantly visiting little workshops where people who used to work for big IT firms like Alcatel have gone off on their own and have decided to use their ideas - a huge growth area . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs . #% It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development . #% We must be very vigilant that we do not encourage large firms to move their research and development and innovation activities outside the EU . #% We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week . #% If the policy did not exist , if we left it entirely to market forces , there is no question but that the flight from the land would have been very much accelerated . #% The most recent survey carried out in May by the Irish Euro Changeover Board show that in my country , 95 % of people know the name of the single currency , 91 % have same prices in both Irish Pounds and the euro and 79 % know that euro notes and coins will be introduced in 2002 . #% I have some questions to ask the Commissioner , one of which is very specific . #% Although the outbreak was debated in the plenary last night there will be no resolution on the subject . #% Could you let us know exactly how Question Time is going to be organised now ? #% I heard Mr van Hulten 's reference to the fact that OLAF should have the right to investigate Members of Parliament . #% An EU directive , by setting limits to patentability in this area , could stop the drift in Europe towards a US-liberal style of patenting software as such , and indeed of patenting pure business methods . #% The said in an article that the leaders attempted to answer the question of what impact globalisation would have on the European economy and concluded that we needed more research and development and , of course , more money . #% Human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations . #% The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement , to which the EU and Egypt are parties , is also relevant , as is the Barcelona Process . #% Thirdly , the proposed sector-specific directive for working time in road transport , when finalised , will supersede this common position and will provide a more detailed regulatory framework for this area . #% Here in Parliament over the last six weeks , we had a series of hearings where we put the Commissioners-designate through their paces . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner . #% Last weekend the company placed security men on board its vessels as a bullyboy tactic seeking to force the changeover of staff . #% The very next question in my name addresses the issue of xenophobia and I do not know why it was not taken together with Question No 7 . #% In relation to the timetable , I urge the Commission to carry out further studies to ensure that the targets applicable in the EU are also right for countries at the margin , not the least the new applicant states . #% I believe the proposed amendments will improve the efficiency of Cedefop 's administrative procedures , and am particularly glad to see that they will lead to a balanced representation of men and women by addressing this issue in the whole chain of the nomination and election procedure . #% If we ignore this fact we are burying our heads in the sand . #% Some people speak of two different policies , but it is important to remember that it is a single policy with two different pillars . #% It is a matter for the Irish administration to decide how to proceed . #% The total number of Aids sufferers worldwide has now reached 40 million and continues to rise . #% The European Commission has yet to explain clearly what it intends to do to support low-cost air travel in Europe in the future . #% It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner . #% The call for an independent inquiry circles around the fact that there is considerable belief that an inquiry by the RUC into the death of Mrs Nelson will not be as rigorous as it should be because of the evidence that suggested that she feared very much for her life and for quite a long time believed that her life was in serious danger . #% How can we create confidence in our legal and police institutions to identify and prevent the flow of paedophilia ? #% Indeed , whereas we feared the Ecofin Council under some duress may unnecessarily want to toughen what has been suggested by the Commission , which we hope will not happen , we believe Parliament has just voted a set of amendments which unnecessarily go in precisely the opposite direction . #% It is consistent therefore with Agenda 2000 , and will not require changes to the common agricultural policy ; the EU level of export subsidies and domestic support in the so-called ` yellowbox ' are already below the levels of reduction commitments proposed ; the market access proposals can also be accommodated without disrupting EU markets ; and the EU is already committed to reducing tariffs and quota barriers on imports from the least-developed countries and from all developing countries , as proposed in the paper . #% The European Commission , as guardian of the Treaties , must do everything possible to ensure that the idea of a two-speed Europe does not gather momentum . #% This resolution quite correctly calls for the abolition of the Internal Security Act and any other laws that permit detention without trial . #% They may be pretty with their heads out of the water but they are not so pretty beneath the sea where they are devouring thousands of tonnes of very precious fish and food for the people of Europe . #% Thus I would have to part company from those who support a single Community scheme with what is termed ` ambitious criteria ' , but which to the industry might seem more like excessive regulation . #% I strongly believe that the United Nations must be called upon to play the central role in the political , economic and military transition in Iraq . #% The air transport liberalization programme , which culminated in full liberalization of the market in 1997 , has undoubtedly brought many benefits to consumers both in terms of access and cost . #% Now we have a new travel agency coming in to takeover , maybe to save the Community a few pounds . #% I commend the rapporteur for his work on this technical subject and agree fully that an appropriate level of insurance cover should also meet the cost of legal proceedings . #% In relation to the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca , we can support all of them . #% It is unbelievable . #% In Ireland , the only country in the European Union which will vote on the Treaty of Nice , I am informed by my constituents that the Irish Government is not providing copies of the Treaty of Nice , but only its White Paper on the Treaty . #% But if the single market is to grow , then we need to make it easier for consumers to shop across borders with greater confidence . #% Water transport is the poor transport relation . #% In particular there is the question of replacing the word `` similar '' with the word `` equivalent '' . #% With these few words , I would like to wish the discussions , if they do take place , all success and genuinely hope that they lay the basis for permanent peace in the Middle East . #% However , a recommendation to produce higher-quality data can not itself include inaccurate data . #% In many cases companies use the argument of negligence rather than saying it is deliberate but in fact negligence in its way is deliberate . #% Mr President , would the Council accept that the cost of maritime surveillance to Ireland is totally disproportionate to our size and population . #% I urge the Commission to be equally positive and to let us know today if they will support an IGC inclusion of children in treaties and an European Union initiative on Internet , to prevent the dissemination of paedophile information . #% The budgetary implementation of the reference year was almost 100 % for both commitments and appropriations which is a unique and commendable result . #% Finally , I would like to give my full support to the promotion of the European Year Against Violence Against Women : awareness-raising is crucial . #% Quite often , for example , supermarket goods are wrapped several times . #% If you can not see the role of the Commission as a body that can transcend national politics and parties in a way that will give a lead to the hope expressed in the World Social Forum , then we are wasting our time here . #% This new protocol fixes the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Equatorial Guinea during the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 . #% However , I would be grateful , in case similar incidents should occur , which they undoubtedly will , if you could contact both the Commission and the Council of Ministers , representing the Member States , so that appropriate measures can be put in place and so that both airlines and national health authorities know what to do if someone they suspect of being gravely ill is on board one of their planes . #% Perhaps we have given ourselves excessive competences over the years and taken on excessive responsibilities in areas where it was not all that fruitful and , indeed , could be an irritant to the citizens of the Union . #% Typically , these situations descend into scrambles of information from various sources and nobody knows whether they are going or coming . #% Mr President , I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism . #% If the Union and its institutions are to continue to develop and become stronger over the coming years , it is vital that the citizens of each of our countries continue to accept the democratic legitimacy of these institutions . #% There is a huge moral question about how we reject the rest , but take the best . #% 
The prize is much more than peace in the Middle East : it is world peace , because continued violence in the Middle East is a poisonous backcloth to a lot of the terrorism which continues to happen in all parts of the world . #% I take this opportunity to say to my dear colleagues from all parties in the Netherlands : your policies have tended to become like a honeypot for the criminal element in many of the accession countries . #% It is to be time-limited legislation . #% We are all aware that the levels of violence have dangerously escalated and that the excessive and disproportionate use of force has resulted in the deaths of many innocent civilians . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this is a report on preparing for demographic change . #% I am also pleased to see references in this report to trafficking and enforced prostitution , to children who witness violence , and to action specifically designed to prevent newborn children from being abused . #% I would appeal to the Members to bear this in mind when they are voting tomorrow in relation to this question of increasing the budget . #% It has been proposed that they should be opened up to a number of neighbourhood countries but , given the very good work these programmes have done in encouraging the strengthening of people-to-people contacts , a general consensus should be reached on opening up these programmes more widely , where this can be done effectively . #% The selective use of genetic research would assist in developing my country 's green image and lead to a reduction in the use of fertilizers and pesticides . #% I reject any suggestion that I have not done so . #% The aim to boost employment , productivity and social cohesion in the Europe 2020 growth strategy can not be discarded because of the current financial problems . #% We must ensure that decision-making structures are put in place at EU level which will guarantee that all decisions are accounted for . #% I believe that the international community , including the European Union and the United Nations , must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered . #% One hand does n't seem to know what the other is doing . #% Mr Belder has adopted a commendable analytical approach and is looking ahead , taking advantage of this particular moment in time when change looks more possible that it has hitherto . #% You will know , as a Member of the Bureau , Madam President , that I wrote to you and to all of the Members of the Bureau yesterday , and in that letter I cited some direct quotations from the Member in question . #% Also , it ignores the fact that in certain Member States there are very fair electoral systems . #% I understand , Commissioner , that you have already made it clear to the Irish Government , that this strategy will not result in any extra funding for Ireland . #% I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on . #% Unfortunately , when it comes to the peace process , we do not see too many women around the negotiating table ; but when it comes to peace-making and peace-building in communities and neighbourhoods , it is often women who take the leading role ; women who have an understanding that peace is not just about political statements , or documents signed or agreements negotiated . #% The forthcoming IGC is the biggest challenge facing the European Union as a political and economic body since the decisions were taken when negotiating the Maastricht Treaty to set in train the process of Economic and Monetary Union . #% We should not have to wait for the United Nations in New York to give us the go-ahead on this issue . #% Three , the de-skilling of women as primary health care providers as medicine became institutionalized in the 19th and early 20th centuries . #% We ought to focus more on improving the quality of the proposals that we put forward , ensuring that they respond to the demands and needs of the peoples of Europe , and more importantly , ensure that they lay down a solid foundation for the future development of economic prosperity , of stability and of sustainability . #% It has become more necessary now to reassure , act and deliver on the enlargement agenda . #% This represents a very reactionary response to problems which doubtless are there but which politics exist to overcome . #% Accidents occur in all industries , and we have just seen an appalling train crash in the UK this week . #% Mr President , I join in the congratulations to all involved with this matter . #% Today , I have to tell you , Commissioner , that I find you are totally out of touch with people . #% This issue must be addressed at national and EU level . #% Mr President , on a point of order , you may be aware that Parliament 's entire e-mail system has practically crashed . #% I voted in favour of Mr Goodwill 's report on the basis that it will help to further protect the environment . #% In speaking with regard to the issue of people with disabilities in Europe , we should always start with the premise that this issue is firstly and foremost a civil and human rights issue . #% Mr President , the report on safety at Sellafield , published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate , is a damning indictment of safety at the plant and falsification of safety checks there . #% For the English-speaking world I would venture to put on record that the acceptance of non-conventional medicine is a core value in that culture and is woven out of three different strands . #% There is something else , however , of vital importance to this Parliament : is this unfair competition now being introduced here ? #% Mr President , like everyone else I am very concerned about the media reports today in particular that General Mladic and various other people have now been given free rein to impose further terror on Kosovo . #% I would have had major problems with a salary increase or with the idea of an EU-wide tax system . #% Yes , it will take time and no doubt it will be difficult . #% In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology . #% Restaurants , catering and hospitality services need particular attention in all Member States . #% Remember , colleagues , that using sugar as raw material , Brazil is the world 's ethanol superpower , with an interesting ownership of the sector -- not all Brazilian . #% We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude . #% It is the refrain from Irish Government circles that : No , there is no plan to harmonise taxes , and if there were , the Irish Government would reject it . #% By action I do not mean offensive action by the military , but with the strongest weapon we have , which is moral persuasion and the economic support that we give to those areas . #% We have to stress , as you said , the need for a fair and equitable distribution of resources while retaining priority for poorer areas and declining regions . #% I look forward to welcoming him as a member of our group next week . #% This funding must not be prioritised unfairly to the new Member States , with gross disadvantage to the EU-15 . #% in writing . - With the growth of the European research and innovation programmes and those applying for funding , it is important that those who are applying for it will not be bogged down with the process and this move to simplify the programme is much welcomed . #% We are essentially undertaking an experiment . #% All of these and more are needed , but not the illusion that quick , short-term budget fixes are an answer . #% , in writing . - The ` European Cities Guide ' and similar outfits are fraudulent operations which specifically target SMEs . #% Europe has tremendous linguistic and cultural diversity and this must be capitalised on through the audiovisual sector . #% Commissioner Lamy , you know from the last time we discussed this in this Chamber that the PSE Group feels it is quite inappropriate to pursue , of the Singapore issues , investment in particular . #% The incidents that have taken place in Jos , a city that has a history of violence , are very alarming . #% The two must go hand-in-hand . #% Mr President , first of all I welcome the report . #% It should not , as the rapporteur has said , involve robbing the first pillar in order to fund the second . #% We have also ensured that compensation for the incorrect installation of goods , for example wardrobes will also apply for the protection of consumers who have been misled by faulty instructions . #% Of course the element of unemployment and poverty is very significant here . #% However , the report fails to draw any political conclusions . #% So I would ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue of the harmonization of national laws on access to legal aid for all . #% in writing . - Mrs Niebler has presented the report on renewal of the existing agreement between the EC and Russia on cooperation in science and technology . #% By bringing Turkey into the Western way of thinking in relation to issues such as human rights , we can best influence them . #% We do , and it is the Stability and Growth Pact . #% In relation to the proposed compensation package I would say to the Commissioner that payment should be fast and efficient . #% 
In your own area of Cork in Ireland they would be tickled pink to think that we were discussing the feminine side of Pat Cox in Parliament this morning . #% When we talk about the whole question of issuing currency without debt , the argument that has been given is basically that it causes inflation . #% This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage . #% It takes a while to break down prejudices , but I will certainly support any case that is brought to me on behalf of the Unionist community , just the same as the nationalists , if it is shown that they have not got their share of this money . #% I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail . #% I also welcome the commitment of the Spanish Government to promote the implementation of EU regulations and directives , which should expand the use of new information technologies into all parts of the Union . #% It concerns every single coastal Member State , in most instances in totally different ways . #% It creates jobs , it fits in with our priority of job creation . #% If we are trying to build the European economy based on cross-border trade , consumers have to be aware of their rights and entitlements and how these are enforced and communicated . #% May I say in reply to the question posed by the honourable Member that I am very well aware of the difficulties faced by sheep farmers , not just in Ireland , but in Europe generally . #% Many of my colleagues are upset that no explicit reference is made to the rights of rapporteurs . #% Therefore it is appropriate that it is probably the most important report for fishermen in the last five years . #% I want a strict enforcement of the Community control system with regard to third country vessels operating within EU waters . #% There is some confusion over the new IAEA guidelines , because the International Civil Aviation Organization 's own guidelines and requirements are not taken into consideration and that organization is very concerned . #% Thank you for all the work you have done on our behalf . #% Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels ? #% New mechanisms might need to be put into place . #% It is important to recognise , however , that while this is a very welcome step , it is a small amount compared with the cost to the world if these diseases are left unchecked . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report which deals with the Commission proposal to regulate the recovery of cod and hake stocks . #% We have paid lip service to it but have not been able to resolve the problem . #% Because of time constraints I will briefly make just two points . #% It certainly generated widespread headlines almost implying that farmers are criminals . #% I would like to thank the Irish presidency because it was , as stated in Mr Clegg 's report , positive in ensuring we came to a final conclusion . #% It is deeply regrettable that the Commission has still not come forward with the promised initiatives highlighted again and again by the European Parliament : the collective rights of employees , social security for atypical workers , protection against individual dismissal , revision of the working time directive and of the European Works Council directive . #% Yes to green jobs , digital jobs , but do not forget local jobs and , as I said , the promotion of a not-for-profit ethos , not as a replacement , but as a counterbalance to the profit-driven model , which right now threatens the euro and the stability of the Union . #% Mr President , I should like to apologise to the House for being absent when my name was called earlier , and to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak . #% From the earliest stages in the bovine TB eradication scheme , the Department of Agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing , and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably . #% Broadband , in my view , is just as essential as electricity to rural regions , and yet many parts of rural Europe do not have this basic facility . #% It is regrettable that the PPE-DE tried on a technical issue to get rid of this legislation with Amendment No 9 . #% Mr President , I congratulate the people of France and Holland on bringing deliverance to all those in Europe who value democracy and national liberty . #% Hamas rocket attacks on Israel have provoked the response it desired - counter-attacks and the loss of civilian life and a further entrenchment of positions . #% We recently voted to renew the same programme with increased funding and this will make a valuable contribution to Member States ' efforts . #% I look forward to the Helsinki Council endorsing this vital principle and other elements which will strengthen the EU ' s security and defence role . #% Mr President , whereas there is much to be said about the deficiencies in budgetary discharge here in the EU and within the institutions , I wish to focus on national misuse of EU funding . #% China is the only country in the world where the suicide rate is higher for women than for men . #% I would also like to express my admiration for the new Member States , for their solidarity and forward-looking effort to avoid the breakdown of the budget negotiations . #% That is something that does not happen very often , but when it happens it is worthy of note ! #% That has dramatically changed the political landscape in the region and the power shift has left the outside world in an unsure position as to with whom it should or could negotiate and develop a relationship . #% I feel that the time has now come for the Commission and the EU Member States ' governments to come together and collectively do something urgently about this . #% In the absence of market management mechanisms and taking into account the risks involved , the current force majeure clause could provide flexibility for Member States to cope with unforeseen events such as market failure , and avoid serious economic shocks . #% We have to show the people that we are serious about this and we have to ensure that what happened in areas like Iran and Afghanistan does not reoccur in terms of how we ... #% It can lead to a range of choice and we all support that , but we also know from surveys by national consumer councils , particularly in my Member State , that consumers do not yet have sufficient trust and confidence in the new technology to shop on-line . #% Pan-European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market , with market participants , regulators and competition authorities all playing a role . #% Madam President , our committee covers 120 budget lines , some very large indeed , including the research programmes Tacis , Phare and Meda . #% If nobody knows what we are doing , except one or two in a very vast area and a number of countries , the value of the programme will be lost . #% It was an outrage , and continues to be an outrage , that we develop these weapons . #% I wish it to be recorded here that our vote was intended to support the principle of habeas corpus . #% What must also concern us is the escalation of the conflict beyond Kosovo and into Albania . #% I do not know why , but I understand that some of the big groups in this Parliament were not prepared to stand up to the Brazilian Ambassador who lobbied last week in Brussels . #% The present agrimonetary system in Europe is a very complex regime mainly as a result of the dual rate , whereby expenditures increase due to CAP conversion rates which are higher at times than market values . #% The second is to ensure that the commitments we are making will be met , and the third is to talk about property rights and the vulnerability of people living , for example , in shacks built on property they do not own . #% I have recently been warned by research scientists in my own constituency who have visited South-East Asia that we are kidding ourselves if we imagine that they are not about to overtake us . #% This is an urgent matter . #% Is this not what employers want ? #% The programme showed that , unfortunately , Ireland is one of a small number of countries that has failed to implement various EU directives on combating trafficking . #% Mr President , I wish to draw attention to this magazine called the Parliament magazine which purports to be a record , and to represent the opinions , of this House . #% The British - with due respect to all States in the Union - sent warships to Icelandic waters to ensure that their fishermen were protected when going there to fish the stocks in Icelandic waters . #% The Irish Government must act more swiftly to ensure that this aid is granted directly to those who need it , that it is not used to replace government funding , and that the training and re-skilling programmes offered are suited to the workers ' needs . #% Let me raise an issue with you in the Commission . #% Mr President , I strongly support Mr Stevenson and congratulate him on an excellent report . #% Madam President , I fundamentally disagree with many of the aspects of the European Commission 's proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy . #% We wish him well and we want to see him succeed . #% Our message , therefore , is that we are stepping up our action and closing down these sites . #% The Union as a political entity has a moral and legal obligation to ensure that a clean environment is protected and promoted under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty . #% Now the same principle must be applied to post-trading infrastructure . #% Regions that have just emerged from a state of low economic development usually suffer from serious deficiencies in their infrastructure . #% 
With good conservation and better practices , we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing . #% I want also to recognize the efforts of the American President in this . #% Therefore , it is really important that we pursue in good faith to bring the negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to fruition . #% We also have to recognize that our detox and treatment programmes must include not just detox but also an element of teaching life-skills . #% When we look at the Council meeting and the results from it , there have been some successes . #% That is why we , in conjunction with the EDN Group and Mr Macartney , have proposed an amendment calling for a mid-term review of the agreement . #% We must bear in mind that the European Union imports 52 % of its total fish consumption from third countries . #% As a result the Group favours maintaining Article 235 as an instrument capable of responding to the inherent , evolutionary character to interpret the objectives of the Union . ' #% It should also allow for greater transparency and accountability . #% Not every Member State takes the same view . #% This lack of joined-up thinking between two different sectors or two different parts of the DG in the Commission upsets me , because it is really part of tomorrow 's debate as well and I would just like to make that point very clear . #% The system needs to be reformed , and in such a way that we can take a credible stand and show that we are not getting extra privileges that our own voters are not entitled to . #% Firstly , the European Council should make the issue a top priority at its summit meeting later this month . #% Finally , I should like to ask whether it is the politics of the scientific community or the science of the political community that is holding up the SAM legislation , because every time we delay these things , again we raise doubts in the consumer 's mind . #% Salman Rushdie 's death penalty has not really been lifted . #% If we need that money to run our country -- and that is a matter for our national government -- it must still be collected from the motoring public . #% We have a right to ask questions and demand answers from the US authorities . #% The Charter should be legally binding and enforceable under EU law . #% Second , the only cases of human transmission of bird flu have been where people were in close contact with commercial flocks . #% So why does it need to be put off until December ? #% It is an unfortunate technical slip-up , but I accept it was an honest mistake . #% Given the recent comments by Lotte Leicht in the European Voice that the EU has been weak in implementing human rights and democracy clauses , the lack of response is appalling . #% Mr President , I will send you the details of this proposal and ask you to consider them and to raise this matter with President Uribe when you meet him . #% This and other issues should have a democratic airing and this is the place to do so at a European level . #% Would a shorter period be more beneficial to allow for an earlier review and to take into account developments arising from enlargement ? #% We have quite considerable concern recently expressed in Ireland at the very small number of accessible buses . #% Over the last couple of years , information exchange in the area of judicial and law-enforcement cooperation has become a high priority for the European Union and its Member States in the crime-prevention and crime-fighting potential . #% The disabled will be excluded from the opportunities if there are not sufficient guarantees of access across Europe to public payphones , directory services and electronic programme options . #% Tomorrow we will vote on a compromise package of 21 amendments . #% In the eyes of the Timorese he is the Nelson Mandela of East Timor . #% But I do not believe they are so concerned . #% Secondly , the Commission must coordinate future and past research results relating to the disease and be prepared to coordinate with the World Health Organization associations and organizations active in this sector , including families and carers . #% We have the moral , ethical and political duty to act . #% At that time the idea of the spy-in-the-sky was an emotive issue . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom as President-in-Office of the Council to Parliament this morning . #% Mr President , I am aware of the concept of irreversibility of membership of the European Union . #% I commend the rapporteur , Mr Whitehead , and the shadow rapporteur , Mr Bowis , for a job well done throughout the discussion in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% I find it unacceptable that out of 14 speakers , 11 were on the speakers ' list . #% Mr President , the UN sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction , claiming at least 200 children 's lives every day . #% It remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved . #% By any standards these comments are excessive , unfair and , in the context of the discharge procedure , wholly unsuitable . #% I would like to ask the Minister to clarify , in the light of recent decisions , the position with regard to decoupling and compulsory modulation . #% In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State . #% It is for others to justify why they endorsed it . #% If the Commissioner is not in a position to provide me with the information today , will he undertake to write to me on that subject ? #% It is clear that any agreement will have far-reaching implications , not just for our future relationship with the Republic of South Africa but also with its neighbouring countries . #% The long-term effect of the common agricultural policy in that sense will be greater than people have often imagined . #% The challenge is to formulate a common fisheries policy which maintains jobs and fish stocks at the same time . #% The majority of consumers no longer use travel packages if they have found cheaper methods to go on holiday and see the world . #% Mr President , not for the first time in this House I have the opportunity to express concern with regard to the safety of nuclear installations , and in particular those with an established record of poor management , since they put the lives and health of millions of citizens at risk . #% Ireland 's future relationship with the European Union is a critically important matter . #% Whilst some new initiatives are mentioned , such as a data centre for natural resources , a high-level forum and an international panel , the proposed time horizon of 25 years is totally unacceptable . #% Everybody has been very supportive of Ambassador Moratinos today , but I believe that we in the European Union have been totally sidelined in the process . #% But if I am a dark-haired , brown-eyed , dark-skinned southern European , I could spend six or seven hours in the sunshine to no effect at all . #% UNIFIL procured for South Lebanon decades of stability , notwithstanding the horrific civil war which that country endured until recently . #% If the intention is not honoured , the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith . #% An enlarged unreformed community has a permanently increased exposure to disagreements which could stultify progress to our ultimate goal of a United States of Europe . #% Spiralling costs of basic services such as gas and electricity , or outrageous mobile phone and roaming charges continue to hit Irish consumers hard . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45 . #% This is an airline that has made # IRL 35 million profit in the last year . #% Closing GuantÃ¡namo is not the answer because many prisoners transferred will be tortured elsewhere . #% This applies very strongly to the points on the black rhinoceros and the leopard . #% The main export sectors that will be affected include pharmaceuticals , ICT , medical devices , dairy and other food products . #% Vision and political will have brought us to the threshold of launching the euro in 71 days ' time . #% Ironically , by comparison , the Presidency strongly criticised the elections in Togo on 27 October , where there was no EU observation mission , yet you chose to ignore the conclusion of the Pakistan mission that had been operating for two and a half months . #% Commissioner , you have not given any guarantee that you would support this policy . #% 
Firstly , this Parliament has a responsibility to highlight and condemn actions taken by authorities that are a blatant and tragic breach of peoples ' human rights , particularly when these events occur in the EU neighbourhood and with countries that we are working with through cooperation and/or association agreements . #% A region is not about its boundaries , it is about its cultures and its languages , and , even more so , it is about its people . #% That is my appeal - to reflect overnight and tomorrow to put our collective weight behind what is available , for that is what we shall work with . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I welcome this debate , which offers the opportunity to once again draw attention to the necessity of including and honouring child-labour provisions in all EU trade agreements . #% A further 67 FOC longliners built in Taiwan will be repatriated to replace older vessels , with no overall increase in fleet capacity . #% However , we discovered when looking at the Commission documentation , which as I said was provided very late - in fact , only this week - that it actually deals with military-grade plutonium and research into that . #% Aid to the developing world must be in addition to Overseas Development Aid or risk not attaining the Millennium Development Goals . #% He clearly tried to give the impression that those opposing this were just spokespeople for the industries that produce food supplements . #% People still do not feel adequately protected . #% The Euratom Atomic Energy Community was founded in 1957 and is now well past its sell-by date . #% The European Union must continue to use every diplomatic avenue open to it to help halt the war in Chechnya . #% This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity . #% We need , for instance , to increase the size of the Drugs Squad . #% I believe that the EU environment ministers appear to have already reached a ` common orientation ' on this Directive in June 2002 . #% Can I first of all welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work in bringing forward this report ? #% At the very least a ban on cadmium in household batteries would help to reduce cadmium levels and promote the use of alternatives in batteries over time . #% I also call on the Commission to support Commissioner Byrne as he strives to be pro-active in public healthcare by ensuring that patient care and the health and training of non-consultant hospital doctors is protected . #% However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future . #% As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached , it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures . #% This in turn will send out a positive message from the European Union that it is actually supporting measures which promote air travel at a competitive price and help the consumers of Europe . #% Where the original proposal was limited to CO2 , I am pleased that we in Parliament are more ambitious and intend to extend the scope of application to all other greenhouse gases . #% It would impose unnecessary bureaucracy on an already highly competitive and successful UK ports market . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating and thanking the rapporteur , Mr Mantovani , for his work , and also to thank the Commission for coming forward with the proposal . #% These new roles -- of selling the Treaty , of ensuring that the citizens understand its benefits and of ensuring that we show the peoples of Europe that it does not undermine their own national interests -- will help us guarantee that the European Union functions smoothly . #% This is a very short-sighted view , not least because the Polish and Irish examples disprove it . #% The EU is a major legal market . #% Kyoto is only a first step towards addressing global warming but it provides a crucial foundation on which future , more comprehensive and effective policies and agreements must be built . #% It is not that the Parliament should be first among equals , but from now on it must be an equal among equals . #% This is an important area where we can bring all the actors together , including the manufacturers of equipment who can put in place certain things that can help us . #% It seems to me that it is not quite so biddable as many in the coalition suggested or hoped . #% I think it is wrong that there should be a clash between Question Time and committee meetings . #% That is not a superb victory for the cause of research and development . #% I am fairly sceptical about allowing the regulators to do that through the Florence work . #% In addition , if we are to shut down or refuse investment from every company which may have an association with the arms industry , then we would have to close virtually every American and Japanese software company on the island of Ireland with catastrophic consequences . #% The way in which the Community responds to Alzheimer 's disease will be a further test of this new commitment . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured then the standards laid down by the EU 's recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% A fear that we express : if these duties increase and they are to be the counterpart , taking the White Paper on employment growth and competitiveness , of reducing direct taxes on labour , how do we make the interconnection ? #% I say to the Chinese authorities : please preserve it , through the middle way approach , through supporting the autonomous region of Tibet , so that we can all continue to enjoy the heritage of this absolute jewel on the world stage . #% Very private information about people will be accessible to police and secret services without those people having any say or control . #% We are planting 25 , 000 hectares annually at the moment . #% Although these problems have now been resolved , there was not sufficient time for substantial negotiations to be undertaken . #% If not , we will put a false floor under rented land and active farmers will not be able to afford it . #% Indeed , the fact that 75 % of the complaints the Ombudsman 's office receives do not relate directly to European Union institutions and problems therein is , in my view , not necessarily a bad thing . #% Most people here will be aware of the increasing criticism , both nationally and internationally . #% Economic losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes have increased six-fold since the 1960s . #% I would like the services to correct that before the second reading . #% The Commission will shortly bring forward proposals on the next financial perspectives . #% We are ten years down the road . #% In my own country we have been reassured over and over again that the European Union is not being militarised , yet many reports which have gone through this Parliament in the five years I have been here clearly indicate that is the direction it is going in . #% I mention that particularly as someone from a relatively small state with a minority of all-Irish speakers , although the Irish language is not a minority language in Ireland and is the first official language of the country , with many people who have some words of Irish in general use . #% A one-size-fits-all policy in relation to environmental noise and the different transport sectors , not to mention differing circumstances in Member States , is not satisfactory legislation . #% Mr President , the terrorist attack in Madrid was an attack on all of us who believe in democracy . #% Mr President , like many EU harmonising proposals , this report has , at first glance , a certain plausible appeal . #% The group considers Amendments Nos 3 , 6 and 10 as very important . #% It is only realistic to expect that many problems will lie ahead - some will be minor , others more serious . #% I am happy to report that one of those initiatives , the establishment of a forum in Ireland on the future of Europe , has been adopted by the Irish Government . #% The Commission proposals were tough and will definitely have an impact upon the fishing communities involved , but they had to be tough because the state of the stocks is so poor . #% It is my first report in Parliament and I was glad to take on such a significant one . #% A negotiated settlement is still the only real long-term solution for the securing of a peace settlement in Chechnya . #% It is essential to point out at this stage that asylum seekers are covered by existing conventions aimed at protecting them against persecution . #% It is counterproductive and it has made a bad situation very much worse . #% I think the idea of the coastguard for Ireland is particularly important because we are an island . #% Such movements in border areas between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland must be stamped out and licenses withdrawn from those found to be involved in such practices . #% I have had the opportunity to go there and I know the people in that area are very much inclined to go forward and to be progressive . #% It is not the first time I have heard Commissioners come into this House and say they have no obligations in relation to nuclear power plants and that this is a matter for the Member States . #% I shall be contacting the Commissioner responsible with a view to obtaining further information on this matter . #% 
The Thorp plant has long been a nuclear white elephant for the British people , but the people of Ireland have been totally opposed to it for many years , and will continue to be opposed to it . #% Regulatory requirements are an integral part of the functioning of all services , and the need for such requirements increases with the amount of private-sector involvement . #% We must continue to work with the United Nations , whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times . #% We can best guarantee the fight against unemployment and encourage social cohesion in Europe through having an employment-rich economy and through having sustainable models of welfare . #% Therefore , the case for granting Objective 1 status to the midland region for the period 2000 to 2006 is both real and compelling and beyond reproach . #% In Ireland , suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds . #% Mr President , Commissioner , fluorinated gases are a grave threat to our environment . #% I was re-reading the hearings documents on the appointment of the Commission and I was very pleased to see how far the Commission has gone towards the objectives the Commissioner set out at that time . #% That to me is very regressive and needs to change . #% We will continue to urge early progress in introducing and implementing the further reforms necessary adequately to safeguard human rights which do not meet the standards we expect . #% In the name of those being driven from employment right across Europe , I call for a root and branch reassessment of our approach to cheap imports , so that the social economic consequences are properly considered . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports and for the great deal of work they put into preparing them . #% There is a clear demand for better computer resources in Irish schools . #% In the light of what is coming down the line , I would be interested to know whether the Commission proposes to take a more proactive approach to this . #% The strategy paper , which has been under consideration in the Council , has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found . #% It is frightening to hear President Prodi say that almost 80 % of respondents in a recent poll had no idea what was going on . #% The Commissioner may be aware that for the last two years the Irish Sea has been closed at spawning time to aid stock recovery . #% As other speakers have said , this is probably the most historic moment in Europe in the last 40 years . #% In particular it was found that the British decision to alter the manufacturing process which lowered sterilization standards for meat and bonemeal used in compound feeding stuffs for cattle allowed the emergence of the disease . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner . #% I want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system . #% The latest figures of serious CFP infringements are -- as we have heard -- those published by the Commission for 2003 . #% I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done in a very difficult area . #% At a time when there are many questions with regard to what Europe is doing and what it is about , the one area where we can claim to have success and where we have responded to the concerns of European citizens is in the area of public health . #% Our belief is that there is a clear political and a financial market expectation that Dublin II will deliver the Eurostatute , ERM II and the stability pact . #% Mrs Kauppi has referred to the concerns regarding the legal basis in her attached explanatory memorandum . #% It is good to be ambitious but the Liberal Group , while not necessarily against everything that is in the report , has not yet arrived at a level of reflection which allows us to be for everything in the report . #% But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland . #% The involvement of the United Nations in the conflict would be a welcome step forward . #% 2003 is a repeat of 2002 is a repeat of 2001 is a repeat of 2000 . #% The real issue at stake , which is totally lost in this report , is that nobody can communicate in confidence any more . #% We would view any change in this objective as a reason for voting against the report . #% We have been so busy reconstituting ourselves we have not yet had the capacity to do our homework and our research , so if the hearings bring to light issues of substance and public concern about which we as yet know nothing , we in this House would have a duty to Europe to act and we will act - certainly , my group will . #% In my own report I have said that the European Union must put in place a rigorous monitoring system of Community carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions at the earliest opportunity . #% I have been campaigning for the establishment of an EU Coastguard for a number of years . #% A total of 30 countries presently take part . #% Quite a lot of other matters have been raised . #% The consumers are bearing the brunt of that particular worry . #% Despite our diplomatic efforts so far , none of the conditions set by the sixth ASEM Ministerial meeting in Ireland last year , including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi as a minimum condition , has been fulfilled by the Burmese dictatorship . #% On tobacco I wish to support compromise Amendment No 20 , on the need to look at the automatic trigger . #% I also have a positive attitude towards this . #% I appeal to the men of violence to lay down their arms , to stop their murderous acts of violence in Ireland and elsewhere . #% Mr President , pursuant to Rules 127 and 108 of the Rules of Procedure of Parliament I wish to beg the indulgence of yourself and the House , if possible , to clarify remarks which I made this morning . #% Today we are voting on a voluntary scheme which certifies companies to label their products as environmentally friendly . #% The loosely-framed common position must be tightened up to discourage free-riders who do not take responsibility for their own waste . #% For example , a million citizens ' signatures can prompt the Commission to draft a proposal . #% There is a phrase often used in Northern Ireland politics : ` We all jump together ' . #% Mr President , the Liberal Group is deeply unhappy at the fact that we have been rail-roaded into an urgency . #% In all our peace initiatives , we must be constantly aware that , for the perpetrators of terror , peace is a threat that they will resist with all their might because peace will mean eventual conviction in the war crimes courts . #% I believe that will happen with this one as well , and quarry owners are not happy about that . #% I do not believe that this gives us a case to convert stocks of fish suitable for human consumption to animal and fish feed . #% The European Union must also implement the Financial Services Action Plan by the end of next year . #% The key element of this White Paper is the setting up of the food authority , as we discussed today . #% I have already talked about going native in regard both to Euratom and the UK inspectorate . #% We have had the Amsterdam Treaty which talks about creating an area of freedom , security and justice . #% However , each individual Member can request a filter on his or her machine to prevent these completely counter-productive e-mails from coming in . #% However , we can welcome the first sentence ` to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II ' . #% We would like this mid-term review to consider the impact of EU fishing on both the fish stocks and the artisanal fishing community . #% I firmly believe that European competitiveness will only improve when , in Ireland for example , businesses and consumers can make a payment from Dublin to Madrid as easily as from Dublin to Cork . #% I would like to ask him what monitoring system has the Commission in mind to ensure that there is a balance and an equal share-out of the funding across the regions ? #% There have been a number of recent reports - a very important study in The Lancet last year for example - which show that babies born within three kilometres of toxic landfill sites - and potentially all landfill sites - are more likely to suffer birth defects than babies born elsewhere . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her diligent work on the budget for 2011 . #% The basis of the proposal is that account is taken exclusively of scientific reports as regards management measures . #% Despite the importance of the work that these bodies were charged with , including , among other issues , equality proofing legislation , these bodies have ceased to be , given the drastic cuts in funding available to them . #% We know that a great deal of the EWL budget goes to coordination and research , but EWL does not offer financial aid to the associations that make it up . #% This initial six-month ban has been extended on a rolling basis ever since , despite a categorical Commission announcement in 2004 that there was no risk of TSE occurrence , let alone transmission , from fishmeal fed to ruminants and that the policy of zero tolerance of meat and bone spicules in animal feed should be lifted . #% 
By their very nature , secret services can not be controlled and therefore we , as Members of this Parliament , who claim to be concerned about human rights and basic civil liberties , should be questioning their very existence . #% This has now been excluded as a conservation area , with a serious reduction in the Irish Box which now is only to cover the southwest area . #% We were concerned last year - as were millions throughout the world - at the health and environmental consequences resulting from the testing in the South Pacific at Mururoa and most Members here will recall the public hearing held here in Parliament which dealt extensively with this issue of health and public safety . #% So we have chosen to abstain . #% I would point out to the British proponents of the original urgency motion that their own Labour Government was the most vociferous when the German Government recently mooted the introduction of a harmonised tax system in the European Union . #% The Commission has always undertaken the duties and responsibilities it has been given in an even-handed and fair manner . #% Many colleagues have already spoken with regard to the detail of what is contained in these reports and our aspirations for the future . #% Member States need to be realistic in recognising that the introduction of a common tax base is simply the thin edge of the wedge towards tax harmonisation . #% In recent times , as fleets continue to increase and resource abundance plummets , flags of convenience are increasingly used as a means of avoiding measures taken by countries or regional fisheries organisations to manage fisheries and conserve stocks . #% In fact , these two are the same priority . #% Energy conservation , rational planning and renewable energies are agreed to be the most important way forward other than the CO2 tax , about which , as I have said , no agreement has yet been reached . #% One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in Europe . #% In the light of this , I should like to ask Commissioner de Palacio to retract comments she made in December on the death of the Kyoto Treaty and request that she seek to revive that Treaty and redouble her efforts in getting Russia to join . #% The European Union , as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam , has greater powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer rights . #% There are lessons for us all to learn from the results of the Nice Treaty referendum . #% We in the EU must respond to this problem as a matter of urgency . #% The Dutch presidency must follow on with specific measures on improving education , more relevant training , Community-based employment initiatives and giving priority to youth unemployment and life-long learning . #% Far from giving more rights to the European Union institutions , the Charter limits the exercise of power by the EU institutions because they must explicitly respect human rights . #% For the past fifty years , RDAs have formed the basis of conventional nutritional wisdom . #% The question of the decommissioning of weapons in Northern Ireland is a very delicate and deeply sensitive question . #% Mr President , yesterday we heard the presidency of the European Union fudge on the issue of Iraq and Turkey . #% The confusion exists because this House adopted in July at first reading a conflicting proposal which both allowed and prohibited the patenting of the human genome . #% The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again . #% It is most important that we enthuse our peoples and - top of your agenda - enthuse the Irish people for the enlargement project which we all support . #% The existence of internment-without-trial camps in Guantanamo Bay has to unacceptable to anyone in a civilised society . #% It is time that we recognise and rebuild as institutions - Commission and Parliament - our common European vocation . #% in writing . - I heartily congratulate the voters of the Republic Of Ireland on convincingly rejecting the repackaged Constitution . #% So , for us it is not only important for the environment but economically we can develop our forests into something very important . #% Local communities have to live with that and , in some areas , even farming has been affected because the mining companies leave their mess behind , affecting not just the water supplies but also the land in general . #% On this occasion , I think we have got to move , and I want the Commission to give us an assurance that bureaucracy will not hold us back . #% We must be consistent in our approach to terrorism . #% I welcome both the European Ombudsman 's report and that of the rapporteur , Mr De Rossa , and congratulate them on their work . #% Mr President , there is something highly obnoxious about any trade in human body parts or tissue . #% I want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on putting together what I regard as a decent framework within which to move forward . #% To minimise the risk to these population centres of course . #% I am very glad to see that the Commission is on our side on this , but it needs to put much more pressure on the British Government to behave in a responsible manner . #% As we face a mid-term review of the Berlin agreement and the inevitable long term CAP reform , we must not allow the review to deviate from what was agreed in Berlin or to contemplate a move towards re-nationalisation of CAP in future reform . #% The renewal of the protocol is now more important than ever in terms of fishing opportunities , after the failure to reach agreement with Morocco . #% Justice delayed is justice denied . #% The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid . #% However , we must make this shift carefully and think of all the ramifications . #% Beyond the work we are doing today , there is no doubt that Equitable has left a sour taste for the losers and others who are watching events unfolding and it does nothing to help those who are trying to encourage citizens to invest in pensions . #% If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe , on the evidence to date , that this Commission is a reformist Commission . #% Doing so will have no adverse affects on the commendable work that is being done for small business but will send out a strong message that we must take a stand against unproductive , unwieldy and ill-conceived proposals that will be of no benefit to the European economy . #% I hope that the presidency will bring it to the attention of his colleague , the Irish minister for public enterprise , Mary O'Rourke , and to try to force her to take the needs of disabled people into account in all EU funds expenditure . #% Would he also accept - and I agree with his point about the strategic importance of Pakistan in the region , especially at this critical time - that failed states , abuse of human rights and abuse of democracy are the very things that feed terrorism ? #% On a personal note I would point out that these last two issues are fundamental to my own country , Ireland . #% Organized crime is emerging as one of the major problems in many countries . #% Certainly I will ensure that the concerns he expressed are taken into account so far as I can . #% We in Parliament have exercised a certain amount of power already with regard to this piece of legislation , and it would be a pity if we did not continue to exercise this power wisely . #% Moreover , women of all ages often care for young and elderly dependents . #% As someone who was in the last Parliament I know how much thankless time and effort they have put in since BSE first began in a very difficult area to try and find a resolution and a way forward to help everyone in a very sensible way . #% Economic growth , in the initial stages , depends more on developing countries ' internal markets than access to markets elsewhere . #% The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK . #% I particularly welcome the decision to create a Peace-Building Commission as well as the inclusion of the concept of human security in the official UN framework . #% There is no need to reopen the argument concerning the membership of the Commission . #% You have also referred at length to energy . #% Our vote will allow this House to place the deeply sensitive issue of the peace process in Northern Ireland above our day-to-day political concerns . #% However , we will not have a serious effect on the level of injury until people realise that every person matters and that the loss or disablement of even one person is a great loss to us all . #% What strikes me about me about the Commission 's statement is that in a zone as large as the EMU , labour costs are generally considered as the main potential source of inflation . #% When can we in Parliament expect to receive its draft proposals for a legislative framework ? #% Finally , I would like to add my voice to those who plea that we do something realistic about energy savings in Parliament buildings and in EU buildings in general . #% As to that future , I have no doubt that the industry must be involved in the decision-making process . #% The central aspect to the implementation of new employment must be a need to guarantee a fair distribution of job opportunities throughout each Member State through the process of regionalisation and decentralisation . #% I hope that the US and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of greenhouse gases . #% Finally , the issue of low-level presence will always be with us , and , while speedy functioning of the authorisation system will improve the situation , we still need a technical solution . #% 
Of course , we must pay due attention to people who are at present within the formal education system , and improving the Erasmus and the Escola programmes and other similar programmes is vitally important . #% It has now been conclusively proven scientifically and yet we here in the European Union are not capable nor even have the courage ... #% At the same time , we have a promise on page 12 that measures to complete the internal market , by eliminating barriers to the provision and take-up of services by business and consumers , will proceed next year . #% Commissioner , it is within your and the Council 's powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way . #% There is no need to confuse and mislead the consumers of Europe on a compulsory basis , because the voluntary labelling system which will be driven by competition , pride in product and consumer demand will add anything that a compulsory category label might otherwise require . #% I am very concerned about the threat to combined heat and power in the gas directive . #% This subject is , of course , closely linked with maintaining the strictest controls to ensure protection of our seas from environmental damage by shipping . #% I commend the rapporteur , Mr Whitehead , and all involved in producing this excellent report . #% To date we do not have level of funding either from the EU or from the Member States . #% Given these experiences , we should not be alarmed at the prospect of taking similar decisions in other areas rather than face paralysis and stagnation at the hands of eurosceptic Member States . #% The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure , making water and airborne infectious disease rampant . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well-chosen words here this evening . #% In conclusion , it is my firm belief that if the Union wishes to remain relevant , then modernisation of its laws and policies must always be voted in favour of . #% Our policy on development aid focuses on good governance and respect for human rights and it certainly does not seem to be the case here . #% I make this appeal for the record : even though this is only an opinion , Ecofin might show some courtesy to Parliament by meeting with us so that we can register with them too our concern that we should be properly consulted . #% Whilst we all await with great uncertainty and excitement the outcome of the Convention , it plays no role whatsoever in forming the basis of our work today . #% In relation to the levy to be deducted from processors , could the Commission say whether , if a country -- and I am speaking of Ireland -- grows beet in 2006 , the company has to contribute to the restructuring levy this year , should it intend to stop production in 2007 ? #% Some of my colleagues have already touched on the points . #% For this reason , the creation of a uniform legal basis for controlling and preventing the spread of BSE and scrapie is paramount and there is still , as other speakers have suggested , a lack of consistency in relation to the application of the regulations within individual Member States . #% We should be doing our best to get more finances to deal with this problem . #% One just has to look , for example , at the negotiations over cod and other TACs during the December meeting to see that there is no political will there . #% Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing . #% I said earlier in response to another debate in the House on the common foreign and security policy area that I believe that we need to do much more as a region in a coordinated way to tackle this problem . #% My own Member State solemnly declared last year at the United Nations General Assembly that it would reach the 0.7 % of GDP by the year 2010 . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I support what Mr Van Orden said . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on this report , which adds clarity and weight to the debate . #% Would it be possible to take a split vote on recital E ? #% The same applies to Irish cattle . #% The EU must step in to fully cover the loss of this income while making it clear that we will recover that money from Israel by freezing all money due to Israel from the EU to the same value , until it stops this further breach of international law . #% I ask you to use your discretion in interpreting that aspect and to give us clear guidance on what latitude you will allow us . #% Complex or not , the petitioners have a right to know why European Union rules for the regulation of Lloyd 's were not properly implemented . #% There is not . #% For many years , social partners have been viewing social funding , human resources and even goodwill as a cake for which they , like hungry children , have felt compelled to compete . #% But I would have liked to have seen the Council move a lot closer to Parliament 's figure of EUR 2,500 million . #% - I welcome the adoption of this report on the basis that it ensures the right to a higher level of public health protection and could potentially pave the way for the eventual eradication of tobacco addiction within the EU in the long term . #% The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief . #% Many pharmaceutical companies have been spending up to 25 % of the research budget in defending their products . #% As many speakers have said , conventional arms kill more that half a million people a year , that is one person every minute . #% The President-in-Office has admitted there will be job losses and also that we can put off this decision until such time as there is harmonisation of taxation - particularly excise duty . #% We may not like what is underneath but we can not fail our children . #% While some sort of devolution may in some cases be acceptable or desirable , it must be remembered that fish swim around so management of fisheries must be achieved at an appropriate level . #% Many young people from rural areas some 20 , 30 or 40 years ago , at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about , would naturally have gone on to become young farmers . #% I have a number of points to make in the brief time available . #% We need to have some latitude at the level of individual installations to temporarily opt out of the scheme for the pilot phase only . #% It is a recipe for defeat for the outcome of the IGC , but it is also a recipe for the defeat of Europe . #% It is important that we make that distinction . #% Mr President , the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999 has certainly ensured that greater attention is given to the implementation of a common employment policy . #% We need to look at this . #% As the Jacobites said after the Battle of the Boyne , `` Change kings and we will fight you over again '' , and I believe we will win the next time . #% Now we have to start biting some bullets ; we have to start focusing on the issues . #% There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe . #% In fact , it is in that context , in a global market , that the euro perhaps offers its greatest potential to Europe for the future and to the single market in particular . #% He said that the issue of a direct tax was on the table . #% The working time directive as proposed by the Council could result in higher costs for companies . #% We , more than most nations , have benefited from the generosity of spirit and kindness of other nations in our history , most notably Britain , Australia and the United States of America . #% They can not understand why Europe is not more present in the United Nations . #% Parliament essentially exercises its competences in the policy domain at three levels : determination of political priorities -- which means codecision at policy-setting level , monitoring implementation , and budgetary powers . #% These reports are well drafted . #% The same kind of legislation could be introduced in Europe with regard to corruption so that anybody in Europe involved in corruption or bribing officials in Africa or any other Third World country could and should be charged under legislation in their home country . #% How far can hazard analysis and critical control points -- HACCP -- be implemented in primary production on farms ? #% I would say to the Council and I would say to the presidency this morning : if you want to ensure that those who commit violations of humanitarian law are brought to justice ; if you want to send a clear message ; if you want to prevent more victims in the future , you should use your presidency to start a campaign at least among EU Member States . #% For example , some gears have a higher by-catch than others or inflict more severe damage on the sea bottom . #% This is the worst we have heard of to date but we understand there are amputations taking place in Nigeria for relatively minor offences . #% Mr President , the burden of funding the enlargement of the Union to the east should be shared by the existing Member States in a just and equitable manner . #% My colleagues from Spain and Portugal have also referred to this . #% These reservations aside , I am very glad to be able to say that on this occasion also I recommend a very positive assessment of the Maltese application . #% 
It is no coincidence that the euro has been fully accepted in my own country , Ireland . #% We can not overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue . #% We have great expectations of this presidency and we will be keeping a very steady eye on what is happening and on progress . #% We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business . #% Mr President , in many ways we have become so desensitised to the violence that takes place around the world that what happened in Jenin , what has happened with the suicide bombers in Israel , has seemed to pass us by completely . #% I wish to thank him and his colleagues for a very effective and efficient EU presidency . #% The guidelines underline the vital role of urban areas in the European economy . #% Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving . #% We need mutual respect between all the institutions of the European Union , and an understanding that power does not rest within one institution alone and that we are interdependent on each other . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , this debate comes at a very timely juncture for tourism , the air travel industry and consumer protection . #% In relation to Natura 2000 , the Teesmouth and Cleveland coasts have been classified as special protection areas under that programme . #% The timing of the present communication gives it a special significance in that it represents a bridge to the Green Paper to be published on the review of the common fisheries policy . #% Our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in Europe . #% To do otherwise would be to give the power of veto to any eurosceptic Member State . #% It is going to be very difficult to look after the animals if the rest period is on the vehicle . #% It is my belief that in many parts of the developing world impunity is the single biggest contributing factor to continued human rights abuses , because people believe that they will not be punished or held to account for the horrific actions they either sanction or take themselves . #% This is utterly unacceptable . #% Both sides must show their commitment to peace by acting with maximum restraint , as called for by the EU Presidency in its recent declaration . #% The UN estimates that five to six thousand children die unnecessarily each month due to sanctions , even after the UN food for oil programme . #% So a number of factors had to be taken into account in this allocation . #% It has opted for the airport-based approach along the lines of ICAO Resolution A337 . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today . #% I am thinking primarily of the use of DDT against malaria because , despite the best efforts of scientists and their redoubled efforts to find an effective vaccine , this is still many years away . #% With the considerable help of your office and of Parliament we have had some significant successes in returning these children to their parents . #% That is a responsibility for the Council . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should just like to bring to the attention of the House a technical amendment that we should make pursuant to Rule 155 . #% I support this resolution and the proposal for the family to be given full funding for any legal fees it may incur if it goes to trial . #% Mr President , I wish to speak briefly on another point of order in relation to the Minutes . #% Mr President , I am sorry to hear that the Commissioner is ill this evening . #% The prospect of deepening cooperation in the field of immigration and asylum policy is to be applauded . #% Mr President , we must say to Mr Santer that it is encouraging to see that he is proposing certain reforms . #% We have to recognise that before we begin . #% I recently visited a number of orchard owners in Northern Ireland who have suffered from the declining bee population and indeed voiced their concern over it . #% The biggest threat to Ireland at the moment is wage inflation fuelled by 75,000 job vacancies . #% This is not in any individual country ; it is everywhere . #% I would call on this House to ensure that we do not put in place any hindrances to the development of this industry , which is a vital sector for the economy and employment creation . #% We still have enormous problems of social exclusion , especially in deprived urban and rural communities , and , indeed , underdevelopment . #% Is it not absolutely amazing that you see the manic determination to complete the single market with regard to duty free and nothing being done here ? #% We do need to especially bear that in mind at this moment . #% However concerns raised by industry regarding the possibility that public expectations may be raised prematurely with regard to some products and commercial sensitivity of information are also valid . #% All for the sake of ` clarification ' . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the proposed microfinance facility . #% If the Member puts down a question in relation to this particular article I will attempt to answer it . #% There must be a European-wide political agreement concerning the framework decision on the identification , seizure and confiscation of products of crime . #% I wish them continued success for the next couple of weeks and that Cardiff will be like the finishing of the Grand National , as was said by Mr Titley . #% Let us encourage women . #% I am strongly of the view that all reports by committees of this House , whatever their status , should at least be available to Members of this House before they are available to those outside . #% I am not that keen to get into this issue , but I simply want to say that the legal and justice provisions in the Republic of Ireland are already under way . #% They have failed to do so up to now . #% The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably . #% We had a worse situation in the past , when mismanagement of large companies resulted in the fact that , in the clearance of accounts procedures , major corrections were being made against the Member States which were not passed on to the food processors and the people who were involved in the abuses in the first place . #% In this situation and with this directive , we have struck a balance . #% We govern , after all , by consent . #% War is a failure of politics . #% The issue regarding the Baltic concerns the adoption of a closed season for salmon . #% British Aerospace is responsible for arming the Indonesians ... #% The IGC has the opportunity to enhance efficiency and effectiveness and to deepen the democratic character of the European Union . #% Following on from what he has said , Parliament has been told by the Commission that it can not undertake any action because the Council has made a decision and has refused to alter that decision in any way . #% I would also urge that this declaration be accepted as a protocol to the next Treaty changes in 2004 . #% Since 11 September this has become even more important . #% We know that air travel is safe but there is nonetheless a small risk for some passengers that they may develop blood clots . #% If the impact is found to be negative , we want a renegotiation of the agreement to eliminate those fishing activities which cause the problems . #% However , Africa has more than economic problems : it has political and human rights problems . #% We should have the same rights as US citizens if there is any agreement , that is fundamental . #% The situation in agriculture is similar . #% The concentration of infrastructural development in cities must not be at the expense of other areas . #% 
The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion . #% Terrorist attacks are an attack on the most fundamental human right - the right to life . #% This was a major issue of sensitivity during the Irish referendum campaign on the Lisbon Treaty . #% Security is important in motherhood but financial security is not the whole story . #% The Community average income of sheep and goat producers is generally amongst the lowest of all sectors , especially in northern Europe where lambs are reared in meat production systems . #% However , we need to take a suitable light-touch approach to regulation in order to provide incentives that will encourage investment in funds based in the EU rather than continue to drive them offshore . #% In December 1999 , DG SANCO proposed to allow the veterinary use of substances without MRLs in horses , provided records of treatment are kept and horses do not enter into the food chain before six months after use . #% The single market has brought many benefits to our citizens , but it has also provided the criminals with just that - a single market for their activities . #% Action must be taken against the continued practice of female genital mutilation . #% We had another committee which gave a different point of view . #% Moreover , unleaded petrol and diesel sold after 1 January 2000 will also have to comply with the new environmental specifications . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have done over the last six months . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Tillich for his report and congratulate him on trying so hard to represent almost everybody 's point of view . #% This is a man who has been informing the rest of the world of the suffering , injustice and tragedy that continues there . #% It is well known - indeed Germany informed the International Conference - that 19 cases of thefts involving nuclear materials have been discovered over the last two years . #% I call on the Vietnamese authorities to release all political and religious prisoners and I am asking the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the elections which will take place in July are free and fair . #% Madam President , I should also like to thank Mrs Fontaine for a very excellent report and also my colleague Mrs Berger who took on board several amendments regarding the architects . #% Our decisions were taken here unanimously : support for the International Fund for Ireland , support for the peace and reconciliation programme and , of course , Interreg . #% I have to admit that extending that to the applicant countries seems to me , in view of the length of time we have spent getting to where we are in the present Union , to be a daunting task , but I am convinced that the Commission is working towards it . #% I might conclude by saying that I would have preferred it if the British entered EMU at the first opportunity . #% You have said that you can see advantages and disadvantages in the convention method and I am aware that many in the Council would share that view . #% But according to the Commission there can be no question of them reaping the benefits . #% I want a single market in services , but I will not accept the ` country of origin ' principle , which will give us a lower level of social services and will undermine the faith that millions of people outside Europe place in us to lead the way in creating a better world . #% The recent publication of the Santer package of proposals has clearly shown that the existing Member States will have to take difficult decisions concerning the size of the European budget and the future operation both of the Structural Funds and of the common agricultural policy in order to prepare for enlargement . #% Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very , very shoddy grounds ? #% What has happened here today has played right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry , which will now have more customers because more people are going to fall ill . #% I would have some dispute with you with regard to thermo-nuclear fusion being an alternative energy source , because it already exists . #% The Community Fifth Environmental Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution . #% Yet , Mr Blair , you are prepared to sacrifice Europe 's budget agreement and the European project to continue being the populist servant of Mr Murdoch and his newspapers . #% However , many of Malta 's administrative , legal and fiscal structures have already been aligned to European Union standards . #% Who will finance the Adaptation Fund ? #% I do not see the citizens of Europe out on the streets demanding the right to vote for European political parties , but I do find them demonstrably rejecting an ever-increasingly centralised Europe such as in France and Holland last year . #% Stability is needed , and suggestions that a new reform is necessary will only bring about more uncertainty . #% This is , however , a criminal offence , and I would like to see considerably more cooperation between the police forces in all our countries . #% One of the things we should try and do over the next five years is to forge a closer partnership between national and regional parliaments and the European level . #% First of all , there must be a restatement of commitment and idealism in respect of the Lisbon Agenda , establishing the genuine goals and targets of having , by 2010 , the most dynamic economy in the world and creating the investment , research and development that we will need to create new jobs and new opportunities . #% When we talk about issues of concern , it is a valid question that you might take up . #% CAP should be reformed to pay farmers for the delivery of public goods , such as an attractive countryside rich in biodiversity . #% I would like to highlight what I believe are some of the key elements in the reform of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries . #% In view of the recent coverage of , for example , charges for wheelchairs at Dublin Airport by Ryanair , it is important that the Commission comes forward with the promised regulation on the contract between passengers and airlines , particularly for passengers with disabilities . #% Mr President , I commend the rapporteur , Mr Liese , for his conscientious work on this very sensitive and technical subject . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to say that I very much appreciate the comprehensive statement made in the debate this morning by Commissioner Patten on the many complex issues which remain to be contended with in this very difficult area . #% And of course in the not-so-distant past there was Chernobyl , the memory of which still haunts us . #% That means , as policymakers and institutions , we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain . #% We have to work for them , using this Constitution as the basis for our work . #% The US Government has been a very strong supporter of its industry , especially since 11 September , and continues to be so . #% Social Security and Pensions , #% Finally , I would urge the three Member States which have not yet ratified the EUROPOL convention to do so without delay . #% Commissioner , is it not a fact that the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda are far from being attained , and that we are still lagging behind in measures necessary for the coordination and progress of SMEs under those objectives of the Lisbon Agenda that we initially laid down ? #% However , it will , of course , always remain the responsibility of each individual judicial authority to assess any evidence , forensic or not , in accordance with its own national law . #% And there is one person who has played an integral part in all this , Senator George Mitchell , whose contribution to the peace process is immeasurable . #% The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve , according to one of its former economists , shows that typically , when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates , when interest rates increase , prices begin to decline roughly 18 months to 2 years later . #% If I may say so , the Irish cinema is 100 years old this year and our recent experience has been very beneficial . #% Firstly , it is essential to the success of any programme that the people who provide the training - the experts , whether they be educational or vocational - should be included in the decision-making on the types of programmes to be involved . #% The BSE crisis of recent years must never again threaten European consumers , farmers and the beef industry . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like firstly to say that we welcome the Secchi report and we congratulate the rapporteur . #% I regret it if there are people in Northern Ireland who have a feeling that one community has benefited more than the other or that the transparency that should be there is not there . #% At the informal Glasgow Council , children from across the European Union fifteen Member States were asked to design and present to ministers their ideal city of the future . #% There are 18 million long-term unemployed in Europe at the moment . #% Mr President , I am in favour of research . #% This is something that the Green Group stated a long time ago in this Parliament and we have now been vindicated . #% Ever since the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year , the European Parliament has power of codecision in the whole area of transport policy matters . #% We , as Members of the European Parliament , should be demanding that people ' s freedoms and the right to privacy , as enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention and Article 6 of the EU Treaty , are protected and that people are not forced to live under permanent control where the possibility exists that every communication they make will be accessible to unknown forces . #% The ultimate goal has to be sustainable fisheries through regional management , by opening up the governance of the common fisheries policy and helping to overcome mistrust and scepticism . #% Indeed , the Presidency document on urban exchange produced a very good exchange of experience on looking at a comprehensive approach to regeneration , to tackle problems faced by disadvantaged people concentrated in particular areas , to look at town centre management and to address urban quality issues . #% What is it about the institutions of Europe - about the European Parliament , about the European Union collectively - that makes us unable to respond to the crises in the world as our people , our voters , our citizens would want us to do ? #% 
I am referring to the controversial hushkits legislation , an example of how not to do something . #% Where I come from in Northern Ireland fishermen have already suffered severe setbacks and quotas and have cooperated in six-week closures during the spawning season , for the last three to four years . #% I would call upon the Council to adopt them this week . #% Commissioner , you have done it again : having given the Commission the ` two fingers ' when you were an Irish minister , you have now outraged the Swedish population with a similar gesture towards their social partnership model as well as the European Parliament today . #% These are the values which have brought peace , prosperity and freedom to our continent , and it is only right and fitting that we should seek to promote these benefits further afield . #% We are the body with the political competence to take into account the substantial and professional work of the Court of Auditors . #% These costs -- or more correctly these potential savings -- must be taken into account when considering the cost of a ban on cadmium batteries . #% . Common fisheries policy rules must be implemented effectively and in a uniform way . #% I regret the fact that the Commission has not to date made the gesture of withdrawing its letter of formal notice to the Danish Government . #% He said : ' The people , the areas , the community groups at the heart of the problem must be at the heart of the solution . ' #% The situation in Germany is particularly difficult due to sheer numbers ; 2 476 redundancies are concentrated in the same area , around the same industry . #% The way Question Time is run is not acceptable . #% My understanding is that the study in the Lancet magazine referring to dangers for pregnant women living near landfill sites refers to sites where hazardous and toxic waste - not normal waste - is being dumped . #% Those of us who are not scientists must rely on the judgment and evaluation of professionally qualified people . #% We should get our priorities right . #% No Khmer Rouge leaders has ever been tried and only two are in detention , one being the person who ran a notorious torture centre in Phnom Penh from which only seven out of more than fourteen thousand inmates emerged alive . #% They want to see positive developments and I am suggesting tonight that there is a number of positive things that we can do within this Parliament . #% But still , contrary to research , the old spurious arguments are trotted out ; ` it could be evaded , it would be a burden on consumers ' . #% in writing . - I support this Report which modifies the European Regional Development Fund in order to permit and facilitate energy efficiency and renewable energies interventions in the housing sector in all Member States . #% So I welcome this adoption of an ICAO balanced approach to air traffic noise reduction as it amounts to a fundamental system change for the European Union . #% I was informed yesterday by the questions office of this House that my question relating to the Middle East would not be taken by the Council today because the matter I was raising , the Association Agreement between Europe and Israel , would be dealt with by the Council in debate yesterday . #% We want to see the expansion of 24-hour hotlines and electronic watchtowers . #% But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues : first of all , the fact that there are some diverse standards ; secondly , the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration . #% Mr President , today 's debate is quite timely as industrial leaders in different parts of the world are pressurizing governments into dropping any plans for sanctions against Burma . #% I believe , however , that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion . #% in writing . - I welcome the adoption of this report in my capacity as the Chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland . #% In my view the draft Treaty , which is to be presented to the December summit in Dublin , must give priority to issues of widespread concern , such as employment policy and the fight against crime . #% They were told how the common agricultural policy was going to operate for a seven year period until 2006 and they were basing their commercial decisions on this framework as laid down in the Berlin Agreement . #% Under existing EU Treaties such tax changes require the unanimous support of all EU Governments . #% IRA terrorists Monaghan , Connolly and McCauley were duly convicted of training FARC guerrillas in Colombia . #% Please do not send us down that road again . #% Verification of such claims is also crucial if consumers are actually to have confidence in this . #% In the first year , 2005 , the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated in those 21 countries . #% History tells us that when human institutions become the giver of rights , rights become gifts . #% I am quite upset at the way the oral amendment was bounced . #% We must fully implement the Action for Growth initiative , which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks . #% On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today : to vote in favour , to vote against or to abstain . #% There is unequivocal scientific evidence about the damage which has been done to many communities as the ozone layer is being depleted . #% However , we have not overlooked the weaknesses in the system and our motion for a resolution proposes changes and improvements both in planning and administration . #% in writing . - I support the conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the European Community . #% Time is of the essence in this regard , as the more we delay the more lives are lost . #% Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war . #% Mr President , I should like to support what the other speakers have said . #% Is it not rather odd that it takes until the end of the HELIOS programme before an assessment is made ? #% Therefore , it is important to break new ground , to offer fishermen the hope of greater participation than they had in the past . #% We can not criticise governments and , at the same time , sell weapons to them when they persecute their own people and territories that they have illegally occupied . #% Is this a wise move ? #% However , I can not emphasize enough , without reiterating all that has been said by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and other speakers , that the consequences of the worldwide increase in temperatures include the raising of sea level , climatic changes and an increased incidence of skin cancer . #% The intimidation , arbitrary arrests and disappearances - which is probably another way of saying summary executions - of opponents , particularly in recent months , is quite unacceptable . #% I do not snigger at any such comments . #% I think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the European Parliament representing people in every Member State . #% With regard to aggregate MRLs , if , for example , there are two or three different pesticides , but they are all below the MRLs , the combination should say that they should not be on the market . #% Finally , I would like to point out that , in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water , the burden of disease in the EU is increasing . #% There will probably be no winners , but there will certainly be losers . #% The Commission has proposed a lifting of this ban in Northern Ireland . #% For the first time the provisional movement has been shaken to the core by the depth of reaction from within its own community . #% It is important for mobile professionals to realise that they must be proficient in the language of their host country since the ability to communicate is a prerequisite for practising . #% Let us listen to sound scientific advice and trust in our own food safety system , which I believe is second to none . #% He will see the impact of that disappointment and anger in the days to come . #% With regard to the services directive and the financial perspectives , Parliament is willing to act as a political body to ensure that it can deliver on behalf of the European citizens , in cooperation with the other institutions . #% Nonetheless , I should like to ask you what measures Parliament 's security services have taken to detect similar bugging and spying devices within the newly-built Parliament offices . #% I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing . #% Bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and , of course , the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , the spiralling level of violence in the Middle East blinds us to the fact that it was not so very long ago that , instead of the current feelings of despair , there was optimism and hope that a permanent peace could be achieved . #% We need time to reflect , to analyse the outcome , to learn from it , to respond to the legitimate fears and concerns and , above all , to try and understand why 65 % of the electorate stayed at home . #% It would appear as if they are lining up a deal and will be using agricultural standards as a currency to buy a deal with Mercosur countries . #% 
I welcome the proposal for four representatives on the board to be appointed by Parliament . #% Our traditional exports are gradually being reopened for beef for most Member States . #% It is also important that the Indonesian Government should replace its Kopassus units because they are seen daily as a threat to the Papuan people . #% It is quite disgraceful that the European Union itself has not made its views known on this matter at this critical juncture for Mrs Radia Nasrawi . #% I will give the rest of my time to silence , as indeed did my colleague beside me . #% Agriculture is the single rural affairs policy for which the Community has total responsibility . #% What representation did the Commissioner receive from the United Kingdom Government about this dire emergency ? #% The uncoordinated and therefore ineffective response of the EU to the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo was a serious embarrassment . #% I hope that the British Government gives the necessary clarification in this case . #% The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for . #% Every year I hear of one , two or even sometimes three cases where people experience problems in relation to the repatriation of remains . #% I would add , though perhaps not with 100 % conviction , that the meeting that is taking place today between Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the heads of the political groups should not have been confined to the heads of the political groups . #% It is the responsibility of governments to address that . #% They would also lead to a serious deterioration in safety standards , a matter which we must all be very concerned about . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the trade union organisations , the Commission and , indeed , the ambassador for their help with my research . #% In relation to the latter part of the honourable Member 's question , if he puts down a separate question I will try to deal with it . #% Unemployment figures are as close as you will get to full employment in today 's Union . #% I want to make it quite clear that the position of the Liberal Group is that we shall vote for the joint resolution and we shall not vote for any amendments . #% No European money whatsoever has been involved in the project . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Stauner , my colleague and good friend , for her report . #% We have all involved ourselves in this debate and something worthwhile will come from it . #% We have spoken about it many times in Parliament : in 1997 the Council joint action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children paved the way for Member States to review the relevant criminal law so as to ensure the criminalisation of certain behaviours and to encourage judicial cooperation . #% Since 1993 the free movement of goods , capital and persons has yielded enormous economic and social gains . #% That will not always be possible , but let us have a broader and balanced debate and restore choice for women . #% I take a dim view of the attempt by Mr Watson , the leader of the Liberal Group , to demean the motives of myself and my colleagues in travelling to Baghdad this weekend to try to persuade whatever authorities we have the opportunity to meet there to cooperate actively with the inspectors and , indeed , to see first-hand the impact which sanctions are having , particularly on the children of Iraq . #% So much for the IRA 's supposed disciplinary action : it is a farce . #% If we take the example of the Community 's approach to food safety legislation , whereby legislation is based on the principle that consumers have the right to know what they are consuming , then the same principle must apply to tobacco products : smokers should have the right to know exactly what they are smoking and what the effects are . #% This was always going to be difficult to achieve but the Greek Government approached this political issue at all times with determination and with true sensitivity to all the parties involved . #% I would therefore encourage Israel , whatever the international pressures , to be resolute and constant in this regard . #% The present difficulties experienced by farmers are serious . #% I also wish to join in the thanks to the Commissioner for his work in the area of disability and in particular to welcome his commitment to involve the NGOs in the area , especially the European Disability Forum . #% Wealth , growth , enterprise and development need not , and do not , consume the environments of mature societies . #% Originally the plan was for the vessels to pass through Irish waters but at the moment it seems that is not the case . #% We need patents in order to protect our own companies and investments so that they can be effective global players in this fast-changing and rapidly developing software-development market . #% I believe it is up to the Maltese themselves to decide on whether or not they want to join . #% However , that social policy contributes to the quality of the labour market and the formation of social capital . #% The Parliament 's draft statute ( rapporteur : Rothley ) , has been approved by resolutions of the European Parliament and President Cox was given a mandate by the Council of Presidents in June to undertake exploratory contacts with the Member State Governments and to report back to the Conference of Presidents in the context of the opinion on the Rothley report . #% The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security . #% Purists could never accuse it of being franglais , not that I would ever dare to offer such an insult to the members of the AcadÃ©mie . #% The Irish Sea must not be used as a soft option for the disposal of radioactive nuclear materials by BNFL . #% The policy was given a bad name in the past when most of the funds were channelled to the agricultural industry through the processors and exporters . #% Our dependency on oil is proving too costly in every respect . #% So I welcome the proposals put forward by Mr Chanterie to try to bring some regulation and flexibility into that sector . #% However , on this issue we would find very little to differ on , and I welcome his comments here this evening . #% I reiterate the point that we can not compromise in any respect the safety of our EU citizens . #% Major European companies have to be accountable in how they operate in other parts of the world . #% Like most RNA viruses , it reproduces sloppily , its genes readily fall apart , and it can absorb different genetic material which recombines in a process called reassortment . #% They announced these measures to increase the availability of products . #% The distinction is there for one simple reason and it has served its purpose well down the years . #% Here I am referring especially to the increases allowed in intervention quantities for 1996/97 . #% author . - Madam President , I , too , want to commend to Members the excellent work that has been carried out by our rapporteurs for the goods package , Mr Brie , Ms Schaldemose and Mr Stubb , who , I think , are all legislative virgins . #% We have also been the losers of important projects and significant job numbers . #% What does not have a place in energy and the environment is nuclear power because it is not sustainable . #% It is necessary to bear in mind the sensitivities of the victims of terror and their families during the process and in its conclusion . #% If Ireland is to continue providing fish to the rest of the EU and still have the means to provide for their families this is not acceptable . #% Those who say that it is not must not be listened to . #% It is not easy but it is essential and we are well placed because we have , to a limited extent , managed that . #% This should be rethought in the interests of the overall talks , because I believe agriculture will always be a problem . #% In an ideal world I would expect that citizens would be protected from any risk of environmental damage -- and thankfully we are making progress in terms of some real preventative measures . #% Mr President , firstly my congratulations to Mr Goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation . #% I appreciate his point that under the 1995 fisheries legislation provisions this is taken into consideration , but does he support the provision of funding commensurate with the area to be surveyed by the Irish authorities ? #% Unless the proposals are extensively amended many marginalized Irish farms will come under pressure and some may not survive . #% Mr President , I should like your guidance . #% It is not just about economic returns . #% The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities . #% Animals should always be slaughtered close to the place where they were reared . #% 
I want to acknowledge , Mr Spring , your own personal efforts in trying to establish reconciliation in Northern Ireland , often in very difficult circumstances . #% Mr President , could I say directly to Commissioner Nielson that I wrote to you on 18 August expressing my concern about the life and the plight of Father Brendan Forde , the Irish priest whose life is currently under threat in the complex political circumstances that pertain in Colombia . #% There will , however , always be a small number of people in any country who are prepared to abuse a system . #% Secondly , in relation to what has happened in Ireland this weekend , it is only proper that we should have a debate on this . #% I voted for the joint resolution although there has not yet been ratification of the Nice Treaty in Ireland . #% The provision of such information would greatly enhance Parliament ' s contribution to the development of a more effective and cohesive EU foreign policy , which is long overdue . #% Furthermore , in its statement the Presidency expresses ` concern ' about reports of manipulation - very mild indeed - and you ask the Election Commission to follow up such complaints . #% The current proposal , which I support , will ensure continuity while negotiations for a new protocol are carried out in the course of this year . #% Following on from what the Minister has already said , I would like to put two propositions to her . #% The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake . #% Many of these countries continue to imprison persons who are referred to as ` cyber dissidents ' and we call for their immediate release . #% At a time when the average EU citizen is getting heavier and up to 27 % of European men , 32 % of European women and a staggering one-quarter of Europe 's children are now obese , I warmly welcome the European Union 's initiative in tackling obesity through a very important first step : the addressing of nutrition and health claims on food . #% The Court notes that the Single Payment Scheme has side effects , such as the allocation of entitlements to landowners who never exercised previous agricultural activity , leading to a substantial redistribution of EU aid away from farmers to landlords . #% Mr President , I have been watching this whole business of Structural Funds and additionality for many years , and there are a number of things that we can learn from the past . #% With such a high uptake , it is clear that more European red tape on top of the current legislation is unnecessary in the UK . #% It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible , but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro . #% UN forces led by the EU must ensure that United Nations Resolution 1701 is enforced and that , through cooperation with Lebanese troops and political leaders , Hizbollah can be disarmed . #% While we acknowledge the need to continue to concentrate our resources on the poorest and declining areas , some of which are in my own region Merseyside , we still have to have solidarity as a two-way process . #% Enlargement , being the main subject on the agenda , has been very much at the heart of the referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty in my country . #% Only incineration with high standards of energy efficiency will be defined as recovery . #% Of course I have voted against it . #% Former Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Mr Finucane 's murder and identified the basic requirements for a public enquiry . #% She has begun to take action and I appreciate that very much . #% Take Zimbabwe , for example , which Mr DeÃ has already referred to . #% National laws and policies should be improved through the development of comprehensive national action plans to prevent , protect and prosecute . #% These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations . #% I support Turkey 's membership of the EU , but only on the basis that they fulfil the Copenhagen criteria . #% As a step in the right direction the Greens support the idea of penalties for those countries which are not observing their legally binding commitments to reduce fleets . #% This must be made clear at the ESA ministerial meeting . #% We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully . #% Mr President , ideally GMOs should not be released into the environment . #% The subject of eugenic practices is one such subject which , through the adoption of Amendment 15 , was included in this resolution . #% Regardless of the rights or wrongs of these two hardline positions , we do not need a report calling on the European Union to pursue a preventive policy against any form of violent religious fundamentalism . #% It is a pity that Parliament could not reciprocate with an equivalent level of attendance . #% Finally , I would like to ask the Commission to look at ensuring that these single points of delivery , these one-stop-shops that are so vital to delivering , monitoring and supervising the kind of services we want . #% We reject this because any abuse of children is a criminal offence . #% The slow and ineffective handling of the Dell application risks a return of much of the allocation to Brussels , and this lesson was disregarded . #% We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products . #% Mr President , it is a matter of regret that Parliament has found it impossible to construct a resolution for today 's debate . #% For serious package waste management to be successful such symbols must be easily identifiable by the consumer . #% However we reassert , as we have done consistently , that an effective college requires the assumption of individual political responsibility . #% The economic progress seen over recent years in the EU-15 Member States that enjoyed cohesion funding represents something of a model for what we can do when EU resources are properly targeted and implemented . #% The talks with South Africa have been going on for over three years now and I would call to mind the commitment we have entered into to conclude the EU/South Africa agreement by March at the latest . #% The framework programmes are one of the big success stories of the European Union . #% It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure a coherent strategy against organised crime . #% We as a Parliament must resist the dilution and emasculation of legislation . #% If there was , it would have been found by now . #% Tonight , yet again , he has refused to provide all the information that was sought as far back as 2003 . #% I wish to make three brief points . #% The possibility of strengthening the non-discrimination principle in the Treaty is under consideration at the IGC . #% Is the Council content with this situation and , if not , what action is proposed ? #% I believe the Structural Funds have a very different objective to state aid and I would simply refer to the case of rural areas . #% I think this is unrealistic . #% Mr Aigner , as chairman , fought to have it made a full committee and he also fought to get a Court of Auditors , which we succeeded in getting . #% I do not accept that British fishermen have been wronged , because if you look at the figures the British fishing industry is getting its natural share of European fish . #% No virus has the capacity to comprehend the notions of subsidiarity , proportionality and territoriality . #% Also , during our visit to the prison , the prison governor indicated quite clearly that these three men would not be safe in any prison in Colombia . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their work on what is a very difficult issue . #% On the one hand there are added pressures from the West , mainly from the US and the Cairns Group , as we prepare to start negotiations on the next WTO round and , on the other , there are pressures from the East to reduce the cost of enlargement . #% That side of the House should be thoroughly ashamed of their conduct in the Busquin hearing . #% I am sent here by people to ask questions . #% I am deeply disappointed at some Member States and applicant countries who give military support to the conflict . #% EU Member States should not allow themselves to be bullied into applying an Agreement which fails to guarantee the data protection rights of its citizens . #% Can we remind perhaps the Commission and Council that we are co-legislators , not co-drafters of declarations which have no legal force and rely on the Commission 's goodwill to deliver on must-carry . #% As far as the substance is concerned , we should remember that we live in a global economy , with strong competitors for agricultural trade . #% Until then , however , we have found a way which allows us to continue to enforce our own stricter requirements under the transitional period before we move , in line with other EU Member States , to the general regime . #% 
While we recognise that Tunisia faces a certain threat from extremist elements and is trying to deal with that threat , it must do so in a way that respects human rights standards and democratic standards . #% This problem was further compounded by the decision of the UK , Germany and France to hold a mini-summit prior to the Ghent Council . #% It is madness from an economic point of view , too . #% Taoiseach , there are those who contend that the only truly important issue to be tackled under the sixth Irish presidency of the European Union is that of the completion of the IGC , the issue of the Constitution . #% The European Union is currently dealing with difficult areas such as agricultural affairs , regional policy and budgetary matters . #% However , we are living in a modern world , where there are real terrorism threats both to Europe and to other parts of the world , on which the European Union must take a position . #% Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere . #% For a child , abuse , whether it is at the hand of a lecherous adult or the Internet , becomes a psychological millstone that blights the child for life . #% We only have to look at the progress in some Member States , including the Netherlands , to see that this is a perfectly attainable percentage . #% We have serious political obligations with regard to complying with the Kyoto provisions . #% This plan also proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness , expertise and practice in such areas as appliance purchasing , use of energy in the home , building installations , heating systems and energy management in industry , the services sector and also the public sector . #% How we handle it and how it is detected is absolutely critical . #% This will contrast with the past , when Mr Rothley was working on his own and efforts were made just to get a deal done to give a presidency something to their credit at the end of the day . #% Regrettably such disasters affect many countries at the same time . #% While the arguments in favour of a single currency have been debated at length by economists and public servants and are now well-known to most people working in politics , public administration and finance , the vast majority of Europe 's citizens are still not aware of the range of benefits which the single currency will bring to them . #% Mr President , on a point of order : I would like to request the assistance of my colleagues in Parliament , and indeed of the Commission , following the disaster that struck Dublin in particular last week when it was inundated with serious floods , rendering homeless many frightened people , some elderly . #% People need to be extremely careful how they treat other people in this Chamber . #% We represent their best hope . #% There is no doubt that in areas such as openness , transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people , the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective . #% For example , a synthetic fibre that might be subject to that duty is given added value by making it into a roller blind , whereby it escapes the anti-dumping duty and is dumped in the EU at ridiculous prices . #% Migrants and people from more marginalised communities are also more likely to work in a domestic situation . #% The Commission is always reminding us of this , but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial . #% So , if possible , that vote should be dealt with again . #% Also , the principle of `` progressive access '' will mean that riders must accumulate experience on smaller motorcycles before moving up to larger engines . #% We should be clear about the internal challenges we face : one in five of Europe 's youth is out of work , unemployment among women is consistently higher than among men , long-term unemployment persists as a scourge of modern society . #% Mr President , I hope my voice is going to hold out . #% The report also provides support for , among other things , a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with European policing and anti-fraud . #% Although it has always maintained that it only provided the Khmer Rouge with technical expertise in agriculture , the Cambodian documentation centre recently unearthed evidence to show that it was directly involved in the setting up of the interrogation and torture centre in Phnom Penh where thousands of Cambodians died . #% in writing . - I believe any proposal to increase the EU budget to be unacceptable , on the basis that I can not justify to my constituents increasing EU spending by nearly 6 % in 2011 . #% Given the most recent studies , it is clear that it is technically possible that 95 % of our energy supplies could come from renewables like wind , tidal , wave , solar and biomass by 2050 . #% Is it implementation , or is it a delegated act - in which case it is legislation ? #% Airport charges play a pivotal role in allowing airlines the financial scope to offer customers low cost travel . #% And yet that sector has been ignored for far too long . #% Only 8 % of all municipal waste in Ireland is recycled and this figure is simply too low . #% Madam President , I believe that the EU leaders ' recent meeting in Tampere in Finland was a very successful one . #% Mr President , one of the problems with this report and with the idea that the European Parliament and Members of Parliament and political parties should draw up an electoral system is that they are going to have the interests of the political parties themselves rather than the interests of citizens to the fore . #% My group believes that by proposing this short postponement , the Members concerned will have time to brief their groups on their visit and help produce an improved text calling for the closure of GuantÃ¡namo Bay that , hopefully , all groups can support . #% I would like in conclusion to ask you , Commissioner , about the goals and the timetable for the addition of extra organic chemicals to the list of POPs as set out under the Convention , which were discussed last August . #% The European framework has been good for Ireland . #% They are all issues worthy of debate , but nothing to do with the Nice Treaty . #% It is crucial that the EU applies restrictions on a fishing effort within this area . #% Under Lisbon , this agreement requires the approval of this House and I would guess from my colleagues that the way the agreement is developing , it will receive a cold reception . #% Of the 200 parliamentarians participating in that Convention , only eight signed an alternative text , basically arguing for the disintegration of Europe . #% No doubt many of those free market enthusiasts will be rubbing their hands in glee at such a prospect because they can then pick up what remains of the profitable bits of the Irish market . #% Such self-indulgence must end . #% What is required here is cool heads , dialogue , reconciliation and a respect for the equality of each group to have their own viewpoint , to put forward their own beliefs and to put forward their own ideas for the future . #% In Africa more than 50 species are for sale in markets and restaurants , including antelopes , monkeys , apes , pangolins , pigs , large rodents , elephants , reptiles -- such as snakes , lizards and crocodiles , invertebrates -- such as snails and insects , and birds such as hornbills . #% This text will thus receive maximum support and will give credibility to Parliament in the build-up to the EU-US Summit at the end of June . #% That is wrong and it shows utter contempt for the electors of Europe , not least the electors of Mr Guellec 's own country , who handsomely rejected the Constitution . #% Affordable imports of protein from third countries such as the US are crucial if we wish to ensure food security and create conditions in which farmers can earn a decent living from agriculture . #% Yes , the methodology of the Auto/Oil Programme was innovative but it had two problems : firstly , it took a long time , so that recent worries about , for example , particulates were not covered ; secondly , the European Parliament was involved at a very late stage . #% Every organisation needs to step back and review its methods . #% Antimicrobial administration to both humans and livestock entails the risk of resistance when used incorrectly and at inadequate doses . #% The Republic of Ireland 's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland , but the first time there is a bit of trouble , it runs away ! #% Madam President , the objective of the International Fund for Ireland to break the vicious circle of violence in Northern Ireland by contributing to peace and reconciliation is more important than ever at the moment . #% The problem is that particularly in Germany , social workers seem to be able , under German law , to make decisions about access and custody which , in some cases , take no note of decisions made in courts in other countries . #% Many people have spoken about how best we can deal with this . #% I would like sincerely to thank the Council for its understanding on this significant point . #% Some of the amendments tabled will not facilitate progress with this proposal which , I want to stress , should prepare the way for a humanitarian response to future situations which might arise where a mass influx of people in need of international protection takes place . #% In short , Commissioner , this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate . #% At the same time the European Union , in pursuit of its policies which were forced on us by the clearance group and the United States , has reduced its share of world markets in the dairy sector , in the cereal sector and in the meat sector . #% The European Union has to address this and the dangers this will involve . #% In some parts there are very high levels of unemployment , maybe as high as 75 % . #% We have , as General Morrillon suggests , to ` share the burden ' also . #% Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now , because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks . #% in writing . - At the heart of the financial crisis were banks taking excessive risks and failing to hold enough capital to cover those risks . #% 
People should have the right to defend themselves when they are accused or allegations made against them . #% But it is there . #% Commissioner Barroso and colleagues , please go for it ! #% Rather than going over ground already covered by previous speakers , I would just like to underline that the overall content of what we want to see happening within Parliament with regard to the new Commission is clearly laid out and enunciated within that resolution , which also takes into account the framework agreement as revised . #% It is high time that the international rules governing marine discharges were incorporated into EU legislation and , equally importantly , that such rules were enforced . #% Mr President , I too would like to raise the issue of the visit by the Colombian President , Mr Uribe , to this Parliament . #% I and my group strongly believe that the convention method could be adopted . #% In conclusion , harmonisation is needed and welcomed to the extent that it respects the different range of financial products and the cultural differences in financial services in each Member State . #% I do not want to repeat many of the things colleagues have said here this afternoon , but we have to recognise that at the heart of the tragedy is another generation of little people living in those squalid camps in Palestine who are growing up , and the first game they play is throwing stones at soldiers -- just as they did in Northern Ireland . #% Greenland withdrew from the Union . #% At the heart of the crisis in Pakistan are the feudal capitalist structures under which enormous levels of poverty flourish at the present time . #% The PNR Agreement forms part of the so-called ` war on terror ' and will infringe the civil liberties of Irish citizens . #% First of all , it streamlines the policy , making it simpler and much more defensible within the GATT negotiations , thereby providing longer-term security for farmers engaged in sheep and goat farming . #% It would appear that she is basically a spokesperson for the military and for industry . #% It appears that one country has offered medical supplies , while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support , including aircraft . #% That actually is quite a broad perspective and anything can happen within that . #% I advocate that we vote against the PPE and that we adopt the Socialist report now that the Socialists have withdrawn the amendment , for reasons perhaps better known to some of those in the southern part of Europe . #% This discriminates against the very worthwhile organisations that need support at European level to make their voice heard and it undermines the appreciation of the high quality of their work . #% Our immediate objective must be to restore farmer confidence in the political process and to safeguard the integrity of the common agricultural policy , outside of which EU agriculture will not survive . #% Do I gather then , that the reason we are doing it is because it is good for civil servants ? #% Perhaps we could have an answer before the end of the debate . #% It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals , because jobs are then created within the EU . #% These are consultative-only as far as Parliament is concerned . #% There are a lot more important areas into which EU resources could be going , rather than this : it is clearly in the interests of the military . #% This pays for a massive apparatus of State repression , including over 40 000 policemen whose sole job is to police the Internet for dissent . #% I would propose on behalf of colleagues that we have immediate resuscitation equipment here in the Chamber in case such a distressing event occurs again . #% This would ensure that human rights are given the kind of political priority the Commissioner has spoken of today . #% They have links to that organisation . #% Far too often their contribution to society has been taken for granted and certainly not always adequately rewarded with a reasonable income . #% Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down . #% I therefore welcome the rapporteur 's calls for the improved management of resources , stabilization of incomes , measures to compensate for income losses and the creation of ` SEA LEADER ' programmes . #% The challenge for all of us now is to demonstrate to consumers that the British Government has finally become serious about the eradication of BSE and it must now go about the task with commitment and determination . #% However , my Irish colleagues and I are confident that we are , at long last , on the brink of a lasting solution and that a devolved government will soon become a reality for the long term . #% On managerial skills , you have to inculcate a culture of reform to thousands of people . #% Mr President , a Bilderberg meeting will open in Versailles tomorrow . #% The directive should take a clear stand and insist that the use of these marker genes is stopped now . #% We have already seen the negative effects in publicity terms of the sanctions and how they are being used by Saddam Hussein to beat Western Europe , as well as the Americans and the UN , and to rally his people back . #% It is critical to secure the viability of the emissions trading market in the short term if it is to survive in the longer term . #% It is a complex process , and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation , hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy . #% Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 102 ( 2 ) . #% The conclusions of the Tampere European Council certainly present strong political support for reaffirming the Union 's wish to overcome difficulties with regard to prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime . #% Only when they have made a noteworthy move towards democracy should they be removed from the list . #% In the agricultural industry , as in any other , farmers and livestock dealers have very large vested interests in presenting their product in prime condition in order to command the best possible price . #% The function of such a study must be to clarify the basic principles for the EU - the logistics of implementing that policy can come later . #% Any future agreement must both recognise Israel 's right to live in peace and security and ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are protected and promoted . #% We need the contribution of these people whose livelihoods are at stake . #% I will not bore you with the details , but we finally arrived here . #% I am calling on the European Commission to carry out this independent research in consultation with EU airline companies and EU consumer groups . #% The opportunities now presented to us by this process should be grasped , but it should not be predetermined that everybody gets what they want . #% By allowing more ambitious legislation in some Member States , subject to the close scrutiny of the Commission , and by restricting the marketing of certain products where better alternatives exist , the objectives just mentioned will be given impetus . #% Sales promotions are key tools to marketing goods and services and we need to get rid of restrictions and barriers so as to allow business and consumers to exploit the opportunities of the internal market . #% He contrasts the position in the United States and the European Union in terms of jobs , spin-offs and the development of a scientific culture . #% There can be no excuse for any government to apply the rule of law in a purely partisan way . #% EU environmental and food safety laws can form a safety net between farming and the World Trade Organisation . #% People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable . #% The result of this European Directive , implemented by the Member States , is a total disparity among the Member States . #% However , without the stepping stone of Nice , much of that will be in vain . #% Let us not exclude them for the rare blood groups and for the very scarce plasma and plasma products if they are needed to pay to ensure adequacy of supply . #% Given the globalisation of industry and services , international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all . #% Unfortunately , only 2 % of the aid we send to these developing countries is actually being spent on education . #% I would advise other regions with serious problems of unemployment to study the work of the International Fund in Northern Ireland and the border counties . #% I want to ask him about that flexibility and the mandate he has from the Council of Ministers with regard to trade concessions in agriculture . #% We are committed to a capability for autonomous EU action in my group . #% We have to learn from our mistakes and ensure that , this time , citizens have easy access to all the information they require . #% The challenge , when dealing with something as widespread , serious and preventable as injury , is to save lives and preserve health . #% While accepting in principle the proposal of a European company operating according to the same principles EU-wide , the scope of this proposal should not extend to restricting national taxation decisions , which remain firmly the preserve of individual Member States . #% 
When you look at the situation from that reality , finding a solution or a compromise is not difficult , because despite what some speakers have said , it is not love of one 's country or nationalism that causes war violence ; it is lack of respect , lack of tolerance of differing viewpoints and of diversity within our society . #% After the redundancies - and these were forced , not voluntary , because the redundancy offer on the table involved substantial wage cuts and significant disimprovement of workers ' conditions - the vacancies arising from the forced redundancies were filled by mostly foreign workers , many on half the minimum wage for Ireland . #% Let me say that we should , in any case , be making more use of indigenous energy sources and not relying so much upon imported fuels . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Hieronymi , on her report . #% The rest of the text would have to be deleted because the Australians have removed it from their proposal , although that will not preclude others retabling it at the Conference of the Parties , if necessary . #% Given the opportunity and a favourable community infrastructure , the citizens of rural Europe are actively participating in enterprise programmes , creating much-needed employment and contributing to the sustainability of rural communities . #% We have seen too many treaties from the European Union in the recent past . #% The cost of such procedures will of course be borne only by two groups : farmers and consumers . #% It is a powerfully significant report for the work of this House because it is about legislative quality control . #% This success was not based on a dog-eat-dog approach , but on a social contract which ensured that working people would share in the wealth created , and their dependence on society generally would also benefit through the provision of universal public services . #% A united struggle of Sinhalese and Tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the Tamil-speaking people . #% Could you elaborate on that please ? #% Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one . #% Our wheaten and soda breads are must-taste delicacies and Armagh Bramley apples have a very distinct reputation . #% Fiscal flexibility is paramount to improving European competitiveness . #% What sort of a message do Members want to send from this Parliament ? #% The truth is that the negotiations have been long and protracted , and I certainly welcome the Commissioner 's statement that he is hoping to bring this very shortly to an end . #% We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society . #% It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship , including eventual accession , is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights . #% On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission . #% In contrast to a colleague , Mr Busk , who has just spoken , I do not have problems with vaccinated animals entering the food chain . #% In conclusion , I would welcome any improvements that could be made to the implementation rates for structural-funded programmes and projects . #% That is the way forward for the future . #% Continued publications outlining the damage that narcotic and synthetic drugs can do to users must also be welcomed . #% I hope this report helps fight domestic violence in Europe . #% The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat overshadowed by the substantial interest in paragraph 29 of the resolution . #% If the EU Council Summit at Laeken this weekend only addresses the issue of the strengthening of borders as a response to this modern day slave trade , it will have failed not only to respect these values but also to fulfil its leadership role . #% It is clear that the country needs massive international support immediately . #% This would obviously destroy the beef market , not only in Ireland but in some other places and allow meat factories to further reduce prices to farmers . #% The German Government has done the European Union a service by raising this debate and by posing the challenge of how economic policy should be set and governed in Stage 3 of the Union . #% I would like to make a special reference to the people of Ireland . #% The rapid growth of air conditioning needs to be taken into account more , the possibilities open to Member States in the form of inducements should be clarified , and many of the definitions need to be tightened . #% I know what I am talking about in saying that , because the three principles at the heart of the European Union are exactly the same as the three principles at the heart of our special agreement in Northern Ireland . #% In fact , it was one of the carrots dangled during the single market debate in Europe -- sign on here , vote yes , you will have cheaper cars . #% Mr President , like other speakers , I think it is deplorable that nothing has happened since Parliament 's Echelon report . #% So I started off my political life with the parish plan in my hand and today I have another Parish plan . #% There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying various forms of dangerous cargoes . #% If we are to make any meaningful contribution to the policies proposed as priorities then we have to have at least some expansion in the amount of resources available to us . #% However , this outcome will only come about after years of wrangling and protracted uncertainty for industry . #% There is immense frustration - I am sure not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union - at the scale of distress . #% This is as it should be and it is good news , but we need vigilance . #% The NSRAC has provided a bridgehead for bringing fishing interests , biologists and environmentalists together , getting them to agree collectively on ways of conserving stocks of plaice and sole . #% However , it is a package and there can be no cherrypicking by anyone - the choice is either to accept the package in total or to reject it . #% Lastly , what about CAP reforms ? #% This is very important in light of the key social and economic role the vintage car sector plays in promoting tourism across the length and breadth of Europe . #% The Union must continue to implement uniform and rights-led programmes of education relating to new information technologies , so that all citizens of the Union can be properly integrated into the workplace . #% Yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy . #% It was clear at that time that unless these protocols were taken very seriously , we could end up with a rather dangerous situation . #% Ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago . #% Regrettably its blind allegiance is paradoxically damaging to Israel 's cause . #% Therefore , either some fund should be set up to help grieving families if they find themselves unable to pay the costs of repatriation and if they are not covered by insurance , or perhaps we might look at the social welfare systems across Europe to see if they could be used to help . #% The ordinary Members of Parliament , the elected Members , do not have a say on this and this is very regrettable . #% In my view , it is unfair to blame the workers for constant breakdowns and delays in the train service . #% However , just as I am guided by my own conscience , I do not presume to pass judgement on how other people will act in relation to their own consciences and in very difficult circumstances . #% The state of the Union reflects that where we have the political vision and will , we succeed ; where we lack those qualities , we do not . #% I think the feed industry itself would welcome clarity on that , because too often zero tolerance has given rise to huge costs as well as concern and confusion within that industry . #% I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition , in particular beef and butter . #% We need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the Green Paper and make an evidence-based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments . #% Mr President , yet again we are discussing the issue of terrorism in the context of the appalling atrocity in Bali in which hundreds of people lost their lives . #% The conclusions of the recent Brussels European Council clearly rule out any negotiation on the Berlin Agreement and Agenda 2000 . #% The bottom line is that these new charges will increase the cost of transporting Irish exports into European markets . #% I will give you further information about this . #% Energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the European Union . #% Allied to these exciting developments is the emergence of a Franco-British proposal to establish a force of 40,000 by 2003 to cover all Petersberg Tasks on a permanent basis . #% I also referred to the misuse of technology , such as the Internet by paedophiles . #% In my view , this takes away from the message . #% 
In this respect , I call on the Commission to make a declaration , on the record , that it will be assiduous in pursuing its obligations as enforcer of the Treaty in relation to this regulation and that it will take particular care to police and monitor any stricter measures that are proposed by Member States , in the interests of furthering the internal market within the bounds of Article 175 . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Katiforis and Commissioner Solbes , both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy . #% The reason I gave so much information - like you I had access to this information - was that it could be an attempt by a private company or by groups of private companies to distort the market before the full impact of European Union law becomes legal and to interfere so that no action can be taken afterwards . #% The attempts that have been made at European level to tackle this problem are inadequate . #% A recent survey has suggested that child smoking in Germany alone has increased by up to 50 % . #% Regrettably , the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness . #% Commissioner , I received your letter today after your visit to Ireland , but the last point you raised , which your letter failed to address , relates to the lack of resources in the Legal Unit of the Environment Directorate to deal with complaints . #% Thirdly , the by-catch allowed to be kept by the EU fleet is far higher than what the Guinean fleet is allowed to keep . #% As a result of five increases , export refunds on skimmed milk have risen from EUR 0 to 650 per tonne . #% Therefore , I feel we can not vote on it . #% For better or for worse , we are shaping Europe 's future by how we raise our children . #% author . - I want to congratulate the Commissioner on progress achieved . #% The EU has formal ties with all three countries , with cooperation agreements on Cambodia and Laos in 1997 and Vietnam in 1995 . #% I am in total agreement with , and strongly support , the Commission 's view that there is no link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund . #% Has the Austrian presidency made any efforts to make proposals in relation to transfrontier contamination or emissions or accidents from radiation ? #% The EU ' s history has shown that localised overloading of environmental carrying capacity can be a temporary phase of an emerging economy . #% The Court of Auditors , in this particular report , has drawn attention to the weaknesses in the basic regulations , weaknesses which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to effectively control spending . #% However , we can go further . #% There is a saying of the Chinese that if you love your child send him on a journey . #% the mixing of police , security and intelligence forces , which could lead to abuse of powers against the citizens , as has been seen recently in Ireland ; #% However , I should like to ask , based on that and the assessment you have already made , what further steps the Commissioner would recommend to control the continued emissions of radionuclides from Sellafield and La Hague . #% Even though they do not apply to all the beneficiary Member States in the same way and to the same degree , I subscribe to the rapporteur 's concerns about other environmental aspects relating to the fund . #% Indeed , how does it link this to the Lisbon agenda ? #% It is a serious problem in a small country such as my own . #% It is also worth pointing out that in the original proposal from the Commission a minimum distance from residential areas was included and was later removed by the Council . #% We must include enablement in all our approaches to development in developing countries . #% The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the IPCC , an international panel of experts which assesses the scientific , technical , social , and economic aspects of climate change estimates that we need to decrease our emissions of greenhouse gas by 60-80 % on 1990 levels in order for our efforts to make an appreciable difference to rising global temperatures . #% This kind of approach , separating development from what is actually being paid for the fishing rights is extremely important , as has been mentioned by other speakers . #% I also want to thank the Commissioner for having tidied the whole matter up and made what was certainly an unacceptable situation a bit more acceptable in these renegotiations . #% It may well do more harm than good . #% The UN and the EU must act . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , research and innovation are key to delivering growth and to meeting our biggest challenges . #% Over the last decade national governments in many Member States have devoted much of their energy to creating new job opportunities , in most cases without any significant degree of success . #% We have had the Delors plan for the unemployed . #% Points made in relation to the physiological effects must be reinstated . #% If this issue remains unaddressed , it is not just Sudan that will suffer . #% I feel that not enough has been done at a political level , either by the European Union or the Member States , to deal with the issue of congestion in our skies . #% I see the family as having a very real relevance both at the beginning and end of life . #% It is a ludicrous thought . #% Madam President , I very much welcome the report on SMEs and join with other Members in congratulating the rapporteurs . #% That debate should be in public . #% I can assure you that we checked on that day that the comments we ascribe to the Commissioner were accurate . #% The ICES press release of Monday , which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned , shows that stocks are in grave danger . #% Credit unions are different as they are owned and run by their members . #% This is a fundamentally important social and economic objective if the European Union is to take advantage of new e-commerce and related business activities . #% in writing . - It is with great pleasure that I have voted in favour of naming 2011 as the European Year of Volunteering . #% In this situation , a greater reliance on intermodality is necessary . #% I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion . #% While we are evaluating the added value of the Fund within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual framework budget review , this should , in my opinion , be an ongoing process , and we need to be vigilant in the area . #% The key , of course , is resolution to the intractable problem of the Middle East . #% Last week , business confidence in countries such as Germany was on the increase . #% On a European level I welcome the Commission 's recent stakeholder consultation and hope that we can make our voice heard at the forthcoming COP 10 conference in which I will be delighted to participate . #% But let me repeat what I believe is now coming loud and clear from our regions , municipalities and partners : those on the ground who are using these funds will continue to need funds , but they need to have the certainty and security that agreement can be achieved in Berlin . #% A lot of mention has been made within the report and by colleagues speaking here tonight , and I am sure the Commissioner will also touch on it , about the importance of lifelong learning and education . #% in writing . - Negotiations for a new global climate agreement are now on a knife edge . #% The directive allows a 20-year period for countries which landfill more than 80 % of their waste to come into line . #% The European Union must act to ensure that there are no safe havens in Europe for cyber paedophiles . #% This new protocol with Mauritania is now the Union 's most important protocol with a third country . #% Companies must be afforded the flexibility they need to stay lean and move swiftly in a highly competitive environment . #% We need to improve the service of information to women , both younger and older , about the risks of and availability of treatment for breast cancer in order to ultimately reduce the mortality rate of women and to improve their quality of life and assist them in returning to work if they so desire . #% The earth 's temperature is rising at an alarming rate . #% The right to petition helps to break down barriers and creates a vital link between the working of the EU institutions and our citizens . #% Then , on the other hand , in its document the Commission makes no further reference to the NSRAC 's opinion . #% A strong message has to be sent out and it has to be forced to toe the line on this issue . #% As you may be aware , Mr President , the three men involved were convicted in Colombia of assisting FARC terrorists there . #% An important element in ensuring that this happens , as has already been said by Mr Smith in proposing the resolution , is the role of both the Council and the Commission . #% 
That is not the appropriate place for the decommissionining of the JRC 's facilities . #% Last September it published a report stating that BNFL has high-quality management in terms of health , safety and the environment . #% Unfortunately , today 's choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain . #% Firstly , yes , we need marketing assistance , fleet modernisation , fuel assistance , and proper recognition of the potential needs of inshore fishing , but the imposition of European harmonisation -- fishing gear control , data collection , a new Community initiative -- is the path , I fear , to restriction , not to growth . #% It is intolerable that residents of parts of Valencia face the fact that their property has been and may be expropriated by the local state with the consequent enrichment of developers . #% I hope that has now changed . #% I do not wish , Mr Prodi , to anticipate the hearings of Parliament but I do have a question : in the event that Parliament decided that one ro more of the nominee Commissioners was not acceptable , what would you propose to do , given the powers you have under the Treaty of Amsterdam ? #% in writing . - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel , with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen . #% Madam President , I want to say something briefly about the reports by Mr Iversen and Mr Otila . #% We were disappointed that we did not have some sort of minimum price fixing on imported salmon before the Christmas period . #% Parliament has responded to your leadership . #% Today , more than ever , we need Eurojust and Europol to deal effectively with the individuals who prey on the misery and desperation of others . #% The Employment Committee 's report has considerably expanded this framework . #% Where are EFSA 's studies ? #% I hope that this initiative , tabled by Ireland , France , Portugal , Spain , the UK and Belgium within the UN 's International Maritime Organisation , will have the full support of all current and future Member States . #% Any further contamination , such as another Chernobyl-type of accident , will create an environmental deficit and liability for future generations that makes sustainability an impossible goal to achieve . #% The number of convictions is derisory in terms of the problem ; the police do not see human trafficking as a crime . #% This is a very serious disease that we need to get control of this summer . #% In particular I am looking at people who are at risk , whether because of social problems and their lack of access to formal education , or because of dropping out of formal education and getting involved in crime and other activities . #% But the idea itself is worth exploring . #% With regard to ethical dilemmas in biotechnology , we need to take these , and the efforts to respond to ethical concerns in funding EU research very seriously . #% We need to look at opportunities to give people in the developing world ownership of their development , for example , and specifically to the promotion of land ownership for individuals , families and communities . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome Mr Holmes ' report and hope he makes a speedy recovery . #% He also falsely accused hundreds of MEPs , including 11 Irish MEPs , of ` milking no show loopholes ' in our daily expenses . #% It is a channel providing important opportunities for communicating the key values underlying Europe 's rich cultural heritage and it must therefore be supported in every possible way . #% Any proposals that diminish the representation of small Member States within the EU institutions will fly in the face of the principles of equality that are the stated aims of the European Union . #% I would draw your attention in particular to recitals D and F of the resolution - which time does not allow me to read out - and I would ask you to read them carefully . #% Mr President , the Group has not tabled an amendment to ban doorstep selling , but rather to make it subject to conditions in terms of unsolicited negotiation of credit or doorstep selling . #% It will complement efforts by Member States and will encourage the laggardly Member States to do more . #% True citizenship , however , does not need money thrown at it to make it real or desirable . #% What would happen if this unthinkable scenario became reality ? #% I tend to believe that , to put it bluntly , this is a licence to plunder . #% Employment obviously plays a key role , but it must be remarked that too many of our homeless , and indeed our poor , actually have a job . #% But instead of going for a scientific safety assessment , the directive is based on an outmoded Recommended Daily Allowance dating back to the Second World War . #% The Commission 's proposals regarding direct payments to farmers are an essential element of the overall package . #% Furthermore , should EID be introduced it should only apply to animals born after a certain date and should not apply to existing stock . #% The present force of 7000 African Union troops is ill-equipped and , when you consider that the area they are covering is the size of France , it is quite impossible for them to police it . #% I know that , certainly in the last number of years , the pleasure of going to an airport and boarding an aircraft has deteriorated , not only because of delays for reasons of air traffic control and lack of space , etc. , but also because of delays at airports , baggage retrieval and security - it could be argued that security is necessary . #% The European Union is about to introduce a reform of the sugar regime , which will have serious implications for European farmers and sugar workers if it goes ahead as planned . #% -- Mr McCreevy , you did not need to say anything in Sweden . #% The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture . #% So far a proposal has not come to the Council from the Commission . #% Mr President , I welcome the strategic guidelines on cohesion and the three priority areas identified . #% A serious question mark hangs over the principle of applying state aids in such contexts but my Group would retain an open mind to a fair-minded review and reflection on the facts . #% For me the issue of general-interest services -- both economic and non-economic -- is a line in the sand between those who favour a social market economy model and those who favour a neo-liberal market economy . #% Mr President , in setting out the presidency 's programme with regard to key policy issues , which will be addressed over the next six months by the European Union , the Spanish Prime Minister has stated that his priority of priorities during Spain 's six-months ' presidency of the EU will be the global fight against terrorism . #% The day after tomorrow , the former Minister of Finance , Mr McCreevy , will be sitting on those benches beside you , Mrs WallstrÃ¶m , in charge of the internal market . #% This issue is of enormous importance and the Commission should have come forward with more concrete ideas , rather than referring to various proposals that have already been made by other people . #% I was looking at some figures a few days ago . #% The views of the patient groups , which were very strong at first and second reading , were that we must not rule out remuneration , but it must not be the rule . #% I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , for his statement here today which is most welcome because of its optimism , its encouragement and which gives a clear demonstration of his determination . #% I welcome the debates which took place this week in the European Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources . #% There are many other points including an almost unrestricted Patenting system that force me to vote against this report . #% Amongst the many difficulties we are facing in this area is the very frequent refusal of courts from one Member State to recognize judgments made in another . #% The protection of the European Union 's 370 million consumers is of paramount importance . #% Both identities fully respect principle number one , respect for difference . #% We recognise that standing alone is of little benefit when international cooperation is increasing . #% If we are talking about implementing new forms of work and working time , we must surely know what we are trying to achieve and the basis that we are starting from . #% The unfolding economic policy procedures must not be allowed to lapse into an intergovernmental mode . #% However many finely-worded resolutions we have , as long as we in the Community fail to get to grips with the issues relating to children in our own community , we do not have a strong voice to raise our concerns about this . #% Ireland 's derogation for domestic water charges is not as strong as I would want it to be . #% Credit must therefore be accorded to the Italian presidency for the significant progress that it made on very sensitive issues . #% It is an appalling situation and I would appeal to you to write to all the parties concerned . #% If this had been the case , I would have voted in favour of endorsing the new treaty . #% There is a pressing need , in my view , for the introduction of international legislation to bring the perpetrators of child sex abuse to justice . #% Liberalisation of trade requires liberalisation of human rights in China . #% 
In Ireland , we operate a judicial system whereby one is presumed innocent until proven guilty , whereas the opposite system operates in many other EU Member States . #% Money must be invested in research and development into the diminishing bee population and funding must be made available to schemes which can help . #% There has been an appalling loss of life , the conflict in the region between the Israeli and the Palestinian people has deepened and the hopes of restarting the peace process regrettably have receded . #% Looking to changes ahead , the preparations for the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013 will be an issue during this Presidency . #% The facts are inescapable . #% Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its elegant balance . #% I believe that this is an ineffective proposal because it does not take account of the different legal traditions in the various Member States . #% However , I would warn against making widespread changes or reducing the powers contained within the Stability and Growth Pact . #% It is a matter which is coming to the fore more and more , particularly now that the Cold War is over and the dust is settling . #% The Union is at an historic crossroads and from 1 May 2004 we will be a Community of 25 different Member States . #% Sadly , this progress has not for the most part been shared by people who experience mental illness . #% We should also recall that this is now even more important in light of the new information society that is now upon us . #% I may be paranoid , but I wonder whether industry is behind this attempt to get a reaction from Members of Parliament . #% We looked at the world-class strength of the UK , we looked at fashion , design , IT , just-in-time techniques , and supply chains as Mr Ribeiro said , and we discovered that we can actually learn from other countries . #% We need clear rules to prevent people and organisations from influencing EU decision making in a non-transparent manner . #% Finally , I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission representatives for their work and remind all Members that there is another way under the Brussels I Convention and we can put other mechanisms in place . #% In Ireland we had a particular problem during the debate on the Lisbon Treaty since , whenever something negative arises , we tend to blame the European Union . #% All of these problems have to be tackled . #% Andalucia will be consulted in the normal way through the consultation process with Member States as far as the Council is concerned . #% They certainly have not been told . #% The EU policy in the fight against financial fraud is pursued simultaneously under the first and third pillars of the Treaties . #% I say to the Council that I expected more . #% Let us be realistic , there will always be something more immediately important than protecting the environment . #% I welcome President Santer 's statement today , but since 1989 the European Commission has been slow to recognize the seriousness of this disease and it failed to supervise the British response . #% Therefore I welcome the proposed review of this regulation after four years . #% However , I have some differences of opinion with regard to some of the speeches and comments . #% Another called it a summit of impasse with a facade of forced smiles . #% It is clear that a peaceful outcome to the current crisis is still possible . #% We will , no doubt , continue cautiously , but progress is surely being made in recognizing that the guarantee fund is a vital part of the future for the European film industry . #% This procedure is fairly meaningless because , taking into consideration the budget constraints together with the GATT decisions , we have very little capacity to influence the price that farmers can obtain for their produce . #% There is absolutely no point in throwing further funds into the bottomless pit of economic collapse in Russia , especially when there is continued political maladministration and corruption . #% Now is the time for each of us , on both sides of the pond , to take a step back and allow things to calm down . #% Indeed , consumers in nine Member States , including Ireland , have been penalised by a measure which has reduced their purchasing choices . #% Mr President , as Mr Wolf rightly pointed out , it is a question of the EU 's credibility in tackling unemployment and it is a fact that the EU overall has an appalling record on job creation . #% We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage . #% In this regard the unique role of farmers as guarantors of food security and quality is far too often taken for granted . #% From my dealings with the office , I have found that they aid the Irish citizens thoroughly and professionally and by voting in favour for the passing of this report , it shows the faith I have in the office . #% While there is a debate on the ethics about how animals are being fed , it must be borne in mind that the alternatives sometimes pose even bigger ethical questions . #% I also want to say that George Orwell would find it difficult to create characters like Rumsfeld , Cheney and Ashcroft . #% I welcome proposals for network access for renewable energies . #% The Union runs the risk of a prolonged period of uncertainty and crisis , and stands on the threshold of sending deeply negative and dispiriting signals to applicant states . #% Therefore I believe that legislative intervention should only be used as a last resort and to address proven market failure . #% This does nothing to redress the issue . #% UK barometer-making , like that in other Member States , is a traditional industry dating back several centuries . #% As a Community of 25 members , the Union is now in a much stronger position than ever to promote policies on the international stage with vigour and determination . #% The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies . #% I have to say that I am disappointed that the coastal states did not reach an agreement in Oslo at the beginning of March . #% The Commission sought to take into consideration all well-founded scientific and experimental evidence in preparing its proposed recommendation . #% Mr President , I noticed that Mr Kirkhope did not describe the IRA , and nor indeed did Mr Allister , as a fundamentalist Roman Catholic organisation , and they were quite right not do so . #% These agreements are to speed up the procedure of deportation and fall far short of what should be done . #% The proposal envisages 2003 as a preparatory year , with some activities beginning to coincide with the academic year 2003-2004 . #% On the contrary , over the past decade , the gap between rich and poor , between the ` haves ' and the ` have nots ' , between the well fed and the hungry has grown even wider . #% It seems to me , for example , that the problem exists , not just within the European Union , but with citizens of the European Union plying this terrible trade outside the Union where a single market does not exist . #% The Italian Government is not respecting those norms by any measure , and I would urge the Commission to insist that the Italian Government -- and indeed any other Member State , if it is in breach of these norms -- be hauled before the European Court of Justice to ensure that these laws are respected . #% The report also deals with trafficking in human beings , the role of international business and its responsibilities in the human rights field and , perhaps most important of all , the issue of impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court , which deserves the support of the European Union . #% He has done it . #% But , in giving away those individual rights and freedoms , we also expect the same responsibility on the part of those in power . #% Life is still cheap in the Middle East and we will continue to count the cost of the recent war for a very long time . #% I would like to thank you , Mr President and colleagues , for the moment 's silence for the awful tragedy which took place only this week in my own home county of Wexford in Ireland . #% Special needs children were regularly denied appropriate education and therapy , and you left public housing lists to grow and grow . #% I believe that the European Union can play a constructive role firstly in ending the violence in the Middle East and then putting in place structures whereby peace talks can recommence between the various factions . #% People involved in it need some predictability for their business margins . #% People here praise the Amsterdam Treaty for the fact that now human rights will be brought into the treaties . #% To overcome this , Members have suggested that we bring in differential tax incentives to give encouragement and so on . #% There are specific criteria that we would like to follow . #% This directive would have had no effect on the acquis communautaire of employment rights in the EU , or in the national Member States . #% 
Is it just to suit two DGs which could not come up with a cooperative proposal ? #% We finished up as the United States ' junior partner instead of an equal one . #% The IAEA has confirmed that 75 % of the notifications of incidents involving nuclear material in the last year were illegal activities . #% A great many of our children have suffered . #% From the wealth of letters and comments that I have received as a member of the Legal Affairs Committee , I know it is not possible to please all interested parties . #% This must be recognised at Vienna as , indeed , must the renewed interest in Malta . #% The process has therefore been thorough . #% I would like to say that , in general , a more client-focused approach by all of the institutions would make you redundant , though I do not think that will happen in the near future . #% I think that is what Europe needs today : a greater understanding that there is a return on the investment made in terms of time and effort . #% First of all , the main reason why businesses relocate within the European Union is not simply because of structural funds or other incentives but maybe because people in those areas have the capacity to work harder and more efficiently and perhaps there is less tax to be paid in those Member States . #% The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one . #% in writing . - Given the economic crises the EU is facing , it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group and as a very , very proud Irishwoman , I would like to pay tribute to John Hume and to say how pleased and delighted we are that he finally received his just reward and recognition with award of the Nobel Prize , both to himself and to David Trimble . #% I know it is in full sympathy with the views of this Parliament but it sees the draft document as a realistic or pragmatic acknowledgement of what is politically attainable at this stage . #% It is the position of my group that we accept and promote the parallelism and the strong complementarity between a Members ' Statute and reform of the travel allowances . #% Mr President , I am disappointed that the Commissioner is not here but I fully appreciate that he is ill and wish him well . #% Islam , I have said many times , has in many ways been demonised , mostly by people who know nothing about it . #% We have tried to help investors with the contents of the summary and the concept of key information . #% So I would ask the Romanian authorities to look at that again . #% Therefore , can the President-in-Office give us a commitment that he will bring it forward at the next Council meeting to see if there can be a reversal of the decision or an extension of some kind ? #% Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and the Commissioner for her interest and , indeed , involvement in this important issue . #% We will not defeat terrorism , whether it be national terrorism , whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind , unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror . #% Our objective should always be to achieve the Millennium Development Goals . #% By April 2005 , the H5N1 virus had also moved to pigs . #% We are amending or reviewing this directive in parallel with the veterinary medicines directive and they are related . #% Many Irish missionaries are involved in this work . #% Finally , I find it intolerable that in a major capital city like Dublin we still have an inefficient bus service from the airport to the city centre . #% The Secretary-General of the Hague Convention , Mr Duncan , will be absolutely delighted at the speed , efficiency and care with which Mrs Hermange has brought her report to us . #% It is 49 pages covering 593 different initiatives . #% In conclusion , we are only spending 1 % of the 1.2 % of GDP currently available . #% However , in my view , the draft resolution by the President of the General Assembly is a reasonable attempt to do just that , an effort to find common ground . #% Mr President , military intervention should only be used as a last resort and to use it now in Iraq would be premature and unjustified , with far-reaching consequences beyond its immediate target . #% It is completely unjustifiable that this Parliament should vote to allow that situation to remain for 10 years . #% We can not go on haemorrhaging indigenous jobs in the pursuit of what really is an unacceptable dogma . #% We are threatening their state of stocks which is going to force us to reduce the turnover of the fishing communities . #% Do they not worry ? #% As has already been mentioned , this has been adopted by this Parliament ; this Parliament itself operates by it and the Council operates by it . #% It has to be the interests of all those people that attended the Commission hearing . #% Given the increased frequency of flights and the huge number of passengers flying nowadays , harmonisation of safety standards at the highest , scientifically supported safety level is imperative , in order to create a level playing field within the enlarged EU . #% Furthermore , these points are extremely important because one relates to actions to prevent pollution-related diseases , one to combating pollution-related diseases and , finally , one to the whole issue of allergies . #% This proposal is one of the measures provided for in the Commission 's White Paper on Food Safety . #% In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways . #% Sometimes very small quantities of soya are used , for example in sauces and soups . #% That is very worrying and the concern is well founded . #% In fact the murder of the journalist Veronica Guerin in my country galvanised politicians and police into action which smashed a savage gangster culture in Ireland . #% Fine Gael and Labour are part of the PPE and S&D groups respectively in this Parliament . #% We have to try to find ways by which we can control the disease of BSE and TSE and at the same time create the consumer confidence that is needed because consumer confidence has been lost . #% As an island , we are very dependent on air travel for both tourism and business and , as one of the most open economies in Europe , we have , over the past decade , reaped the benefits of liberalisation of EU regulations regarding air services . #% In 1995 600 , 000 were exported from the EU and half of those came from Ireland . #% The American model is obviously an attractive template . #% As we have seen with the most recent enlargement , it is one which continues to progress . #% Regrettably the take-up and use of these funds by the Member States is still deplorably low . #% A report is in preparation on the issue of funding for the European schools to enable children with special needs to be catered for , in the same way that all children attending European schools are catered for , free of charge with compulsory education . #% Much of the pollution that occurs in Community waters , as has been said already , is either deliberate or avoidable . #% But if you ask an anthropologist or anyone involved in any of the sciences , this was highlighted 15 years ago as an issue to be dealt with by 2015 . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs are responding to the public 's call for fair taxation of the financial sector . #% I am not a pacifist - although I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with being a pacifist - but I am seriously concerned about the impact that a unilateral war against Iraq will have on the future of the world order , and the kind of world we will live in , if we do not , as a Parliament , make our position clear : unless we have international law moderated through the United Nations , we will have no law . #% Having looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years , one of the things that strikes me is : what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy ? #% I do not think that any national government would apologise for having taken in too much revenue . #% I am still coming to terms with what I saw there . #% . -- Mr President , I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur and indeed everybody involved in reaching an agreement which has produced a joint text on this important regulation concerning the Aarhus Convention . #% We have a terrible problem here because , as George Lyon said , there are 83 million eggs - we know that for a fact - which , on 1 January 2012 are going to be illegal . #% Mr President , I supported the joint resolution on depleted uranium and I welcome the fact that Parliament decided to retain the reference and the call for a moratorium on these weapons . #% There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive . #% I should just like to say to Commissioner Kinnock that I will certainly write to him specifically about the Australian information . #% Apart from the seriously upsetting and devastating consequences of BSE , which I believe will be overcome , the real problem for young people who in normal circumstances would take up farming as a career is the availability , welcome though it is , of alternative and certainly more financially rewarding employment . #% 
We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long-term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO2 and their impact on the environment . #% I would go as far as to say that it is a derogation of our public duty to not ask questions about this serious issue . #% It can be done ; the technology is there . #% We have to do everything to ensure that this woman 's sentence is commuted and that there is a stay of her execution . #% I am very pleased that the Commission has raised the human rights question with the Vietnamese authorities and I should like an assurance today from Commissioner Van den Broek that , on behalf of the Commission , he will maintain this approach . #% The judicial authorities in the United Kingdom and Spain have to go through the correct processes . #% From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process . #% Mr President , I would like to warmly congratulate all who have been involved in the hard work of bringing these reports to a coherent , positive and even strong conclusion . #% Thank you for what you have done for this Parliament . #% I found many very strong arguments in favour of the Gallagher amendments but , in the end , voted with my group to maintain political cohesion within the group . #% I would urge those who have information to come forward and give that information to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and put it on record , and finally bring an end to this . #% The tragic death of these eight people , including four children , found in the freight container just highlights the daily plight of many asylum-seekers and refugees throughout the European Union . #% Mass struggle is needed , in particular , the creation of independent , democratic mass organisations of the working class . #% In most countries the milk gave a higher economic return than , for example , breeding beef - certainly that was the experience in Ireland and the UK . #% It is one which has driven people in the past into physics , and it is very serious if we have a diminution in the number of people studying that subject . #% How then can the Council continue to ignore the democratic decision of the Austrian people ? #% The Intergovernmental Conference should address the job-creation and job-security issues by ensuring that the proposals for revising the Treaty include specific commitments to give increased priority to measures to improve the competitive position of EU industry in the international market . #% Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU 's negotiating mandate at WTO level , as approved by the Council in 1999 . #% In the grey economic space , the budget was inflationary , but , on the supply side , the tax change will bring greater participation in a stretched labour force . #% Action needs to be taken quickly to ensure that adequately skilled workers are available to fill these positions . #% We have failed to do that so far . #% The European Union and national Member States must work closely together at all times with Europe ' s motor and oil industry so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future . #% Even if we succeed in keeping global warming at safe levels , climate change entails unavoidable consequences which require adaptation efforts . #% It would be an extremely important achievement throughout the Union if our young citizens got free access to these services at a training level . #% I would like to echo the Commission 's comment that this report follows the Mercury Strategy which was passed in March of last year , and want to encourage the Commission in its ongoing work on the Mercury Strategy . #% I would like to follow up on Mr Titley 's question . #% Animal welfare is an area that concerns all in the sector . #% I shall forward to you the letter from the FrontLine organisation urging you to demand that the Colombian authorities release immediately the members of Fensuagro in the absence of any valid legal charges , and ensure that lawful trade union organisations can operate free from intimidation . #% I should like to propose that to Members as a technical amendment . #% The unionists are a minority on the island of Ireland , the nationalists are a minority within Northern Ireland . #% I believe the appointment of an EU Aids ambassador would enhance the international effort to combat the spread of this tragic disease . #% This needs to be addressed . #% I fear that will be impossible if we do not implement adequate vocational training systems geared towards concerned groups of the inshore fisheries population , not least the development of marketing skills . #% We need a guarantee by the Council and the Commission that ACTA will not necessitate any changes to EU law as far as criminal measures relating to the enforcement of intellectual property rights are concerned . #% For example , let us not forget the recent conflict in the Balkans where we were criticised for our impotence . #% Since the provision of abortion is not an EU competence and since the principle of subsidiarity is enshrined in the Treaties I have no choice but to reject this report . #% Will you give us an assurance that you will come back to this House in March with a proper proposal as to what you intend to do - what measures you intend to bring in - to actually control this situation ? #% I totally condemn all terrorism , whatever its source , and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation . #% But by making unemployment on its own a criterion , it may well open up other areas for funding which may not achieve the objective which the Member would necessarily want to achieve in certain regions . #% I ask Parliament and the Commission to give every support to this joint resolution . #% First , it does not seem to have as great or as damaging an impact on wild birds as it does on domesticated or commercial flocks . #% I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families . #% We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and , in a war situation , there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as ` collateral damage ' . #% I agree with the rapporteur on this point . #% In particular , I welcome the funding for sustainability and renewable energy in this programme . #% If what we do and the legislation we pass is not soundly based in scientific rigour , we bring all the EU regulatory processes into disrepute ; and we are going down this road with many of the issues before us in these reports here today . #% Of particular note is the fact that the growth of the US economy , which has outperformed Europe 's economy since Lisbon -- the gap has grown , not lessened -- is driven by its superior research and development . #% It was difficult to find somebody who could encapsulate all the desires and wishes of all the Member States , someone who will also have the necessary degree of independence to give proper political leadership to the Commission in the future . #% But the East Timorese resistance leaders are still in prison . #% We will have something like 80 % of the economy of the European Union in the system and there will be one or two countries who want to join but whose currencies are too weak . #% We are using taxpayers ' money to subsidize an inhumane way of treating animals . #% The provision of water for domestic needs , as a necessity of daily life , for economic needs and for farming and other activities must be guaranteed . #% My criticism of it would be same criticism I have applied to the IRA in Ireland for very many years : that it was engaged in a useless , pointless , undemocratic way of seeking to pursue its objectives . #% The European Parliament has no power or authority to vote itself codecision powers . #% in writing . - The global financial and economic crisis has hit the developed world so deeply that we are now struggling with a social and unemployment crisis . #% Mr President , that last contribution is a sad reminder that the doctrine of bigotry is alive and well in certain parts of this Union . #% But , as several speakers have already said , we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country . #% Mr President , rarely do we hear a subject discussed in this Chamber which brings so many groups together in enthusiasm . #% And yet they are being inexplicably excluded from the proceedings . #% If that is the case , the Commission should be concerned about animals whose breeding was partially funded by the EU . #% There is also the deepest concern with a Charter of Fundamental Rights , clearly intended to be legally binding in 2004 , as a constitution or constitution-treaty , which through the decisions of the EU Court of Justice could take precedence over our Irish Constitution and our Courts . #% In essence , we have gained an extra year on the timetable , which essentially means that further steps in protecting our coastal zone will come sooner rather than later . #% This is essential to ensure safety , particularly in emergencies . #% The fact that half the new projects fail within five years surely indicates that we have neglected to provide their promoters with assistance in the research , market development and management skills which are so essential for their survival . #% This is therefore something we would put down as a marker . #% Yesterday 's announcement of over EUR 420 million in European Union humanitarian aid for Haiti shows leadership and commitment , but its delivery must be coordinated and effective . #% 
This really falls short of what we are required to do under international law . #% Asking directions of a gentleman I passed , I was told ` well , I would n't start from over here ' . #% As a Union we facilitate the free movement of persons . #% Mr President , I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply mentioned the Kyoto Protocol . #% Failure to do this would be a dereliction of duty and we must insist on the right of Member States to continue the policy . #% I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there . #% Of course , we want a strong Europol in the longer term , and even a better , more cooperating Europol where that is necessary . #% I support the continuation of each Member State of the Union having the right to appoint a nominee as a full voting member of the European Commission . #% I find that very frustrating . #% Even where they are , what will it take to get us out of our cars ? #% We now have a growing phenomenon of so-called data streaming - hacking into computer systems and stealing credit card details in bulk . #% I told you in July that in the United States they have on record the National Institute for Missing and Exploited Children over 367 , 000 children . #% We need to push for deeper involvement of national and transnational parliamentary assemblies in the works of the UN system , so as to strengthen its legitimacy and democratic nature . #% It also seeks plans to develop methodological guidelines and undertake new data collection efforts to obtain comparable statistical data on gender-based violence in order to identify the extent of the problem and to provide a basis for a change in action towards the problem . #% There have been key developments taking place in this regard , which have been mentioned by others . #% There is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted , listened to , and be in the hands of people who have no right to them . #% I welcome the strong commitment given by AKP deputy leader Mr Abdullah Gul during his recent visit to Brussels to continue with the reform programme . #% It is crucial that a distinction should be made between commercial services and public services , and that public services such as water , sanitation and energy should not be dismantled or undermined in the GATS . #% I fully support the committee 's enhancement of the directive . #% We should brace ourselves within the European Union for more revelations of collusion between the police and politicians . #% On the basis of the EU 's own figures , Egypt is expected to lose 1.5 million jobs . #% On the Stability Pact , the Liberal Group welcomes the emphasis placed by Parliament on the need for interest on deposits and on fines which arise under this pact to be , in principle , assigned to own resources . #% This forum will undertake the process of consultation and dialogue on EU policy with the Irish public on matters of concern to them . #% We will vote against that amendment . #% Is it not time that we named and shamed those Member States who are not taking the actions necessary to improve entrepreneurship and competitiveness ? #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her lengthy reply , much of which I have heard before . #% The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard . #% I welcome the Ombudsman 's suggestion that there be a much closer working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman 's office with regard to the legal implications of some of the cases that come before us . #% The partnership principle is fundamental to enhancing the democratic credibility of the funds that we use back in our regions . #% There can not , and we must stop this exploding of these toxic materials in the atmosphere for the good of the citizens of the world and for the sake of the planet . #% Under the common fisheries policy , and indeed under other EU policies , there has been a tendency to make policy decisions without full consideration of the valuable views of those working and living in the sector concerned . #% In my opinion , the Commission 's approach to this whole problem is a negation of its responsibility on conservation and sustainability of stocks and a recipe for conflict . #% This policy is a uniform European-wide programme , and forcing national governments to contribute up to 25 % of the agricultural budget would clearly fragment and distort the workings of the CAP . #% But what we hear are words and more words of support instead of actions on the ground . #% There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies , purchased , birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process . #% If their representatives do not reflect their will , they are replaced . #% I strongly support the EU-US transatlantic alliance , but not in its present form , where we are simply expected to endorse US foreign policy objectives , even when we disagree with them . #% There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation . #% This report was careful to emphasise the solidarity between the generations and is clever to ensure that nobody thinks that there is one single solution to the ageing society and the problems that are entailed with it . #% There is a particular need to follow up on research in relation to the effect of breast implants and , as has been pointed out by Mr Miller , implants in other parts of the body . #% Regarding the subject of the report - the safe and humane transport of animals - we all accept without hesitation that this is a fundamental requirement . #% Was it purely technical , to comply with your obligation to revert to Parliament by 30 June , even though you are a couple of months late ? #% It does not help that a leading Eurosceptic has been promoted to full cabinet rank . #% Our concern must be for those we represent : customers both commercial and - the majority of us - domestic . #% Let us put more money in the budget , change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener . #% I would like to know , in the time that you have left , would the Council be prepared to look at ways in which this particular deadline could be avoided and examine possible alternative policies to compensate for any negative impact in the regional area and the tourism area . #% In our desire to compensate all farmers affected , and in particular the farmers most affected , we should try avoid introducing an over-bureaucratic system which would only tend to slow down the payment of compensation . #% Preserving the flexibility of Member States to decide what taxes to apply and at what rates is vital in achieving the social and economic objective of a country . #% While there appears to be some consensus emerging on decoupling , I have reservations about the long-term implications for a commercially focused EU agriculture . #% My second area of objection to this directive is its scope . #% In view of this democratic deficit , I must be thankful that we have an Ombudsman to fight our corner -- a corner that , in a democracy , we should be able to fight ourselves . #% That is a lie . #% Biomass offers farmers and rural areas a real possibility of generating new sources of income through the cultivation of crops such as sugar beet , cereals , oil seeds , short-rotation forestry and hemp . #% The final text which we will vote on tomorrow is to be welcomed as the fruit of successful negotiation . #% Mr President , pursuant to the rules brought in by the Bureau , I wish to put on record that I am present but did not partake in the vote . #% Both gentlemen highlighted the lack of progress to date at the IGC negotiations . #% Again , I thank both Commissioners for their presentation . #% Here we have a different situation . #% You did so despite the fact that Member States received full weekly reports of our observations . #% With the completion of enlargement , Europe has the potential to be a dominant player in world trade . #% I am not aware of any pressure from any of the states mentioned in the question for improved dialogue with the Union and I believe that the dialogues which exist are working reasonably satisfactorily . #% During earlier debates in this House I said the purpose of modern plant breeding is to improve quality and increase the resistance to disease while also increasing the yields of cultivated plants . #% Unless we have proper measurements then it is impossible to monitor the effectiveness of control programmes or the full extent of the threat from global warming to ` future generations ' . #% Nevertheless , the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry should never compromise or put at risk the health of human beings . #% It is a great boon to the numerous voluntary organisations in all of our Member States of the EU . #% in writing . - I welcome this report as an important step forward in the battle against dementia . #% 
It is not a question of having done nothing alone . #% They have a social conscience and favour enlargement . #% Mr President , with regard to this particular resolution , let me say I am appalled at the opportunist hypocrisy of certain groups and certain individuals in this House . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Mr President , I condemn the arrest of Ai Weiwei and call for his immediate release . #% We live in an internal market with free movement of goods , persons , services and capital . #% I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world . #% So it is felt that the European Union has failed to bring about a single market in the whole area of insurance . #% We often debate resolutions in this House about human rights lawyers and journalists being assassinated in the exercise of their duty in other parts of the world . #% President Barroso said here today in Parliament that climate change and energy are some of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next ten years . #% Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage . #% I would like a response on that . #% That is why I am particularly satisfied that in the context of broader EU budgetary policies , the EU leaders are making provision to safeguard the viability of the common agricultural policy now and into the future . #% Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-stop re-run of the Delors White Paper . #% That is why the Committee on the Environment took out all mention of health programmes from the document . #% No-one can deny the benefits funds have brought to poor communities in industrial , urban and rural areas . #% Sinn FÃ©in is not and has not been doing enough to bring justice to this horrid affair . #% We are so upset we were not included . #% In 2005 we saw a 4 % growth rate in overseas visitor numbers . #% The United Nations wrings its hands , the EU has stood back , but South Africa -- the model of peaceful ethnic resolution -- surely should take the lead . #% Furthermore , I feel it is important to underline that protein is a necessary component of animal diets and the current feed ban is placing us in a precarious position regarding protein supply for animal diets . #% Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements . #% In an ideal world it would be achievable but the problem is that producers must give evidence of health claims made for their product . #% There is growing appreciation in Ireland that clean drinking water is a scarce resource and that all services , particularly the cost of distributing clean water to all households , have to be paid for . #% Also , his comments here this evening were thoughtful and informative . #% It makes sense to accept a scheme that is mandatory at the level of Member States as all states must participate in the effort to reduce emissions . #% If a government wanted to kick start an economic activity , through the granting of tax credits for Research and Development , that Member State would have to gain prior approval from the Council under unanimity . #% Hopefully , all existing Member States will have seen the light and be participants in the single currency before enlargement so that the applicants will have no choice on this issue . #% This debate about decommissioning comes at an opportune time , and in our discussions with the applicant countries in the enlargement process we must press for the decommissioning of plants that are unsafe . #% I would hope that Britain will not be allowed to engage in sudden devaluations of the pound sterling . #% It is something that we can all support . #% More work needs to be done in order to improve the Irish transport and environmental protection infrastructure and bring them up to European standards . #% It was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme . #% Mr President , I welcome the European Union initiative in January to break the current WTO deadlock on developing countries ' access to affordable medicines , particularly those countries which do not have the manufacturing capacity to make generic medicines locally . #% Mr President , I compliment Mr Bowe on his work in this area . #% I believe that European Union airlines should not be afraid of addressing the issue of deep-vein thrombosis . #% Prison terms of up to three years can be imposed . #% We must implement initiatives which guarantee that older people in our society can lead fulfilling lives with confidence and with a full sense of reassurance that their needs are fully protected . #% Finally , as regards the period of reflection on the Constitution , I consider it wrong to call it a constitution , and was delighted that the Foreign Ministers said in Austria that it was wrong to do so . #% There are no simple mathematical formulae which can be worked out in advance . #% Mr President , the action programme for education and training reflects the need to establish a proper legal basis for providing grants for organisations engaged at European level in the education and training fields . #% Mr President , I welcome the reference to the Treaty of Nice in Paragraph 6 of the joint resolution . #% I , like most of my colleagues , am an ardent supporter of the aims of the Socrates programme and have witnessed its benefits to education and to local communities . #% I welcome the agreement which has been secured between the European Parliament and the European Council which represents the fifteen Governments of the European Union on this specific directive . #% The budget this year is 2 % more in real terms than we started with last year , and in real terms it is more than 5 % , when you consider the outturn . #% They had tried to negotiate one of those dreadful Irish country roads in the dark and they were not used to the different driving conditions of Ireland . #% Many of us had hoped that the single market would have produced strong competition in the insurance sector , resulting in lower premia for consumers . #% Mr Chichester may hold those views , but they were not for this report . #% Are you aware of this , Commissioner , and can you do anything about it ? #% He is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule , if he should so wish . #% We understand that it was not formally transmitted to the Member States in the Council . #% However , the report in no way affects the legislative programme , which is addressing such issues as traceability , labelling and liability . #% Such feed should only be used for this therapeutic purpose ; they should only be used under strict licence and under strict supervision . #% Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling ? #% In conclusion , as regards the future of Ireland within the European Union , we are fully committed to the operation of the internal market and to the single currency . #% The number of `` no '' voters in Ireland has not grown . #% I urge this House to stress to the Commission and the Council that , while we may be counting beans in terms of budgets , they are dealing with people and families and their actions are having a very severe impact on them . #% The German presidency can take solace from the fact that the spending parameters for the budget for the Union for the period 2000-2006 commands the confidence and the good will of all the Member States of the European Union . #% In my view , the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security . #% This means the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories . #% We all want to see the welfare of animals being transported long distances protected . #% I am confident that both sides can reach agreement on these chapters of the talks and reach a conclusion that is - and must be - fair and balanced . #% I have to ask why all these ships are going such a great distance to catch 3 000 tonnes of tunafish . #% It seems a long time since I tabled an amendment for a derogation -- not from the targets , but from the timetable -- for Ireland , Greece and Portugal and I thank colleagues for their understanding . #% The efforts at Community level complement those of Member States . #% It does not work that way ; we can not make that happen ; that is one of the great misunderstandings . #% It is an exceptional measure for Ireland and Northern Ireland . #%
