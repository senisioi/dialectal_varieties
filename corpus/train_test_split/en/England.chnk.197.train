on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I would like in the very short time allocated to me to make one or two observations , offering perhaps some words of caution . #% However , one of the most important areas is the deinstitutionalisation of disabled people , but this needs a sufficient level of Community-based quality services . #% At a time when we hear that the Commission is about to repeal or will not proceed with over-regulatory legislation , we are faced with the proposals we are now debating . #% The result has been that those who chose to use those rights have seen ten years of pay freeze , ten years of a freeze on any chance of career promotion , and removal of pension rights . #% We shall continue to work for a final outcome which will meet with our stated policy requirements . #% One should not forget that Article 1 of the Olympic Charter states that countries should enjoin ` universal fundamental ethical principles ' . #% Now if all Member States genuinely observed their obligations under the ECHR , there might be no need for EU measures . #% First , it limits the written questionnaire that is sent out by committees to Commissioners beforehand . #% So we are dealing with a situation where , in many areas , there has been almost no expenditure whatsoever under certain budget lines for the Community 's structural funds . #% So both sides , the GAM and the Indonesian Government , must get back to the negotiating table , stop the fighting and resume the talking . #% In an increasingly globalised world , the preparedness of other countries ( or lack of it ) will affect Britain too . #% It originated with a Member State but we are not giving an opinion on the actual proposal which was put to the Council . #% I totally back the call to include a reference to sport in the Amsterdam Treaty . #% We must have proper checks on the readiness and the value of our contingency plan . #% I have never believed that . #% This offers great benefits to society , and economic opportunities for those of us who take a lead , but why are we not able to pursue this more effectively ? #% Will the agenda be finished or will some reports be postponed ? #% Surely that would be the appropriate Treaty amendment to bring forward in the next IGC . #% Yet we still ask for indefinite inspections , surely that is simply because we do not want to have to make a decision . #% But as Mr Bushill-Matthews said , that abuse is not as widespread in the UK as the rapporteur leads us to believe . #% So we want to provide consumers once again with a simple , standardised legal framework , comprising a limited number of fundamental rules that are applicable whatever the nature of the transaction . #% Still not enough is being done by Member States . #% In particular , it is critical to ensure that the women in some of the most vulnerable circumstances , such as in ` trafficking of women ' , fall under this assistance . #% My reasoning is threefold : what substantive evidence do we have that the audiovisual observatory is doing the job that we want ? #% We must have proper transparency on state aid , competition policy and public procurement because , if enlargement is to work , the business community and trade unions have to be convinced that there will be fair play . #% And we want to see high-quality public services . #% Every journey begins with a first step . #% It would be very helpful if you could explain these in more detail to Members of this Parliament who persist in describing this directive in the entirely unjustified terms you have so convincingly dismissed in your answer of ` social dumping ' and a ` race to the bottom ' . #% Mr President , does the Commissioner agree with me that there seems to be a new and growing abuse of children which is within the competence of the European Union ? #% Is this the start of EU harmonisation of tax policy across the Union -- something they said would never happen ? #% I hope you will all support this report and the measures contained within it . #% Again , I totally agree with the rapporteur that we need to ensure that the definitions and the technological solutions we come up with will help these favoured users , whether geographically or socially excluded . #% An example of this : for a leading tomato grower in Britain currently paying GBP 363 000 for its gas and GBP 60 000 for its electricity , the proposed climate change levy in Britain would increase its energy bill by GBP 149 000 . #% But of course , legally , the Lisbon Treaty is dead . #% I believe we are doing a good thing here : it is not about tax harmonisation , it is about the internal market and our environment . #% It is certainly our intention to have another programme . #% It is most important for this debate not just to focus on this or that sector , textiles today or footwear or machine components tomorrow . #% To me it seems quite self-evident that the treatment of metals should be different from the treatment of perishables like coffee , cocoa , sugar etc. and the expanded matrix is simply trying to make sense of the need to treat things like tin , copper , silver differently from commodities like cocoa and coffee . #% I should like to underline the words of the President-in-Office when he emphasised that the Vienna European Council spoke only of a possible extension of the duty-free regime and said that this would be for a limited period of time . #% In this context , where the officers who deal with transport matters also deal with crime , such as burglary and other accident prevention , Community requirements in this specific area will almost certainly lead to a distortion of priorities , dictated not by local needs but by a supranational authority which has neither knowledge nor understanding of local conditions . #% It has recently been in the news , following the 27 February parliamentary elections , when election irregularities caused widespread protest , starting in the south of the country . #% May I suggest that you have a roll-call vote and then you have a record so you can make a check . #% In addition , the suggestion that there should be additional freedom of movement of persons for all neighbouring countries would undermine the existing attempts to limit large-scale immigration into the EU . #% For my own report I am indebted to the Commission , the shadow rapporteurs of all parties and all those who have worked with me to produce a consensual report , notably my own former researcher , Michelle Smyth , whose intermediary skills have now been transferred to our National Consumers ' Association . #% Last week the press reported her as saying that the EU had created a net 12 million jobs over the last six years and that the EU ' s rigid labour market was not the main problem facing Europe 's economy . #% British Conservatives do not like to abstain in the fight against racism but must do so on this occasion for the above reasons . #% That did not get the support I would have liked in committee , and I would therefore recommend to the House that the compromise proposed by Mrs Lynne in Amendment No 24 of 12 hours ' prior notice should be supported . #% Madam President , I will be brief and make just two points . #% I have some reservations regarding on-board diagnostics and in-service testing . #% But the whole of Parliament agreed this was very hard to define as even , for example , when one is pouring a large motorway bridge or laying a large floor , there is a certain amount of manual work involved in grouting or finishing . #% Supporters of this appeal will be invited to come together to agree upon their plans to campaign for the condemnation of violent and illegal actions by individual states and to establish the sovereignty of the UN framework . #% A number of political groups and parties within this Parliament will decide how they vote on the eleventh plenary and its siting . #% So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States . #% For a disabled person it means the freedom to travel or the restriction to stay at home . #% Calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet . #% People are entitled to their own private views , but at an institutional and legal level , we can not compromise on the principle that we are all equal . #% Mr President , I too wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Barthet-Mayer on her excellent report and in particular on her work in drafting compromise amendments to take on board the many additional amendments submitted to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% They do not have the proper mindset for discussing legal immigration . #% By the end of this century , considerable economic power may have shifted to states with undemocratic governments . #% The Commission also claims a virtuous circle in terms of the economy for three reasons : the favourable monetary conditions , strengthened internal demand and improved confidence . #% We also support the need for an on-going review of the situation to ensure progress does not give rise to social or economic problems . #% That is why it is an accession issue . #% But in spite of this progress , many specific problems still have to be overcome in Bulgaria . #% I applauded because I have wanted reform in this sector ever since I read the 1991 report by the Court of Auditors . #% However , there were certain questions that we had to raise . #% We have done that , taking into account the views of the Committee on Petitions ' rapporteur for the 1999 budget , Barbara Schmidbauer . #% 
I maintain that the guardian of the people of the European Union is the Parliament . #% How can this be extended to countries which are not even candidates yet ? #% Member States can adopt tougher legislation . #% The Commissioner knows that full well and I have raised the issue of discards in general with him several times . #% With regard to Belarus , I have been a staunch critic in the past of the Lukashenko dictatorship . #% The Council , in its wisdom , decided to ignore both the wishes of the Commission and of Parliament and has put in the common position a recommendation for a III ( b ) committee . #% Please do not forget , you important people who have spacious offices - even the secretaries-general of the political groups have office space four times that of a backbench MEP - that when you have an assistant and a stagiaire crammed into one office , you have no place in which to meet visitors . #% There are so many things that are important for those particular workers but one of the key things for this is recapable needles . #% I want the report to be a success . #% I want to look simply at budgetary matters . #% Meanwhile , a few miles up the road , the King Baudouin stadium , Belgium 's national stadium , and now probably one of the safest stadia in all of Europe , will lie empty that day . #% Therefore , we could end up being protective of our biofuel industry and replacing one form of agricultural policy with another one . #% I am sure that the Commissioner can appreciate the need to be practical . #% Some claim to see in the Charter of Fundamental Rights -- which will become legally binding -- a threat . #% I do not want the President-in-Office to think that I am alarmist but the reality is that the EU has only two weeks to prepare an appropriate response which can ensure that the essential elements of the trade components of the negotiations are concluded and ready for discussion in Coreper the following week . #% Those measures must be implemented in respect of all non-EU sources of steel in the form of quotas based on 1998 import levels if we are to do a proper job in protecting our own industry . #% As Mr Harbour says , the role and activity of the Secretary-General in all of these activities and indeed in many others is crucial . #% In the last Parliament we wanted to make sure that we had proper functioning interinstitutional cooperation . #% From what I hear , however , liberalisation in Spain has led to a number of broken connections , with blackouts occurring in Madrid and in other areas . #% The ratification process for the Constitution is underway , the Lisbon process is not yet making enough progress and the future of transatlantic relations is a source of concern . #% I also commend the comments about the importance of having proper healthcare for elderly people such as myself . #% We must get the best possible value for money from these other institutions and ask them to re-examine their budget spending . #% That is the task of both our rapporteurs , certainly Mr Stenmarck , who will look at the other institutions to see what money there is left over in their budgets to be put into the pot to ensure that the Commission is not disadvantaged to any great extent . #% I note also that in January 2002 the Directorate-General for Enterprises started to work on benchmarking the administration of business start-ups . #% Mr President , I do not doubt that is what the President 's notes say , but one of the problems with accepting it is that my notes and those of other Members and of the general rapporteur say differently . #% Only two weeks ago the Russian courts handed down a lenient sentence to one of its executives convicted of tax evasion : hardly the signs of judicial bias . #% While the Commission correctly states that the accession process for Bulgaria is based on the ` own merits ' principle , nevertheless it has also said that it is committed to a common accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania together , by the end of 2005 . #% I am very pleased to support most of what the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment has said , although I have some trepidation in doing so being conscious that the next ECJ fine may well be against the UK for its failure to comply with the bathing water directive , despite the fact that a great deal of money has been spent and effort made in recent years to reach such compliance . #% I am very glad to hear that these rules are not cast in stone and could be changed . #% I can not therefore vote for enlargement because to do so is to accept Annex XV within the Treaty and that is impossible for me . #% Indeed , in a number of countries the local government system , let alone the parliamentary system , would probably collapse without their input . #% I do not think we need that for cross-border trade ; there is no necessity there . #% My purpose this afternoon is to intervene briefly on the question of the relocation of employment within the European Community , the subject of Mrs Hautala 's report . #% We may put that right tomorrow , but why , Commissioner Byrne , is it that there is no cost impact assessment on small businesses in this directive ? #% May I remind you that the provisions which would apply to Members of the Parliament are , to quote the text itself , `` without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaties and in particular the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities '' . #% When the last generation saw Nelson Mandela labelled a terrorist , when former East Germans smuggled themselves across the Berlin Wall , when the Holocaust represented one of the worst ethnic genocides in world history , the threats of terrorism , trafficking and racial hatred were a cue to agree human rights , not to tear them down . #% Mr President , I also very much welcome Mr Berman 's report and thank him for the work he has put into it . #% I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said . #% The Council recommended that only five new staff be granted and various positions have been taken on the additional staff requested and the money for them . #% Pressure on Russia and Ukraine would help solve this matter . #% My report is in effect a final report on the performance of the last government and an indicator as to the problems that need to be addressed by the new administration . #% I also want to make sure that we actually condemn hooligans in a very strong way in this House ; all hooligans whatever country they come from and whatever their background . #% We are all in development mode and our commitment must be to drive our policy forward and faster . #% We therefore welcomed many aspects of the resolution , not least the concern expressed at the lack of action over Zimbabwe . #% We have to have better information networks , we have to have this exchange of information horizontally , not coming into the centre and going out again . #% I do not need to quote the Koran to you to remind you that men and women were equal in the Koran from the very start of Islam ; it can not be because of that . #% We can be sure we will have the necessary number of Members present and we can make sure that any further confusion is eliminated by the time of the final vote . #% There is no way forward other than for all 15 Member States to have a similar policy with guidelines that are not just similar but the same , and which are recognised and enforced by all Member States . #% There is no provision for the Council to respond formally to our recommendations and , while the Commission can make recommendations to the policy and planning unit , Parliament can not . #% We have to ensure that beyond the achievement of inflation control at a low level monetary policy can make its contribution towards fighting unemployment . #% We are working in a crowded market , colleagues . #% Either through poor administration or delayed planning of what should happen and what should be approved by the European authorities , and perhaps in conjunction with the national authorities , we are behind on spending on structural funding both for inner-cities and rural areas . #% But , on the other hand , it is rather an unfocused debate . #% And now the Commission 's action plan suggests how we can finish the job and move into the ` super league ' of job creation . #% For the last 27 years it seems we have failed to check whether we have been spending European taxpayers ' money properly . #% Some other countries can not say the same . #% Assurances on the issue were sought from the relevant Member States in February 1995 and , when they were not forthcoming , the Commission initiated proceedings based on Article 169 of the Treaty in June of that year . #% I will certainly press my own government to go further on this . #% My point is one that was raised with me by a minister in Ljubljana . #% In order to establish competitive sugar production in the EU there must be cross-border quota transfers to allow more efficient areas of the EU to be ... #% It has been a very long road . #% My questions are actually directed to Mr Bolkestein , and I hope you will allow him to answer them , as the issue is about how well the European rolling stock market is really operating and whether public procurement rules really are operating successfully ... #% I am very happy to accept the suggestion to change the word ` defiling ' to ` defamation ' . #% We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life . #% Madam President , it is all very well Mr Poos saying that the Quaestors asked for the air quality check . #% It is also clearly crucial the ECB should look only at the euro zone as a whole in terms of its inflation and price stability objective . #% 
We also rejoice that these nations are members of the NATO alliance , the most successful defence organisation the world has ever seen . #% The CFR and the review of the can make a huge contribution to the better functioning of the internal market . #% One of the groups named in the report is an organization called Operation Mobilization , the headquarters of which are in Shropshire , which is part of my constituency . #% The central issue here is about how the European Union functions and , more particularly within your area , about how the internal market functions . #% We have succeeded in persuading the agencies to do this , but the work programmes are costed and we can see horizontally through Title I , Title II and Title III expenditure of the agencies ' report , what each project is going to cost . #% Yes , Mr Pirker , I am looking at the same report as you . #% The deadline for the tabling of amendments was yesterday evening at 19.00 . #% I deprecate the sanctimonious twaddle of Mr Watson , representing the Liberals . #% It is now vital for the European economy as a whole that any instability does not damage trade and the wider European economy . #% We also welcome the Commission 's new stress on coordination rather than on legislation . #% Parliament will be informed of this consolidation as soon as it is complete . #% Real solutions , therefore , lie in the hands of politicians coordinating their actions at government level . #% The creation of false forms of independence and self-employment can put workers who are in an employment situation beyond the framework of protection . #% I do , however , disagree with the reports when they call for a Treaty clause on sport . #% It is significant that the EU will now support the commemoration of the victims of both those dictatorships . #% This instrument , if transformed into a directive , would mean that we are able to see through the European Commission and through the Members of Parliament whether anybody is actually doing anything . #% We understand the reasons but we also seek to abide by the letter and spirit of the law of the European Union . #% What concerns me about this report is words like ` pricing policy ' and ` tax on fossil fuels ' , because no current serious alternatives exist and these taxes are very inflationary . #% People in such circumstances have to worry about the next 25 minutes rather than the next 25 years . #% Mr President , having listened to the debate yesterday on this subject , I decided I had to say something about the bizarre concept of democracy that some Members in this place and the Commission have . #% If this has to be done on a regular basis , I contend that there is a problem with the basic wage paid , rather than the right to continue compulsory overtime . #% But this Parliament should not sign up to any agreement at all . #% However , we need to ensure that measures we propose are both sensible and practical . #% They signed a voluntary agreement with the Commission , with the European Union . #% I especially welcome the committee 's decision to lower the thresholds involved . #% In signing the Constitutional Treaty he accepted that the Council should meet in public when it deliberates upon legislative acts . #% I simply ask for a factual examination of what has been achieved . #% The Council might want to argue about that , but we do not see any argument . #% I welcome the President-in-Office 's speech , which boils down to three points . #% That timetable , which would culminate in a parliamentary vote at the beginning of the next plenary , would allow us to have time for discussions with the Council and with the Budgets Committee so that we could honour our side of the bargain by releasing the ECU 30 million that could be immediately spent in Bosnia . #% However , I was pleased that , in this case , the proposal seems to be less controversial . #% I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status ; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field . #% But of course , in itself , that is insufficient to avoid fraud and misfeasance . #% There are other darker forces waiting in the wings of this conflict . #% Given that the answer was basically ` wait until tomorrow ' , it is difficult to ask a supplementary . #% Their average life expectancy is 50 years . #% The UK response has been the adoption of shoot-to-kill policies on the basis of guidance from the security forces in the war on terror , which has seen an innocent man killed in my own country and another lucky to be alive . #% Increasingly , the peoples of Europe are saying ` Let us go in the opposite direction ' . #% That is why I called in my report for a definition of disability . #% I do not have the time to go through all the recommendations made in the report , but I will list some of the measures which should be given priority : the continuation of start-up grants of up to EUR 40 000 , in combination with subsidised interest rates for start-up capital of up to EUR 120 000 for eight years . #% Would it not be much better for them to be able to go and buy cars in Holland and sell them to consumers there , rather than have what could be a random solution which would actually dissipate the impact of the dealers ' independence that he wants to give them ? #% Or the case of a dental nurse working in a prison who was pricked by a needle that was used on an inmate who had hepatitis A , B , and C and was HIV positive . #% How , when we have this debate about concerns over the criminal sanctions , do we intend to reconcile the two different negotiations between the civil and the criminal chapter ? #% I hope the House will support it in the vote . #% The coordinators and the rapporteur are working very hard to try to ensure that we can get a position which will deliver a qualified majority on Thursday because if we do not , we may end up with the Council 's position which would not aid the Commission 's reform process as we would want it to do . #% Mr Van Velzen is absolutely right that we need to create a clear and predictable licensing environment and of course he is right to say that there should be clear time limits . #% It would be a retrograde step . #% I hope that Member State governments like my own , which think it is safe for asylum-seekers to be returned to Zimbabwe , will take note of the resolution tabled here this afternoon and revise their position . #% According to the Accession Treaty , Bulgaria will accede on 1 January 2007 unless the Council unanimously decides , on a Commission recommendation , to postpone entry for one year . #% I am pleased to say that the committee shared my view and therefore we have substantially improved it in committee . #% It can not initiate legislation and it can not repeal legislation . #% E-commerce , of all types , still lags behind in Europe . #% Taking those things into consideration , we have actually come up with a consistent policy . #% There are other issues that were examined in this resolution which should be more properly dealt with in the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to revise the Treaties . #% Someone in the sessional services has removed it without any reference back to those of us who signed it . #% It is surely a breach of EU law , which requires nondiscrimination on the grounds of nationality . #% The Interinstitutional Agreement states that any needs for enlargement will be met through a revision of the financial perspective . #% Now , there has been much speculation in the European Parliament as to who might be the model for Irina Vega , with our rapporteur being the most widely mentioned . #% Indeed I was also at the Geneva Summit and was able to follow the project through . #% It is said that one of the three great lies in the language is the phrase : ' I am a lawyer and I am here to help you ' . #% You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called `` core tasks '' . #% We have had in East Germany the assassination of a Mozambique man , attacks on migrant workers in Spain , an attack on a Jewish professor in Italy , and the continued rise of racism within football that was presented to us yesterday by those people who are campaigning around the '' Show racism the red card '' slogan . #% All conclude that up to 2 000 lives a year could be saved and 20 000 serious injury accidents could also be prevented if this new directive to make cars safer when involved in collisions with pedestrians and pedal cyclists becomes law . #% I suspect that made a hell of a din . #% All today 's statement represents is a victory for the political classes , the classes in the European Union who want this to be a world superpower to take on the United States of America , and of course a huge victory for the politicians in Romania and Bulgaria , who will enrich themselves enormously and give themselves jobs in perpetuity . #% This has been emphasised by the Union under the Copenhagen criteria and the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% 
Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this . #% The way that this should be done - and my views are very close to those of the Commission - is to have a first-year wide-open debate - let a thousand flowers bloom - then move to a broad , deliberative body that will draft the changes that are necessary . #% I am still amazed that the situation is allowed to continue . #% Throughout the period of the Financial Perspective to 2006 the costs of the administration as a proportion of GNP will be lower than they were in 1985 . #% I think it is due to two rather simple things . #% How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ? #% First , I hope the House will reject the amendments , tabled by some PPE-DE colleagues , to delete all the references to reproductive health rights . #% After 45 years , changes will not come quickly . #% I welcome that the victims of crime will be guaranteed legal aid in order to get compensation . #% I regret that he found this particular problem . #% What business is it of this House to tell a builder that he must use scaffolding to refix a roof tile ? #% I ask all Members in this House to support the amendments put forward by the PPE-DE Group in order to establish a common sense approach to stamping out LPAI in the European Union and maintain full public and consumer support for the industry . #% We did not take action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and global warming as fast as we could , because we all wanted to drive around in cooler cars in the summer . #% -- Mr President , I want to give an explanation of vote on the Commission 's legislative work programme . #% Phthalates have never done any harm to anyone , yet we are banning them . #% We need strict enforcement of legislation on combating money laundering and on the freezing of terrorist assets , and the ratifying of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters concerning the monitoring of bank accounts . #% At what level will the European Union be represented in order that we can have a clear and ambitious action plan ? #% We want , if I can use the phrase , to see disability . #% I will finish very quickly with an anecdote that would be funny if were it not so serious . #% This recommendation means that the smaller the club , the smaller the amount of money the club will receive in compensation for training costs . #% On this , I accept my country 's responsibility . #% Nowhere is this better highlighted than in the current delays , obfuscation and confusion in the United Kingdom over where to put this valuable money . #% It seemed to me that the officials were very keen to know more about Parliament . #% The Commissioner has explained to us that there has been quite intense work , with high-level meetings with interior ministers , visits to capitals , encouragement to run information campaigns - and there is a specific commitment by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania to inform their citizens . #% We must also destigmatise people with mental health problems . #% This has led to a spotlight on the two remaining states -- Ireland and the United Kingdom -- and to hysterical press reactions about being swamped by benefit tourists . #% I am sorry that I have to keep bringing this up , but I just can not understand why it is that the European Commission is so intent on imposing on Europe a proprietary metal made by a Finnish company , known as Outokumpu . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report . #% And would he agree with me that there should be a reduction in patent protection , reinforced health safeguards and a ban on the threatened use of trade sanctions ? #% We still have the problem of considerable sympathy for Islamic terrorism in neighbouring Iran , where some al-Qa ` ida fighters have allegedly taken refuge , but almost certainly many are sheltering in Pakistan , where president Musharraf walks a tightrope between cooperating with the West and yet not fully cracking down on his home-grown Jihadi Islamic terrorist groups despite pledging to do so . #% The Council said that we boast a long tradition in Europe on human rights , but it must be recognised that sometimes we hesitate in condemning the human rights abuses carried out by our so-called friendly states . #% The general conclusions are clear . #% There is nothing to fear and there is everything for the staff , the institutions and the public interest to gain by the modernisation of the career structure of the European Union institutions from the inherited structure which is over 40 years old . #% To sum up , I would urge Parliament to move to a rapid conclusion on my report so that we can turn our full attention to the much-needed simplification and modernisation of the whole of Regulation 1408/71 to make it more inclusive and effective for all of those covered by a social security scheme . #% So far as Miss Kadeer is concerned , obviously I did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond . #% A promise of funding had been made by the EU and that promise had to be kept . #% Surely one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected so soundly in Holland and France was because people do not understand what a political union is . #% In addition , a very senior , recently retired , civil servant , submitted evidence to Ms McCarthy . #% He should be putting it to the British Government . #% I am confident that the proposals I put before you tonight are balanced and will stand the test of time . #% It is not in any way a secret . #% However , in Romania , Minister Monica Macovei , backed up by her Prime Minister and her President against considerable opposition within the system itself , has made dramatic steps . #% The space to think . #% However , you can only ever be as effective as the Member States will allow you to be and , of course , you are reluctant to use your own powers of initiative - an approach which I fully support . #% We have recognised that this directive will enter into force in a period when we are enlarging the Union and a whole series of standards and objectives that we previously had in the group of 15 will now have to be extended to 25 Member States . #% Approximately 3 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources . #% Any self-respecting Parliament would now vote no confidence in the ... #% When I congratulated her on this , she looked rather guilty and admitted that the green bottle now contained normal detergent , as the alternative product was not only more expensive but needed four times as much and even then it did not get the dishes clean ; by refilling the container , she could both do the washing up effectively and impress eco-warrior friends . #% Mr President , you fought against the Soviet Union . #% First , the lack of an action plan . #% in writing . - Conservatives have been consistent advocates of a strong non-proliferation regime and a multilateral approach toward nuclear-weapon reduction , firmly opposing any proposals aimed at unilateral nuclear disarmament . #% I hope that the letter that will be sent to the Info-Points will contain an apology . #% Let me turn to some of the issues . #% Unless you demonstrate greater foresight and communicate fully with your EU partners we will not be able to work together and help European industry to face the challenge of these emerging markets . #% Unfortunately there is a printing error and the names of the British Conservatives who voted this way are not obvious . #% We can not close our eyes and minds to the problems of small countries thousands of kilometres away or impoverished and troubled regions - whether or not we agree with the regimes there - and just think that they do not matter . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I welcome and support this proposal . #% 40 per cent of freight already goes by sea . #% Mr President , every year arms kill hundreds of thousands of people and cause immeasurable human suffering . #% Of course I support the principle behind the initiative we are discussing this evening . #% I believe that it has to be the task of this Parliament to be in favour of simpler rules and procedures and also to ensure that we have an understanding of the need for timely and effective decision-making in programming . #% The European Union countries not in ` euroland ' will have a compensation formula until the year 2002 - for the next three years . #% The Environment Committee has also asked for 50 % of the budget for the European Food Safety Authority to be put into the reserve . #% I will certainly fight to make sure it is the last . #% This is not evidence of a slothful or lax Commission , but neither does it mean that we imagine that the sky is permanently blue , nor do these glasses have any rose tint . #% I want to know whether or not you will be looking - and you did indicate this in your speech - at strengthening phytosanitary measures so that we can have healthy , safe food within the United Kingdom and within Europe . #% 
It is not that we are insensitive to those arguments , but that we place them in a context of what is the stronger and the greater good . #% This budget needs to change direction . #% Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino . #% If we can encourage the Commissioner to highlight this and to protest when he sees national governments act in this way , he will certainly have our wholehearted support and mine in particular . #% If competencies were indeed to be restored to the nation state , the UK Independence Party might be persuaded to support the Commission . #% Does Mr Solana agree with me that what we need primarily is a European defence review to assess our capacities ? #% If they do , let it be on their consciences that they voted against EUR 20 million per year for health , while endorsing an annual budget of over EUR 1 000 million for subsidising the growing of tobacco . #% The real worry is not particularly with food-chain animals . #% To that extent , the PKK are seen as freedom fighters . #% First of all it distorts the very nature of sport . #% It requires only that operators at one particular point in the supply chain put in place a due-diligence system while everyone else is immune from any obligation as to the legality of the timber or the timber products that they trade . #% When I hear remarks like those from UKIP , it worries me . #% I met a Professor Nusseibeh two weeks ago in Brussels and he is clearly an example of the type of Palestinian who is acting in good faith and is prepared to make compromises , including over the vexed issue of the right of return and the final status of Jerusalem . #% It can only be beneficial to involve the public in that battle , not to do it behind the scenes in the complex way you describe . #% Independently , UK Conservative MEPs had come to the identical conclusion . #% However , I recognise that it is part of a wider compromise that was achieved in the IGC . #% Mr President , even though the Christian Democrats are late converts to the idea of a Committee of Experts which they opposed in January , we in the Socialist Group welcome the fact that they now support the establishment of the Committee of Experts and we look forward to its second report which will be published within the next couple of months . #% A number of different concerns have been raised by colleagues , of a political nature : the lack of US participation in the Kyoto Protocol , the biodiversity convention , the Ottawa Convention on land mines and , recently , the refusal to sign the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , it seems such a calm conclusion to such a tempestuous debate . #% My question to the Commissioner is really will she consider - and I am only asking her to consider , not to commit herself - saying a final goodbye , rather than au revoir , to this directive ? #% At present , spectrum is managed on an administrative command and control model whereby certain frequencies are allocated to certain specific uses . #% For too long the human rights and democracy clauses in the EU 's international agreements have committed us to the finest ideals , but they have not been subject to monitoring , reporting and systematic dialogue between the parties . #% Mr President , I would like to add my thanks to Louise McVay , to the rapporteur , and also to my two colleagues from the region , Mr Helmer who is here today and will be speaking later on , and to Mr Heaton Harris who also followed this matter very closely . #% I am pleased that at least some of our suggestions have already been incorporated . #% Mr President , first of all I would be grateful if Commissioner Diamantopoulou would convey to Commissioner de Palacio my personal thanks for the work that I know the Commissioner has already undertaken in this regard . #% Sadly , an inability to do this is often a feature of the relationship between parliaments and governments in developing countries . #% Encumbering the European Union with defence responsibilities will do little to encourage it to make more effective use of its valuable non-military crisis-management instruments , which could genuinely complement the military forces of NATO . #% Secondly , I want to urge the Turkish government to take an initiative towards a political settlement with the Kurds . #% There has to be a willingness to integrate and to adopt family practices and other social attitudes that give confidence to the wider Bulgarian population . #% Equally , there is a clear failure by Member States to implement a whole range of directives , whether it is waste oil , sewage sludge or toxic and dangerous waste . #% More and more commercial transactions are being conducted by electronic commerce and the Internet particularly facilitates cross-border transactions . #% It sounds to me as if HELIOS II is going to come to an end , the Commission is going to think about what it might do in the future and then it hopes the issue will disappear . #% But the legal advice given to the EU institutions was that a contracting party to the Rome Statute that concludes bilateral agreements outside the tight scope of Article 98 acts against the object and purpose of the Statute . #% The letter sent by Secretary Clinton to President Buzek , raising concerns regarding SWIFT , was woefully late in the day . #% Those jobs are our jobs - Europe 's jobs - and our businesses . #% But what this Parliament and the Community institutions and international bodies should not do is attempt to legislate for national parliaments in areas which are national competences , and in my view any attempt to do so should be resisted strongly as a matter of overriding constitutional principle . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group warmly welcomes the content of Mr Schlyter 's report , which is to be commended for its sensitive , yet highly practical , approach . #% For example , I have been doing work recently which has brought me into contact with people who are producing computer games and interactive computer games and the scale of that multibillion dollar , global business is producing enormous new opportunities for creators in every field , whether in illustration , music composition or script production . #% I simply do not know how he managed to keep a straight face as he read out those comments . #% Credit should be given to his efforts . #% It would not be acceptable to have direct links with a regime that is not recognised . #% How on earth do you justify the fact that in instigating proceedings today you are also effectively sending a signal to the French that they still have another two weeks to take a decision on this matter ? #% I think we all want to see the human rights situation improved . #% Firstly , the importance of international partnerships and particularly the most successful partnership of them all , the European Union . #% This new era is one that belongs to the innovative , those with relevant knowledge and those who are able to recognise changing world climates and adapt accordingly . #% We also warmly welcome the requirement for the national authorities to accept greater accountability for the money they spend . #% Last week , I visited an exhibition in my constituency at home with an exhibition of paintings and photographs of women who had been trafficked from a country next to our Union - Moldova - into our Union . #% There have been many , other often low-level , gestures of rapprochement between Greek and Turkish people in recent weeks . #% Would not the Council agree that the Helms/Burton Act , which opposes Cuba 's admission to the World Bank , the IMF and the OAS until there is a post-Castro government , is very much an infringement of Cuba 's sovereignty ? #% The European Parliament must maintain its commitments to existing bodies when redefining budgetary priorities . #% Time and time again we hear people telling us that military action is the answer , that it will be a quick military action and that once it is over everything will be sorted out . #% Just as it was right to bring in the minimum wage to combat the problem of poverty pay , it is now time to call time on excessive working hours , which see workers bullied and exploited , fuel stress and other health problems , and which damage family life . #% They are weeks without meetings but they are weeks when the Commission , the Council and all other agents of this Parliament , including the political groups , are hard at work . #% We have heard that this is an important sector , not least in terms of the employment opportunities outlined so ably by Mr Hughes . #% I believe there is much that we can do to hasten its progress and thus provide jobs . #% We are well aware of the importance of that and I know Commissioner Byrne , is equally aware of it . #% Stage two as proposed by Mr de Roo will be more expensive and it needs to be carefully costed before we go forward with that . #% I believe it has a place here . #% Could you also answer one or two other questions ? #% Today we can safely say that the iron curtain has not only been lifted but has been dismantled , packed up in its box and consigned to the attic of history where it will serve to remind us of the horrors of the past . #% Mr President , I should like to offer my congratulations to the two rapporteurs on an enormously complicated and difficult task . #% We must give it every assistance to achieve this ambition . #% Manufacturers say that if this amendment goes through , they will no longer be able to manufacture these goods . #% BSE and CJD have been a nightmare for Europe for some years . #% I am sure there are other people in this building who also have asthma and other lung problems , so I request that all `` no smoking '' areas are respected . #% But that does not detract from our enormous support for this and for a United Nations convention for disabled people . #% 
The second question , which is the one we have to decide here , is whether we should prevent Mr Le Pen being able , and indeed being forced under German law , to give an account of what he said and what he did before a German court . #% Specifically , however , I would like to point out how much I welcome the Commission 's cooperation in providing information and updates at regular intervals . #% I would point out that many victims are those who live in poverty or are immigrants or from minority groups within our populations . #% Madam President , in my view the British Government is making itself look very silly in the present circumstances . #% Views differ , however , as to whether that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure . #% The question concerns the specific immigration status of a specific Kosovan refugee and the failure to provide visas for him from embassies in other EU states . #% We have a Pact for Stability and Growth and we will accept the strict application of that pact but no further measures to place the economies of the European Union in a straitjacket . #% Furthermore , I do not agree that security and defence issues should come under the authority of a Commissioner or that a White Paper on defence should be drawn up by the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit for approval by the European Council . #% Many of us have fought hard to build links and create solidarity between Europe and Latin America as a whole and the casual postponement of this accord could be very damaging . #% Since joining the EU , the United Kingdom , the world 's fifth largest economy , does not have the autonomy to determine trade policy even with a Commonwealth country . #% This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure , which allows for no amendments to the report . #% Mr President , with the prospect of more people moving around the European Union more freely , my Group and I welcome the harmonisation of driving licences . #% We do not agree that , in order to live in harmony , there is any need to vest powers in a central authority which transcends the nation-state - which we regard as the bedrock of democracy . #% I am in favour of social protection , I am in favour of the original Commission document , but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high . #% In this case it is particularly important because it is a federal execution and will be the first since 1963 . #% Questions of confidentiality , slander or libel are always relevant . #% We are disappointed that the report does not support the cross border quota transfer within the EU which would allow sugar producers in Europe to become more efficient and competitive . #% For instance , Belgium and the UK bar diabetics from being police officers , but Hungary and Portugal do not . #% At our first reading in Strasbourg last October , Parliament voted amendments which I felt would improve the quality of the text , and I announced some of the irregularities and flaws to which I alluded a moment ago . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the European Council took important decisions about the future management of crises , but I agree with President Barroso that the underlying problems remain : the need to return to fiscal discipline and the reluctance by some Member States to pursue seriously economic reform . #% We need to have respect for parliamentary procedures in relation to these new forms of open coordination . #% My own assistant just popped over to Stockholm this weekend for an engagement party -- not even a wedding , just an engagement party . #% The reason for that , simply , is that we do not believe that the proposal should be watered down in the way that the rapporteur has proposed . #% Mr President , yesterday I was in this House addressing the issue of the European Aviation Safety Agency when I noted that the means by which it was being achieved was through the gradual integration of the national systems . #% The Commission , in my view , is to be congratulated on its efforts to persuade Member States to give up their bilateral agreements and to allow the Commission to negotiate for the Community as a whole . #% The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel . #% We need a few other safeguards to protect people from the hazards of modern living . #% It is easy to understand why . #% This is one of the very few proposals I can recall which has come with a price tag attached . #% Without that , enlargement will be a hazardous exercise and risks bringing us to paralysis . #% That is not the focus of our discussion now . #% We are talking about a binding agreement with the ACP , and I trust that the Council will reflect that in the decisions it takes on the tenth EDF . #% There has been not one individual vote in any committee on any Commissioner , not one Commissioner has been forced to withdraw as a result of the questions as to his suitability and not one Commissioner has accepted any sort of responsibility for the events of the past . #% No number of impact assessments or re-impact assessments should replace democracy . #% What is all the fuss about ?! ' #% Many more minority sports are now broadcast because the private sector is there . #% I must confess , I can not blame them . #% To suspend funding is to undermine the very political and judicial reforms which the EU has been supporting ; to suspend funding is to drive people into the arms of extremists and into the arms of Iran in particular , with risks of much greater fundamentalist influence . #% The country-of-origin principle is simply the best agreed way of approaching the process of harmonising the standards for attaining an EU-wide application of the guidance for those standards which are to be expected in those nations . #% But in the real world it is probably as good as one can hope to get . #% I share the rapporteur 's views in paragraph 6 about the absence of any review of those famous task forces on which we spent so much committee time . #% Mr President , the British Conservatives support the thrust of this directive . #% If it does not , should it not have such powers ? #% Invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic . #% I would like to know first of all how far you feel that management culture is now being developed by your new top team and how far that is starting to be communicated through the Commission ' s organisation . #% Small businesses for certain . #% We need to know how the Commission , via the recast , will facilitate the full implementation of the full railway package . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled ` Kashmir : present situation and future prospects ' . #% However , it also calls for Jesuitical schools propaganda and using British taxpayers ' money to support the ratification process . #% Mr President , would you please ensure that a letter is written to the Ethiopian Government to urge it to respect that decision , in order to restore peace between the two countries after what has been a bloody and terrible war . #% This directive will not guarantee that there will be no more blackouts : that would be impossible . #% But the other major fault of the CAP is that it is an agricultural policy . #% It welcomes the tightening up of provisions concerning the transfer of fishing vessels to third countries . #% The net result of all that is that the actual annual price that we will pay of EUR 31.9 million per annum , at an interest rate that we negotiated in recent months , will be lower than the cost anticipated when the protocol , the memorandum of understanding , was signed between the Commission and the Belgian Government in 1997 . #% She is the coordinator for our group on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee and , in her general enthusiasm , she is like a one-woman Congress of Berlin . #% Protection of this resource , therefore , is essential to allow for both the capacity of such resources to recover as well as for nitrates and other chemicals to be excluded as far as possible from reaching the UK 's drinking water . #% Change is necessary as regards the size of this Parliament if we are to respect the limit of 700 members laid down in the Treaties at our own request . #% Sustainable development is going to be very important in the context of enlargement . #% What do we have on the table today ? #% We should do everything as a Parliament to support the process of post-conflict reconciliation and democratic transformation . #% First , the introduction of health impact assessments for all major EU transport projects and policies is probably the single most important initiative which could help integrate transport and health policies and help to minimise the negative impact of transport on health . #% Students have already been mentioned but we must not ignore the business community or professional associations . #% I want to say why we feel this confidence at this stage . #% The proliferation of Deobandi madrasahs , preaching messages of hatred against the West , has created an environment in which extremism and fundamentalism flourish and too many EU citizens - including from my own country , the UK - have gone through their clutches . #% If animal feed is safe , then consumers feel safe when eating animal products . #% If she thinks the Budgets Committee is superior to the House I suggest she go back to constitutional school . #% 
This House has a responsibility - and I say this to all the political groups represented here this afternoon . #% Now it is the turn of education , broadly speaking . #% Thank you , Mr Prodi . #% Given that it will be dissolved at midnight on 1 July - or one minute past midnight on 1 July - then these elections should be held this year and not next year as some in Hong Kong have claimed . #% Let us remember that 12 years ago Iraq was given 15 days to disarm . #% We need the Commission to come forward with a shark management action plan . #% I wish to comment on one aspect of this : the reinvigoration of the transatlantic alliance . #% It would bring about rumours and feelings of uncertainty among consumers , as a substance that has been approved safe by an independent scientific committee is being questioned again for absolutely no good reason . #% I fear that today defence is too serious a business to be left to politicians . #% We also welcome the Commission 's proposal for a further progress report six months before accession . #% I should like to thank Mrs Wallström for outlining to us what the Commission ' s action is going to be . #% Commissioner , would you subscribe to the view that this is something that the Commission should do in order to try to deal with this crisis , which is what this evening 's debate is all about ? #% That paragraph is tabled individually as an amendment . #% The failure of the CFSP is our fault . #% I recently visited one of those sites in the United Kingdom . #% Strengthened international coordination will assist the fight against pornography on the Internet and protect consumers taking advantage of the electronic marketplace against credit card fraud . #% As for the proposals on immigration and asylum , I was the minister in the UK until 1997 dealing with these issues . #% All in all , although it has been long , it has been well worthwhile . #% I am very keen to help reassure Mr Rübig that good deals across the Channel are , in fact , available to all citizens of the European Union . #% However , our commitment to try is there within Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 and in the spirit of those people who have worked to make access a reality . #% Mr President , I am pleased that we are debating this resolution today even though I would have preferred the ELDR resolution to have been the one we are debating . #% The process of modernisation that has been taking place in Turkey over the past 70 years has been massively accelerated and additional attention is now being given to human rights issues and to overcoming historic grievances . #% I was there as a UN observer . #% I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking . #% Mr President , I yield to no one in my desire for peace in Sir Lanka and in my condemnation of all violence . #% That justification is self-evident for Alzheimer 's and now that the eight initial programmes are under way , if far from in place , it is appropriate to turn towards the future . #% From the Socialist Group 's point of view we will be supporting most of the amendments tabled . #% I think that is an unbelievable intrusion into the democratic and sovereign right of other countries to have a penal system that suits them and their citizens rather than the European Union . #% Why is it that security can not be established ? #% By allowing illegal immigrants to stay in a Member State , although ostensibly for prosecution purposes , the directive would leave the asylum system open to abuse . #% For women Afghanistan is becoming , yet again , the land of their deepest sorrow and suffering . #% The third factor , and probably the most important one , is the attitude of the Council . #% The authorities need to take action and not take it out on other innocent parties . #% The Commissioner mentioned this very briefly . #% For example , there is one of our local authority areas that has 26 inhabited islands and a coastline as long as that of France . #% At the moment we have 15 national foreign policies . #% But reading between the lines , as one should , it is fairly clear that not much progress is being made to reform the Council . #% The issue that has , of course , taken most of the committee ' s time and attention has been the fact that this proposal for a regulation has coincided with the growth of e-commerce which in itself offers enormous opportunities to business and consumers within the internal market . #% I was in Cuba recently with colleagues on an ad hoc delegation . #% The ability of consumers , confusing as it can be , to pick such technologies , to choose a variety of financial services within the individual Member States , has been with us now for some little time . #% Following that , there has been a systematic attempt to destabilise the new government led by elements of the former governing party and extreme nationalist gangs under the flimsy pretext of protecting indigenous interests . #% While she has the requisite power and influence , she should make that commitment . #% I agree with her emphasis on the political nature of this problem and welcome her call for us to take a leading role . #% The problem is that at the moment the peace agreement is holding in Monrovia , but less well outside . #% Frankly it is not acceptable for the President of the Commission to come here and only talk about the situation in Russia . #% Seeing that the own-resources decision is likely to need national ratification , could not a few extra clauses that would save the European taxpayer an enormous amount of money be added at the same time ? #% Fidel Castro must learn to respect human rights and introduce democracy . #% When it does so , what offer will the current Member States give to Croatia as regards the number of votes Croatia will have in the Council ? #% in writing . - I voted for this resolution particularly because of the demand contained within it for a review of the effectiveness and fairness of Regulation ( EC ) No 1546/2006 ( introduction of liquids onto aircraft ) . #% A number of us would like to vote for her amendment but , because of what has gone on in the coordinators ' meetings , we have no idea how to do so . #% I understand the desire of my colleague , Mr de Roo , to take the standards further . #% The future of the world is at stake . #% Those things are anathema to Socialists , but vital for all of us . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming Mrs Schreyer , speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen , and thank her very much for taking the opportunity to report back to us so soon on the Geneva Summit . #% Some nominees , such as László Andor , demonstrated little understanding of their portfolios and seemed inclined to impose more and more unhelpful regulation . #% It was being sold at something like ECU 2 , 000 per tonne . #% We must also recognise that the EU does not have legal competence over national governments ' own negotiations with third parties . #% I must say to Mrs Van Lancker that the social debate in the United Kingdom is not entirely dead . #% The second issue we have to address is that there should be no undercutting . #% I am glad that there is a strong mention of trafficking in human beings . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the House for allowing the President-in-Office to present his important message uninterrupted . #% I can only say to the House that we must accept our responsibilities . #% We need , without a doubt , a fast-track procedure to turn SLIM opinions into legislative proposals , because it all seems to take rather a long time . #% Mr President , this is a good practical proposal from the Commission for doing something about global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions , because , although the total quantity of greenhouse gases being produced from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment is not vast , the amount is growing very substantially year by year -- it is expected to increase 15 times between 1995 and 2010 . #% There have been wrongs on both sides and no justice is served by the pretence that the Turks alone carry the blame . #% I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon . #% 
I would like to see the Commission make full use of its enforcement powers to make sure the current version of the ISD is enforced properly by every single Member State and indeed that the next version of the ISD is also properly enforced . #% If we could have had the Community network of surveillance and control which was proposed , and is still not finally settled , then we might have been more advanced . #% It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players , including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund . #% But with whom do we negotiate and on what basis ? #% There are also must-carry obligations that we expect member governments to enforce . #% We strongly condemn the fact that tobacco-growing Member States were given the option of retaining up to 60 % of the existing aid on tobacco as a coupled payment until 2010 . #% Perhaps this is one reason why Iceland has decided not to even think about joining the EU for many years to come . #% I spent 8 days in the south , reviewing the public health situation in my capacity as the World Health Organisation 's Special Envoy . #% The Christian Democrats , many of whose press releases extolling the virtues of the De Rossa Report are today littering the press centre in Strasbourg , initially voted against the report being prepared . #% Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year , it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid . #% The world 's response , while impressive relative to other areas , is far from that which is required . #% We need that central supply to which the Commissioner referred , because it must be said that no Member State is going to give up its own supplies when the pandemic hits a less-prepared country inside or just outside the European Union . #% However , we must campaign now for the swift signing and ratification of the Convention . #% Lord Bach said that the vote on REACH is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . #% I recently myself visited ETF in Turin and also heard a presentation from Cedefop while I was there . #% Saudi Arabia can surely invest a bit of its own money in doing these things . #% Commissioner Monti 's recent analysis of the market provides evidence that the single market is working . #% Lastly , a monitoring committee which would observe the project throughout its creation will ensure that the project is as transparent and accountable as is necessary . #% I believe my colleagues will speak about those later on . #% Indeed , we were really rather surprised in the Committee on the Environment that the environmental pillar of sustainable development should not be considered of equal importance to the social and economic pillars . #% In each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital . #% I ask this because I understand that 21 Member States are already fully prepared and in a state of readiness . #% A million people were killed because of Saddam ' s assault and predatory efforts inside Iran . #% It is clear that negotiations on modernisation of the career system have led to a consensus about the objectives of changing the system and also about conditions for reforming the system . #% We need a study on this issue before we move to any further legislation . #% I believe that she sought the floor and , like many Members , did not have a chance to put a question to the Commission . #% I am sorry in some sense that it is Commissioner Liikanen who is here this morning . #% It presents all sides very fairly , but it does not shrink from making a number of important and sharply-focused recommendations . #% There are many depressed agricultural areas - and highly depressed farmers - in the West Midlands , my home region in the UK . #% This is necessary to make the CSFP , the Petersberg Tasks mentioned by the Commissioner and the European security and defence identity a reality . #% There are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past . #% It is no business of the EU to tell workers that they can not go bare-chested or wear shorts . #% If we fail to reform our approach to radio spectrum , we are failing European industry , which is poised to become a global leader in communications technology . #% We have reinforced the role of the Parliament , especially in the re-introduction of internal borders . #% Confirmation from the Commissioner that the new regulation on these limits will definitively be in place by 1 January 2003 would be of great comfort . #% When it leaked out that Mandelson and Barroso had enjoyed holidays on billionaires ' yachts , we were told not to worry : there was no conflict whatsoever . #% The Lisbon Agenda has a noble objective : an objective of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world , capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs , greater social cohesion and respect for the environment by 2010 . #% This is not a record to be proud of . #% Just when we are coming to grips with the changing security demands of the post-Cold War world ; just when people are beginning to understand that security is as much about economic and political stability as diplomatic and military action ; just when the Petersberg tasks on humanitarian aid and peacekeeping were agreed as an objective of our security policy , Parliament comes along with a demand for a common deterrent . #% Diana Wallis as a distinguished international lawyer has been the ideal person to work on this very complex file . #% We need a proper single market in sugar which this resolution does not address . #% The report therefore sets out significant internal developments , including the continuing work to establish an EU Fundamental Rights Agency . #% The important thing for us citizens is that , the more supervision is streamlined and cost-reduced , the more jobs are created in a European industry which is competitive at home and abroad . #% We have taken such steps in relation to financial management and it is right that we give equal weight to quality as well as quantity of aid . #% This could be a useful way of showing Brussels that Ukraine really is now independent from Moscow and seriously wants to do business in the international arena . #% Pork is less of a problem and , anyway , my grandmother would say that anyone eating raw pork deserves to be ill . #% Once again we see Europe hamstringing business rather than liberating it . #% Finally , does he agree that it was inappropriate for the leader of the British Conservatives to demand withdrawal of Conservative signatures under the threat of ` very serious consequences ' ? #% I think it is very important , following the EU-China summit - and particularly the EU-China human rights dialogue - that there should be an opportunity for Members of this House to examine the outcome . #% But we must not allow ourselves to be diverted away from the policies that are already being developed and pursued vigorously and necessarily to benefit all of us . #% I also wish to compliment the Council on working with us in informal trialogue towards an agreement at first reading . #% The first -- the oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group that Mr Sonik moved -- is to the change the wording , which , in English , would now read : ` a combined total of up to 1.5 million Jews , Roma , Poles , Russians and prisoners of various other nationalities and homosexuals ' . #% I know how they feel , faced with the prospect of this directive . #% I would be the first to admit that my own country , the United Kingdom , is probably one of the worst examples . #% Whilst I would ask Members to support this text in its entirety , could I ask the President to ask the Council if we could have the answers in writing , please . #% But there is more yet to be done , and in its Clean Air for Europe programme the Commission has identified particulates and ozone as two priorities for action . #% We also need to ensure that the so-called tailor-made derivative instruments allowing companies to hedge against future rises in commodity markets are maintained . #% Most importantly , the US commitment in 1994 to normalise relations , lift the embargo on North Korea - which has been in place for 50 years - and lift the nuclear threat have still not been fulfilled . #% Tomorrow we vote in this House and I hope we will keep the integrity of the Murphy report with its focus on helping passengers with reduced mobility , disabled people , the elderly , small people , parents with children and pushchairs and - dare I say , Commissioner - nimble grannies-to-be who , in the very near future , could be the beneficiaries of this report and be grateful to it . #% It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate . #% I know FIFA has recommended it . #% Mr President , my thanks to the Commissioner for his statement . #% We want to see industry fully involved in the planning , specifications and preparatory stages to ensure a better chance of technical success . #% In any case , the motto of the European Union is `` unity with diversity '' . #% We now need a common list of non-military security and police equipment , and I am happy to accept the amendments on that subject . #% I am deeply cynical about these . #% 
in writing . - The ECR Group are united in the view that the trade in human beings is intolerable and should be stopped . #% Those of us who want to encourage the use of this more environmentally-friendly mode of transport welcome any action that encourages trade by sea . #% I hope Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to confirm that in the event of this proposal becoming law further proposals will follow this one , taking the matter forward -- and rather more quickly than this one has been taken because , if it is not taken more quickly , if I am lucky I will be drawing my pension and if I am unlucky I shall be dead . #% The vote was almost unanimous in committee , but there are one or two small points of disagreement on own-resources . #% It has been absent from discussions with the committees looking at the proposed budget . #% Had the Council been here I would have liked to have asked them for a guarantee tonight that they will do everything possible to reach a common position before the summer , because this situation is incredibly urgent . #% The level of knowledge of the members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism never ceases to amaze me , in regard to technical details such as the number of axles on buses , turning circles of buses , and so on and so forth . #% But could we please stop this farcical pretence that it has got anything to do with the criteria of dealing with the justice system or them fulfilling the . #% That would be particularly useful in the context of enlargement . #% This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime , and that is simply not a matter for the EU . #% The determined boycott of the committee by any representative of the Council is still , sadly , a great omission . #% The Council remains too politicised , and our text today justly criticises those delegates who cynically lined up in their cars outside the UN in Geneva at 6 a.m. in order that they could be first in to fill up the speakers list to help Sri Lanka in its ` no action ' motion to evade criticisms of violations in that country and to evade the spirit of the setting up of the Human Rights Council : that it should work throughout the year to deal with human rights abuses whenever and wherever they occur . #% Mr President , our efforts to create an area of freedom , security and justice are dispersed and rather incoherent . #% Now , a public agency for non-sovereign assets has some attractions , but how do we get over the implied guarantee ? #% We should encourage Internet literacy among children as well their own understanding of what the dangers are and what they should be looking for so that they , too , can play an active part in helping to combat these crimes . #% President Ahmadinejad 's comments about Israel -- made three weeks ago -- have already been condemned stridently and unreservedly by all major political leaders in Europe and beyond . #% Maybe you can slide out of this example and say it is a Member State talking to the Commission and they send them a letter . #% Never let it be forgotten that our actions affect human beings out there in the real world , beyond our cloistered environment . #% I do not know why that is , but I am very quick with the delete button . #% Incidentally , we do not recognise such terminology as ` EU fishing vessels . ' #% The communication from the Commission calls for cooperation , and that is the key word : there has to be cooperation in communication . #% The more appropriate method to handle such agreements and ensure high standards of data protection is through a mechanism of intergovernmental cooperation . #% We need to think hard about qualifications , and qualifications which can be transferred and recognised across the EU . #% The message we must send today is that Tampere must be a summit for citizens , not just the bureaucrats , and democratic accountability must increase . #% I wish I could say that these procedures always go so swiftly but in this case we have a model where many of the reservations that were stated at the outset , many of the fears of commercial interests , many of the fears of parliamentarians , were set at rest by the way in which these procedures went . #% Let us not forget that if the EUR 500 million is rejected then our position is EUR 30 million . #% There was an uncommon delay before the other institutions were prepared even to write this into the preambles , but they have done so and it is now one of the markers which will guide us as we look at how product safety legislation develops . #% I would also ask the Commission to consider introducing a little more flexibility at the stage when projects are being set up . #% Over-prescriptive legislation can turn them into a barrier . #% The problem is - and I put it to Commissioner Bonino , who is going to reply to this debate - that it sometimes seems to observers , who have the safety of the consumer first and foremost in their minds , that we are not really making the rules properly in this discussion . #% But what we got was the usual warm words . #% At the moment my committee , which takes its job seriously in trying to scrutinise the budget , simply does not have the facts at its disposal to make a proper quantitative , as well as qualitative assessment , of what is happening to the budgets for transport and the Structural Funds . #% I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a `` scoreboard '' showing the amount of state aid per Member State . #% I believe that the opinion of the public at large says something along the lines that had any commercial undertaking safeguarded its interests and its shareholders ' interests with the same degree of cavalier inadequacy as the Commission has protected the taxpayer , then the only thing that would be booming would be bankruptcies . #% . I abstained because I am chairman of the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art in the UK . #% My difficulties - and she knows this - are with the burden of proof as set out in these amendments and also on the question of development risk . #% Their contribution to the fight against the disease was equally valid . #% It states that both Council and Commission have pulled back from the decision to create such an observatory , such a centre . #% I do not think regular debates on this basis are helpful . #% I hope that is understood . #% We will look closely at the latest budget proposals expected from the Presidency today . #% It is a little distressing and I intend to pursue the matter . #% Mr President , it is well known that this Parliament struggles to communicate with the people it supposedly represents . #% In Fiji the aim must be to restore the legitimate government elected on the basis of the 1997 multi-racial constitution , which was approved by both ethnic groups - Indo-Fijians and indigenous Fijians . #% Up to 23 % of its territory was contaminated ; about 2 million people - including 500 000 children - live in the radioactively contaminated areas . #% To the Mexican Government I say : you tell us you wish to end excessive militarization , to disarm the armed groups , to welcome bona fide international assistance and to promote the rights of indigenous people . #% Yet we should consider how we are going to deal with people who donate across international borders . #% The unification that so many of us want to see must be brought about in a manner which meets the concerns and interests of both communities on the island , not just one . #% We come up against these two rather simple things and get into a very complicated , legalistic argument with the Member States and the Council . #% It is an urgent issue because in recent months we have seen various measures being taken by the Chinese government to move people into the area of Tibet and to exploit the natural resources there . #% If he does sign up to it , let us be clear : it will mean the end of our right to self-government . #% With regard to some of my earlier points , I feel that the lowering of the thresholds and the simplified definitions also apply here . #% . Mr President , the election schedule for this Sunday is critical for the future of Ukraine . #% It has spent a huge amount of blood and treasure in the defence of Western values . #% I would not wish people to become any more confused than we already are . #% Mr President , the utility of the European arrest warrant was illustrated , especially for my constituents in London , when Hussein Osman , a suspect in the 21 July attempted bombings , was returned to Britain to face justice in weeks rather than years . #% Therefore , the real question is not what caused the crisis this year , but what is causing endemic hunger and poverty . #% Our continent faces an obesity epidemic on a scale never before seen . #% 1999 was the first full year of this particular set of initiatives and , therefore , as a start-up phase it should have been relatively straightforward to report upon this without being too controversial . #% The regional approach is important , and I look forward to hearing how we are going to deal with other areas of real tension , such as Kashmir , which the Afghan Ambassador told us the other day really provides a problem for everything that people try to do in the region . #% We criticise the Commission when we need to , but you have put forward an excellent regulation and I hope it will be passed swiftly . #% Of course , this is a man who would not know one end of a railway locomotive from the other and whose expertise is restricted to Thomas the Tank Engine . #% I have been a long-time opponent of the EU having a role in these two policy fields , which I sincerely believe must remain the sole prerogative of the sovereign Member States . #% Those of us who have felt that occasionally we did not prevail when we should , owe it to her that the door is open for further and better changes after these initial steps . #% Mr President , in this seriously flawed presidential election , we have good grounds for believing that Mugabe in reality lost the vote , but merely contrived to win the count . #% I want them to bring justice to the Tibetans and withdraw their threat of imposing their Panchen Lama . #% 
I want to pay tribute both to the Commissioner and to the Commission staff for their support , as also to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets , who was extremely supportive . #% However , I would draw Members ' attention to paragraph 46 , which reminds the Commission that imports from third countries do not always provide the levels of safety and quality that the European consumer has grown accustomed to : hence the need to guarantee that third country products meet the same safety and quality requirements as European Union products . #% Mr President , just a couple of small points at the outset : clearly the Seattle Ministerial Conference failed to agree on a new round because developing countries refused to proceed with trade liberalisation . #% This is good news not only for people who do not want to buy products that contain real fur or leather , but also for those who suffer from allergies . #% I am also concerned that we do not see serious enough measures put in place in this work programme to try and get serious financial control over the EU budget . #% The Commission 's reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution , as an organisation , currently undertakes its duties . #% It was reported to me at lunchtime by a representative of the duty-free lobby that there were at the most 6 , 000 people there . #% Many species are down to danger levels -- plaice and sole today , something else tomorrow . #% So the death holds a symbolism for the future : an opportunity to break with the past . #% On this occasion it is : If that is difficult for the interpreters , that is the oldest language -- or one of them -- of Europe . #% We will do our very best to help you in the job that you have taken on . #% Let me illustrate this with a topical example . #% Mr President , speaking as a European Democrat , it is about time that the Lisbon strategy of driving forward competitiveness and innovation in European economies be properly implemented . #% I address my remarks to two senior politicians who both occupy positions of responsibility at a very sensitive time for Europe . #% Fortunately for Mr Prodi , he is safely back in Rome and is no longer answerable for his failures . #% We know precisely what they face because without the protection of treaty they are constantly confronting a larger power - one which has all the power and all the regiments of lawyers you could possibly want - which can smash them down . #% On current trends , by 2020 the number of deaths and injuries from war and violence will overtake the number of deaths caused by diseases such as malaria and measles . #% Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes . #% It is European taxpayers ' money that is involved . #% Agricultural subsidies have an enormous , crushing effect on developing country producers and markets . #% However , I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause . #% But this is a subsidiarity measure which leaves the details to Member States . #% My colleagues are going to take a careful note of your response . #% Modest growth in itself will not bring those jobs . #% Finally , as one who has been involved in quality assurance in educational procedures in the United Kingdom , I urge the Commission and anybody involved in this to keep it simple : we do not want too much bureaucracy or a procedure where form-filling and record-taking are seen as important rather than delivering good education , which is what is called for . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , High Representative , I congratulate Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on an excellent report on the EU 's strategic relationship and partnership with Latin America . #% We should be talking about the protection of vulnerable individuals : simple procedures , yes ; riskier procedures , no . #% The only way to change that is by a new unanimous decision of the Heads of Government . #% I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked . #% That murder has been met by a wall of silence and intimidation little different from that imposed by the Mafia elsewhere . #% The WTO has taken concrete steps to improve the transparency and democratic participation in its decision-making processes , yet there remain basic flaws , which many of my contributions to this report have sought to address . #% Unless there have been developments which the Commissioner could refer to , I understand that the United Kingdom - which is always critical of other countries that do not ratify agreements such as Kyoto - has not ratified Marpol Annex VI . #% It should also have monitored its adequacy . #% As opposed to 40 years , there is a big difference . #% That is why they do not want the legislation on the floor of this House . #% That is the vital role of this proposal . #% Access to foreign television , however , is common , as most Tunisian households have access to satellite television . #% It is important in this global age to have as broad an input as possible for the evaluation system . #% This is a key part of the Financial Services Action Plan and of creating a single market in financial services . #% We talk about a world where we can celebrate difference , where there is no persecution because someone 's colour , creed , belief or sexuality is different from another 's . #% I fully support the notion of providing financial assistance to minority and lesser-spoken languages , and like many colleagues I am familiar with the educational programmes and the work of the Bureau . #% But it does provide European Union citizens , civil society partners and governments and human rights defenders in third countries with a regular , accessible overview of EU concerns , priorities and actions . #% We want more research to be carried out on the effect of naval sonars . #% I hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them . #% The Congolese Government has not requested it . #% Financing operations to progressively take over from humanitarian action and paving the way for long-term development planning is very welcome . #% There is no point in us talking about funding for sites if the Commission does not know what the sites are . #% The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere . #% We are strongly against the trafficking of all people and slavery , but we do not feel that it is the competence of the EU to interfere in domestic issues , and in particular we do not feel that the EU should be creating a policy regarding prostitution . #% We in the EU must give the new Tunisian government of unity every assistance and also afford every assistance to EU citizens , including British citizens , who are stranded , having been in Tunisia on a holiday . #% Thank you for a very complex and interesting reply , which needs to be read carefully . #% In fact , I made reference to media reports of a former Turkish Government 's alleged provision of covert support to Islamist groups in their fight against the Kurdish PKK , and made no reference to the current Prime Minister , Mr Erdogan . #% Certainly , in the United Kingdom , there is still much to do . #% Does it add to or replace the Convention on Human Rights to which all EU Member States and applicant states are signatories , or does it just add another judicial forum , leaving lawyers with the happy and profitable choice between the European Court and the Court of Human Rights ? #% Mr President , when I spoke on the Görlach report on rural development late last year , I said that this Parliament should be honest as to whether it is serious about reform of the common agricultural policy . #% It clarifies Parliament 's position . #% The House needs to know whether they ` will ' be considered . #% The short answer is that you are correct . #% The leader of my party , the Conservative Party , David Cameron , is committed to holding a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty if it has not already entered into force . #% There are many Member States , particularly in southern and eastern-central Europe who are going to find themselves constantly in breach of this legislation , no matter what they do . #% Fourthly , that the couple must not have access to legal marriage in a Member State . #% The source text dates as far back as 1979 and , apart from the codification process of incorporating amendments that have been made over that period into the legislative text , the reason for this more substantive report is that the Commission has found it necessary to propose a number of amendments to reflect changes that have taken place in the market since that time and to improve the overall quality and integrity of the text . #% I welcome particularly in this regard the proposed amendment to Article 158 of the Treaty , as also the thrust towards mainstreaming issues of structural disadvantage into EU policy more generally . #% I would like to talk just briefly about some of the amendments tabled in the report by Mrs Smet . #% I hope very much that Parliament will support it , and I will come back to that . #% However , such niceties are being ignored . #% 
Cheap imports are flooding in and we have economic problems . #% By keeping the original thresholds , small businesses would have once again been ignored by Europe which , it would seem , is merely interested in showcase schemes which , while looking good , do not benefit the people who paid for them - us or the taxpayers . #% I consider the Chirac/Schroeder deal on this to be a shabby affair , a clandestine deal in this age of transparency . #% Mrs Stenius-Kaukonen has produced an insightful and thorough report which has been done practically through hard work in our committee . #% Mr President , I am saddened by what I have heard here this afternoon from our Polish colleagues from the League of Polish Families and the Law and Justice Party . #% Terrorism and terrorist groups have won when the rule of law is set aside . #% This is just one element of an overall package of proposals that were brought forward by the Commission last November to try to plug the loopholes of the sectors that were excluded from the original working-time directive back in 1993 . #% Examples include setting up independent bodies to advise all the public agencies in the country concerned on how to work with the public procurement directives . #% Pouring aid into Malta is not the answer . #% Last Thursday night , a colleague of ours , Linda McAvan , was involved in a very serious car accident . #% I urge a note of caution on the question of emissions trading . #% Members may wish to dwell on the fact that a voluntary code of practice did exist with the more reliable airlines . #% They unlocked them , took off the rope that was binding them and then 20 minutes later they were locked and bound again . #% That has been changed quite significantly . #% I wish we could in many ways , but I would be misleading the House if I suggested that we have , or are likely to get , that kind of massive power for change . #% Yes , Israel must accept that there has to be a Palestinian state in secure borders . #% I sincerely hope , though , that this particular piece of legislation may be stopped . #% As I have previously stated , I have been the rapporteur on a number of matters , but if I can just give you a thumbnail sketch of just how extensive this review will be and what it will cover - universal service , frequencies , satellite , regulation , licences , interconnections , numbering , mobile telephones , convergence of broadcasting , data transmission and telecommunications - an explosion of legislation and an enormous segment of the European Union 's manufacturing , industrial and commercial base in its own right , but also as an adjunct to so many other industries . #% Illegal detention without charge or trial in Guantanamo Bay or Iraq is bad enough , but secret detention , where people are kept incommunicado with no access to lawyers and at the mercy of mistreatment or torture , is the blackest of black holes . #% Can that be put into the record . #% In fact , Europe is the second largest market in itself , after the US . #% These are apparently needed by manufacturers because they produce an equal spray of fat on the utensil concerned . #% Mr President , I have an interest to declare : I chair the Energy Efficiency Advice Centre which operates in the northern half of the region that I represent . #% As Mr Chanterie has also pointed out concerning the training of doctors , if they are to have survivable periods of work and if we are to get the very best out of these professionals , we must all do our best to put pressure on our governments to get a reduction in working time for them so that their judgments and their reactions are not skewed or affected in such a way that we are not gaining the optimum benefits of their training . #% As its full implications have sunk in , some Member States have been quietly attempting to restrict the scope of its application and backpedal on its implications . #% We thought we had got somewhere when we got the Council Regulation of 1991 , disappointed though we were that it was going to be five years before it was implemented . #% I have always supported the highest civil and political rights and good governance for all states . #% In the pursuit of solutions , it is important to address questions to the institutions , rather than to produce formal set-piece statements . #% That is when soft systems not backed by black letter law fail our citizens and do not deliver justice . #% It is important in terms not only of enhancing human rights outside the Union but also of giving European defence companies a level and fair playing field in the sphere of arms exports . #% However , many implementation problems might be avoided and quicker adaptation made to technological and other change if such rules could come out of agreements between the social partners . #% It is very discourteous to make that sort of remark , openly in the Chamber , when the Member concerned is not present . #% For that reason , apart from any other , I am pleased with this report and I hope that it is supported in the House tomorrow . #% We need the SNCF to resume services as soon as possible and we need urgent modifications to locomotives to ensure they do not need to stop at Calais purely for technical reasons . #% It may be true that Mr Howitt may be wrong , as may the NGOs , but is it not equally true that so might the Commission ? #% Twenty-seven ACP countries are dependent on coffee . #% Our amendment is trying to be helpful by giving motorists that choice , that additional right to display a European symbol if they so desire rather than the white ellipse . #% I very much welcome the 10 May deadline and the insistence that substantial , immediate progress be made by then on the heads of terms . #% Following the long , drawn-out conciliation process , we have before us something which is still blind to the realities of the haulage , distribution and public transport sectors . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , most people know - but many do not - that , shortly after a country becomes a member of the EU , all its trade agreements are negotiated by the Commission and , specifically , the EU Trade Commissioner . #% They think we are the weakest link , and the signal we are sending them is that they are absolutely correct . #% The members of the committee agreed with me that a recommendation is far too weak an instrument in this instance . #% Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case . #% The work of the Euromed is based largely on its committees . #% All sides -- the LTTE , Colonel Karuna and the Sri Lankan Government -- must realise that there can be no military solution and that peace negotiations without preconditions are the only way forward . #% At the last debate , we warned against the Spanish and Polish Governments ' proposal to revert to the Nice formula for voting in the Council quite a selfish proposal if I might say so . #% Firstly , there were so many committees set up with so many different procedures with nobody quite sure who sat on which that there was a major problem of transparency . #% I often think - because it is usually the case with employment legislation - that it is all a plot by the Secretariat to remind us of the folly of the working time directive , not that we need to be reminded of that particular folly on that particular directive . #% Our job as a European Parliament , your job as a Commission and the job of the Council is to make sure that between now and 1 January 1999 , and particularly 2002 , the citizens accept and welcome all the work that we have done and the creation of that single currency . #% All the candidates were competent and some held views which some of us did not agree with . #% Further to what the President-in-Office has said , could he try to make sure that the Council discussions on the EU action plan on trafficking is in the public domain , because we do not have any information about it at present . #% Indeed , one of the things I welcome in this report is its recognition of the wide variety of reasons for people being trafficked . #% He has given us a fair amount of detail and a fair number of promises about what is happening or will happen . #% As others have said , this is an aspirational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create . #% The swift action of the Japanese police going into the company may enable us to establish whether that is the case . #% Is it to be from one rather than the other ? #% As I am sure you know , this is an issue of great concern to a lot of people across the European Union , and they will want to know that we are tackling it with a great degree of urgency . #% These killings and other attacks have been unreservedly condemned by the World Hindu Council . #% Mr President , I salute Carole Tongue for her commitment and her eloquence in this cause . #% Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a Members bar ? #% Nor must we try to find solutions with negative historical connotations , such as train corridors . #% That itself demonstrates what we already know : this Parliament has nothing to do with representing the wishes of the people ; it has its own agenda , which has nothing to do with democracy . #% I welcome the brave attempt by the Danish presidency to put an extra EUR 1 billion on the table in order to clear the decks so we do not have these complicated negotiations in Copenhagen . #% There is nothing to reflect about . #% Now it seems more a case of people loose in the Tunnel and trains and trade cut off - which is altogether more serious . #% This territory is a haven for gansterism , smuggling and money laundering and corrupts the local authorities around the Odessa oblast in Ukraine . #% 
There is a very strong gender dimension to the pension issue . #% Taiwan , like Hong Kong , is already a full member of the WTO , as the People 's Republic of China saw commercial advantage in having it in the organisation . #% It is nothing personal . #% Animals frequently still find themselves crammed into overcrowded trucks , given neither food nor water , often for journeys flouting the current limits and travelling for up to 30 or 40 hours . #% In a year when the Council has evaluated the human rights dialogues with specific countries , the finding that the dialogue with China has had little , if any , impact is indeed a very important one . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Damião for all her work and I hope that she will get well soon . #% Mr Solana speaks as though the European Union common foreign and security policy is an accomplished fact . #% However , the Article 29 Working Party has stated that they are exposed anyway to sanction for breach of data protection legislation . #% Neither has it the necessary materials to produce the gas centrifuges , or the quality or quantity of electricity -- which would have to be enough to power a medium-sized city in Europe -- to undertake that programme . #% We may have to revisit this issue in future , but at least we are finally taking some action . #% December 1996 will be seen as a watershed for the whole process of economic and monetary union . #% Consumers should also be able to see from the labelling which products have not met those high standards . #% I have seen young people in areas of particular social exclusion in my own Member State , who did not know very much about the south-east of England , let alone the south-east of France or Spain , blossom and come forth in terms in confidence and educational capacity as a result of their interactions with other students from other Member States . #% Only two featured the whole WTO membership and the majority were exclusive and secret ` green rooms ' . #% Thank you for the answer . #% Parliament 's resolution the green paper identified the fundamental aim of the CFP as attaining a balance between the two . #% The achievement should be an organisation in which advancement is on merit , an organisation in which all members of staff in the Commission know that they have clear goals , know what those goals are , know that if they meet or exceed those goals their performance is going to be fully recognised . #% What I see and hear from the Commission is that there does not seem to be very much understanding of how we can actually integrate tourism into the broader development strategies we have ; that ought to be positive and something that can be thought about . #% We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line . #% He has as usual , been conscientious and assiduous in his work . #% We want to give our citizens across the Union real access to justice so that when they have to resort to the courts they can get things up and running quickly and without difficulties . #% Mr President , I share some of Mrs Thyssens ' reservations about what we are being asked to do here and the degree of expertise with which we do it . #% As the presidency has again confirmed this afternoon , ESDP is all about European integration . #% Maybe someone will ask about that and if there are any ideas we will be grateful to hear them . #% Therefore I call on the Members here present to go back to their various countries and make urgent representations to their own governments to pull the plug . #% What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned , and for how long ? #% I therefore urge the Commissioner to go further and reduce the percentage of fins that can be landed . #% Many managers can not recognise it in themselves and can not manage it in others . #% Are we trying to save energy ? #% There is effective legal precaution . #% That office is overdue for a visit of inspection from your department - possibly , from the Financial Controller and possibly also from the Court of Auditors . #% Far from being at the centre of a development agenda to help poorer nations out of poverty , the US tariff barriers reveal how that country uses trade rules to gain access to other people 's markets , while protecting its own industrial interests at home . #% I am sure that other countries have had the same experience . #% Who gave those orders ? #% Madam President , the reasons given for this directive are the usual ones about the fight against terrorism and organised crime , but this is a red herring . #% Madam President , like others I congratulate the rapporteur for the very serious and positive work on this dossier and endorse everything that he said in his introductory statement this morning . #% It has already been moved by orders of Israel 's Supreme Court to accommodate local Palestinians ' needs . #% From the comments of Commissioner Kinnock , the Commission might examine this tomorrow or next week . #% But , clearly as well , there are going to be unprofitable services and the question is how we can ensure that service levels are maintained and , indeed , improved . #% Tonight we are discussing an unnecessary EUR 10 million . #% Universal access , widespread development of broadband and skilled development are fundamental to successful transition . #% We can not do that unless we do what we did with the other Central and Eastern European countries and are prepared to spend the money we have promised : that is the crucial factor . #% I arrived from Basle in the bus , with a number of colleagues from various countries , to find the gates barred . #% Indeed , Britain is already the second largest contributor to the budget and without the rebate , it would make us the largest . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to be Parliament 's rapporteur on the disability action plan . #% The UK has a huge , permanent and growing deficit with the EU . #% That authoritarian capitalism may not evolve gently into the democratic and responsible capitalism we enjoy today in Europe and the West . #% In that sense , in the longer term , we would want to move towards a mandatory register where everybody is treated equally . #% We should not be spinning and pretending otherwise . #% We need to ensure - and this report goes a long way towards it - that the procedures do not negate the situation or make it worse , but rather , that they support and assist the victims . #% When you share a joint bank account with your neighbour you are affected by the actions and the spending decisions of your neighbour . #% For the four euro-area Member States whose budgets are not yet fully compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact - France , Germany , Italy and Portugal - it is wholly reasonable that they should continue the process of putting their underlying budget positions right . #% Even worse , this is happening inside our European Union . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Spain and Poland on their courageous and principled stand at the recent IGC , which resulted in the failure of the wretched draft Constitution . #% The businesses and individuals who create the wealth of Europe all have to act with restraint and they do not have jobs for life . #% Mr President , I want to talk mainly about Mrs Péry 's report , for which congratulations and support . #% My last point concerns accountability . #% Although two payments have been made by the European Union , not one brick has been laid . #% British Conservatives have consistently opposed a Common Asylum and Immigration Policy and believe that these policies should be determined by Member States . #% What is important about this proposal ? #% Mr President , I thank Mr Cornillet for his excellent and wide-ranging report , which covered all the points raised in the debate this morning . #% They do not have access to the iridium sources needed for this equipment to work . #% We want to know what other sources he thinks we may develop . #% The reason for the embargo is the initial invasion by Turkey that took place so many years ago . #% It is reported that there are 1 460 000 internally displaced people , most of them facing violence , and let me give a voice to those who do not have a voice , those who suffer such violence . #% Secondly , I should like to reiterate to Commissioner Patten that the fact that the Commission brought forward no money for Latin America in their preliminary budget is bizarre particularly when 2.1 million displaced people exist in Colombia . #% 
There have been disturbing cases where articles from China have been found to contain levels of toxic materials that are significantly above the limits laid down in the European Union to safeguard human health . #% Mr President , I strongly commend these recommendations and the amendments which the rapporteur has put forward . #% Mr Bloom may not have been able to hear it because his colleague , Mr Batten , was trying to get the attention of the House on the question of the referendum and spoke throughout the early part of my speech . #% -- Mr President , I certainly do not often speak on behalf of farmers , but my region in the northeast of England has suffered the worst weather and the worst harvest in 40 years . #% We want to try and rationalize the number of coins that we are using and indeed in many of our Member States we are reducing the number of coins in terms of their denominations . #% There is no smile on the face of Wissam Abyad , in prison and badly treated since January , after just one meeting . #% My other political point concerns the common foreign and security policy . #% If you are going to apply the precautionary principle to toxic chemicals , let us look at it in the context of the chemicals directive . #% I would like to reply to Miss McIntosh by saying that what would be applicable in one particular country is applicable to all of the Member States . #% That is true of both the bodies I have mentioned . #% Mr President , the paper ` Citizens ' agenda : delivering results for Europe ' is to be welcomed in the emphasis placed on policy delivery rather than on institutional grand designs . #% This morning Commissioner Piebalgs mentioned , in a question-and-answer session , that there would be certification to underwrite the sustainability of biofuels . #% Mr President , this brings us to the conclusion of a momentous two years for the European Union , which began with the 1996 discharge and its refusal . #% -- Mr President , could I ask the Verts/ALE Group to accept this amendment as a supplement to the paragraph and not as a substitute for it ? #% We should always remember that we are responding to the strategy that was agreed in Amsterdam . #% We have tabled no amendments to this report , but we shall support the constructive amendments relating to the issue of safe third countries . #% I would like to take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur on the importance he placed on having a common working language to be able to work effectively and , in particular , handle crisis situations . #% Today that is patently obvious ! #% It is disastrous , the number of long term unemployed people who are not in education or training in Europe . #% The Liberal Democrats welcome this measure . #% I also welcome the principle involved in the proposal on decommissioning waste -- the principle of setting deadlines for adopting a programme and choosing a site . #% It is clear that the European Union has been moving in that direction . #% It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments , if carried , would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America . #% I would ask you to seek from the Belgian Government an undertaking that citizens of the European Union , including research assistants of Members of this Parliament , will be free to exercise their religious beliefs free from surveillance , harassment and defamation . #% -- Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , as I understand it , Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra proposes removing the word ` deplore ' as part of a deal that maintains the support for the Brazilian initiative in this paragraph . #% They get concerned about budgetary considerations and , as a result , we lose the competitive advantage that we have gained in so many areas . #% It needs to show that it is ready to move on to an ambitious reform programme that tackles those very issues that I referred to of low growth , high unemployment and threats to our environment . #% Poverty eradication and sustainable development are somehow automatically meant to follow , yet poorer countries have known for a long time that this is often far from the case . #% Of course it presupposes basic approval for the Commission proposals #% Without this exemption , it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis , for each bovine animal exported from its region . #% It would also reflect the current working patterns within an industry because shifts are a lot less than they are in other sections of the industry . #% There are many unsafe sexual practices between the sexes , as well as between men , and we should not stigmatize the entire gay community in what we say tonight . #% The President-in-Office will be aware that , since February 2005 , non-EU/EEA nationals have to obtain Home Office permission to get married in the United Kingdom . #% It was a crucial issue at the Lisbon Summit and new product innovation is one of the key competitive aspects of European business . #% As regards finance , the HELIOS II programme was designed to co-finance the exchange of ideas simultaneously right across the Union and so it nicely complements the European Social Fund which cofinances innovative action in the Member States . #% We should not forget that this report is based on the 1996 budget and we would hope that the staff who will manage the resources within Parliament will be as the Secretary-General expects and certainly as we expect . #% The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed . #% Most of their nightmares come from past misguided attempts by the EU to ` help ' with trade on the Continent . #% This group supports Mrs González 's report . #% Mr President , before I start might I ask that someone remove the ` t ' from my name up on the screen because it is quite unnerving really ! #% We have to inform people about their rights and about access to medicines . #% Already the fund has committed 13 % of its money to the Americas . #% This is of importance to the UK because of the unique method of funding of the BBC and we welcome this confirmation that the European Parliament will not try to intrude into the funding methods used in the UK to fund the BBC . #% These are important historical issues but they are not conditions for accession to the European Union . #% Finally , Iceland must commit to repaying monies owed to the UK and the Netherlands after the collapse of Icesave . #% What is wrong therefore with tax competition ? #% There is an interinstitutional framework agreement for parliamentary access . #% It is important because one in seven of us have a mental health problem at any one time . #% I invite other political groups in Parliament next year to join us in focusing more exclusively on holding the Council and the Commission to account on how effectively these instruments are used . #% This morning Commissioner Mandelson and I were at a G90 meeting , where we heard the grievances of the ACP countries in particular . #% In that respect we have been rightly critical of a piecemeal approach , improperly researched . #% If we are looking at the international context , to some of us that is about GATS , where we have heard certain things about what is really , in theory , on the table and then we hear about background negotiating positions which are leading to something else . #% The manager then came out and said `` You ca n't come in here . #% The Commission 's own disciplinary process is clearly unable to take the appropriate action against employees who commit hideous and , in some cases , criminal offences . #% Under those accords , the parties were supposed to have negotiated the final status issues by 4 May this year but sadly that has not happened . #% We want to see insects and wild plants flourish in our countryside . #% I speak as rapporteur for Bulgaria , a country on course for joining the European Union in 2007 . #% As you said , the proposal for which I am responsible is that relating to the enforcement of seafarers ' hours of work on board ships using Community ports . #% I welcome the report , even if some of the above proposals fell . #% I thank both the Commissioner and the High Representative for restating this afternoon Europe 's commitment to a negotiated , not unilateral , solution . #% I have called on the Commission to assist in the development of a cost-efficient oral , multi-strain vaccine . #% Whatever is the case , the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences . #% In reply to Mr Milinkevich this morning , it is true now that that instrument can have the capacity to operate within his country , without his country 's consent as Mrs Flautre says . #% The same arguments can equally well apply here in that we are encouraging prudent risk management and rewarding those that manage and reduce risk . #% The president was still the same person and 402 of the 407 staff that were working in the EMI changed also to the ECB . #% They fear the truth . #% 
I could say on behalf of my Group that ` we told you so ' as now , by and large , the majority of this House seems to have arrived at the same position -- so we make progress . #% Despite the backing of this House , Pakistan was denied GSP + status by the Council , at a cost of 300 000 jobs and GBP 40 million a year . #% Pastrana 's policy of granting concessions to the FARC , labelled a terrorist organisation by the USA , has remarkable parallels with the policy of Britain 's Tony Blair of granting early release to IRA killers without a prior insistence on the arms decommissioning to which they had already agreed . #% The Commission has brought forward a development policy statement and it is time , through the budget , that it matched its words with deeds . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by agreeing with Mrs Jackson that we are sinking , perhaps not as fast as the Titanic , but I understand this building is built on very soft ground . #% Mr President , on 27 June of this year Glyn Ford and I attended a vigil outside the US Embassy in London to protest against the United States Government 's failure to pay its dues to the United Nations . #% We could have drawn some very useful information from this survey on the socio-economic circumstances of students on Erasmus courses at that time . #% In terms of the amendments , we will certainly be opposing Amendment No 47 and I have to express some reservations on Amendments Nos 35 and 41 , which we may be unable to support . #% Who are we to believe -- a large number of national regulatory bodies , legally responsible and accountable for examining evidence objectively on the basis of science or , for example , the Internet campaign that we have seen only this week suggesting that the tragic ferry accident at Staten Island in New York was somehow due to aspartame ? #% I would like to hear from the Council and the Commission how they intend to use the ASEM Summit to bring home the importance of developing projects aimed at good governance in the Far East so that we can build from a stronger economy in the future . #% We must monitor projects very carefully . #% The annual reports and the promised follow-up report in January 2004 may well prove that this report , this agreement , is not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning . #% Iraq is about to have its first democratic constitution , which , although lacking support from the Sunni community , as least has on board the Shias and the Kurds , has avoided an Islamic theocracy , and kept women involved in the process . #% Mr De Rossa mentioned the difficulties about education and employment . #% Fourthly , as many Members have said , we must ensure liability ; but it is a question of whether we need any greater liability than applies to other environmental risks . #% Successive governments in Romania and Bulgaria have made superhuman efforts to comply with the advice and recommendations of the European Union . #% The uncomfortable truth is that there are losers as well as winners from international trade . #% I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that . #% Mr President , my group in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety endorses the approach of our draftsman Mr Sturdy , not least in his encomia for the general rapporteur Mr Parish , and for the Commissioner and his emphasis throughout on studied vigilance rather than either hysteria or complacency . #% It must be admitted that we had quite a debate with the Council about whether to include a definition of security of supply in this proposal and , if so , what that definition should be . #% As everybody knows , I do not believe in the European Union ; I regard it as an enemy of democracy , and I approach this from an opposite direction . #% Mr President , on the point made by my friend Mr Tannock , concerning the failure to have a proper debate on the proposed resolution on the Palestinian Authority 's spending of EU funds , this is not a question of legality . #% One of our main conditions is that an assessment be carried out of the changes that have occurred and the action that still needs to be taken . #% Europe is boldly marching backwards to sixth-century Arabia . #% We appreciate that very much and thank him for his work . #% The appalling onslaught against minorities in Egypt is terrifying to behold . #% We should make that clear to everyone . #% We would like to be clear on what the Commission will be proposing in terms of these subsidies for particular institutions . #% Although this House has never been allowed to see the responses , it is obvious that the Commission was still not satisfied , since it launched infringement proceedings . #% Why should that be otherwise ? #% That willonly be achieved when we have business-friendly policies and an environment in which people want to go out and start businesses , whether in services or in manufacturing and technical innovation . #% I hope that on 1 May we will enter into a brave new world of solidarity and cooperation , not of recriminations and national tensions . #% That clearly is not the case . #% Only yesterday at the end of the debate on Mr Needle 's report on European public health policy Commissioner Bangemann pointed out the contradiction of spending vastly more public money on supporting a product which undermines health than on public health programmes . #% The numbers , as some of us have already seen in the field , are overwhelming the capacity of families and communities to cope . #% Finally , the Commission and the Member States involved have a responsibility to ensure that action is taken against any guilty parties identified during the investigation . #% Mr President , we made a decision earlier that we would have an urgency on Zimbabwe . #% The DPRK agreed in 1994 to freeze and dismantle its nuclear programme , and by its recent admission of possession of nuclear weapons it has clearly breached the non-proliferation treaty and the agreed framework of KEDO . #% Finally , Commissioner Fischer Boel 's most recent statements suggest that Parliament 's overwhelming opposition to the proposal can not be totally ignored and that some form of compromise may emerge . #% I am happy that we have been able to retain the cap on the number of credits issued . #% It is obvious that the Council will never agree to a new flexibility instrument , but if we can get some agreement on using the existing emergency reserves in a similar way for category 4 , which would be by a codecision procedure , we may make some headway . #% All I can suggest now -- and there have been some very strong speeches made here -- is that we take a check on reality . #% As India moves from developing to developed , it bears regional responsibility and sustained growth . #% In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68 % GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region . #% In Wales he would be known as ` Wynn the Discharge ' . #% I know we have got a good message to say , so let us go out there and spread the word . #% There have been some highly controversial competition issues in recent months in our relationship with the United States - Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas being one , Guinness and Grand Met being another , and KPMG and Ernst & Young being potentially another . #% Well , it is making it unnecessarily expensive to import non-GM soya beans . #% Phosphates are the key question buried inside this proposal . #% I will of course pass on the other documentation that I have received . #% We want something done about unemployment . #% Last night I received a document chart showing the lines where the problems were , and hopefully the Commission has come forward with solutions . #% The Legal Affairs Committee has come up with a pragmatic solution . #% It was a resounding vote of no confidence on the government in office , and a heartfelt demand for real progress , improvement and change : a leap of faith . #% Mr President , I hope nobody listening to this debate is in any doubt about the seriousness of the course we are about to embark upon . #% author . - Mr President , Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit has now been held hostage by the Jihadi fanatics of Hamas for over three years . #% It is clear that we are not creating a centralised Union . #% My understanding is that the Ford Genk plant will remain open : this is a question of adjusting production by taking off a shift because Ford wants to match production to demand . #% After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ? #% We need to try to define what we mean by an ethically orientated foreign policy for the European Union and we need to try to find a better balance between the institutions . #% That evidence needs to be taken into account in the attitudes we take in terms of the EUR 4 billion of budgetary spending that has been allocated . #% Amendments have been proposed that also look at the problem of cabin baggage . #% The very future of our railways is at stake , together with the jobs of one million people employed in the industry . #% There would be no need for a Budgets Committee if this were agreed at the IGC . #% The final course it takes will depend upon the successful negotiated outcome to the peace process . #% Mrs Schroedter raised the question of a hearing with my colleague , Mr Patten , in the Foreign Affairs Committee . #% 
Similarly , it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines . #% I would ask him to reiterate that assurance tonight and , if possible , tomorrow morning before we vote , so that lawyers at least know their position will be subject to review . #% Mr President , I am sorry that the Commissioner himself can not be with us today , but I understand he has to be in China . #% This combination was successful in dragging Member States and national regulatory authorities - some of them kicking and screaming - towards a workable pan-European approach . #% Cross-border e-commerce in financial services is in its infancy and it has not chased prices down to the level of the cheapest Member State . #% As many have said , equality of treatment is a key principle for European citizens , which should apply to employment conditions and access to services within our Member States across the Union . #% Mr President , as you know I currently chair Parliament 's delegation for the United States of America and I should like to raise a point of order under Parliament 's rules concerning parliamentary delegations . #% I declare my own interest as an occasional producer for public service as well as for commercial channels in the United Kingdom . #% The disincentive of high capital costs of connection to the grid from remote renewable sites and the prevention of transmission penalties are other issues which the directive should tackle . #% Of course we welcome the signing on 15 October of the peace agreement between the government in Sudan and the SPLA . #% The Commission is concerned , however , that the questions raised have been met by only routine denials and have not been properly addressed in Russia . #% The Women 's Institute , including representatives I met with this week from Cambridge and Bury St. Edmunds , said we should put the environment and consumer safety first , and I am deeply proud that the European Parliament as a whole has been persuaded by their campaign . #% At the very beginning of February my colleagues and I wrote to Commissioner Dimas to ask this question . #% It may be imperfect as Members both for and against are arguing tonight but it represents a step in the right direction towards better access and choice for patients , the removal of barriers for responsible and properly regulated practitioners , recognized standards of training and qualification and the possibility of sensible integration into future conventional health systems at an appropriate later stage . #% What assurances can we have that the flying public will not be ill-served by this measure ? #% It would also ruin the pretence that the European Council respected the role of national parliaments . #% I know this is meant to be a human rights issue , and indeed it is about the rights of ordinary people . #% That would be bad for the Chinese people . #% Lastly , given the initiatives about which you have spoken in the framework of the OECD and the changes by the World Bank , does the Council intend to press for new European Union procurement rules so as to prevent corruption more effectively ? #% Mr Blair , the British Prime Minister , told Parliament when he introduced the British Presidency , ' I am a passionate pro-European ' . #% India has proved itself adept at juggling global players to boost competitiveness . #% The Commissioner will agree that the Cape Town Declaration agreed by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly earlier this year gives us a strong opportunity for parliamentarians and civil society more generally to play a far greater role in the discussions that these crucial negotiations entail . #% As Members of the European Parliament , we have a responsibility to ensure that the citizens of the European Union continue to enjoy the right to protest peacefully . #% Two accidents have focused our attention over the last ten days . #% He writes with passion and knowledge about the problem , because he understands what needs to be done , because he is not afraid to pinpoint failings in his own country , and because he cares . #% People could go back and search for different reasons why there are numbers of people there . #% There can be no going back on any particular substances , despite some pleading to do so . #% The progress we achieved is in large part thanks to the formidable effort and attention to detail the rapporteur put in to this . #% I want to refer to one of those trades and that is the trade that takes place in adoption . #% Will we see nitrofuran residues and hormones entering the EU in this cooked meat ? #% It seems to me that , in the European Union of 25 , implementation enforcement should get far higher priority than it has up until now . #% Perhaps then common sense can prevail once again within the European Commission . #% With some 600 initiatives , of which almost 200 are legislative measures , there is a lot of work to be done on scrutiny and on setting our own priorities , which we look forward to doing . #% Then comes the hard bargaining during conciliation as to where the money will come from . #% Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles ! #% What can one say in 90 seconds or even in 90 minutes , Mr Prodi , that would justify to the people of Europe your appointment and that of your Commissioners ? #% I wish to begin by thanking colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , especially the shadow rapporteurs for their important input . #% The new Commission will obviously study them closely . #% We have consistently championed the cause of greater transparency , openness and accountability but this is a separate matter from calling for the precedence of the Community method in every area of European Union decision-making . #% He has to be supportive of the European Union , or at least seem to be so . #% We have achieved the inclusion of a requirement for a report on overall system adequacy for operational network security for the projected security balance of supply and demand over the next five years and prospects for the security of electricity supply over the next 15 years beyond that , thereby flagging up what investment requirements will be needed . #% The E.P.L.P believes that although a single market for products purchased by individuals is essential , other issues affect decisions over excise duty charges . #% We know that the Member States are unable to reliably distinguish which consignments are eligible and which are not . #% When we are dealing with huge social upheaval we must also look at the costs . #% Of course there are direct flights , but it was not just in that particular website 's domain to issue them . #% The problems in Côte d'Ivoire will never be resolved until property rights and other demands are addressed . #% I have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but I have objections to what I take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the Hemicycle . #% The programme which was launched in 2001 has produced some very important and impressive results . #% I want to take the opportunity to say to the House tonight that I , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , have made a proposal to other committees and to the Commission on ways in which Parliament can exercise its political role in scrutinising and putting forward ideas for motor vehicle regulation . #% Are we going to see an action plan on future defence industries and on defence procurement , and are we going to see the Commission using the instruments it has available ? #% in writing . - While I support the main thrust of this report , I oppose the lack of balance on the particular question of Cyprus . #% The dilemma before us today is not over matters of opinion but over matters of intrusion and what happens when people invade the space of others , bringing despair and threatening behaviour to their activities . #% We hope the Commission will pressure European business operating in China to set an example by giving their own workers full trade union rights . #% This is not normal legislation , but an intensely political debate that requires an intensely political and cooperative approach between the institutions . #% We now finally have a European Union which is Europe-wide . #% You are the author of a disgraceful attempt to con the Irish into voting for this Lisbon Treaty in their forthcoming referendum . #% I am bound to remark , as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , that the decision that our committee should undertake this work , much contested by colleagues in other committees , has been more than amply borne out in the practical and pragmatic response that we have had , and I think we have a workable proposal . #% Perhaps the Commissioner could take back the message that the penalty for Commissioner Verheugen is to speed up the process even more . #% I can see a real need for improvement : they are complex and confusing . #% Leopards do not change their spots . #% But certainly the composition of this Parliament is very different and I would expect its conclusions to be different . #% That is a significant step forward . #% I have raised it several times with the President before and also with the Quaestors . #% There are politicians in some of our Member States who would like to see the Commission broken up into a series of specialised agencies to undermine the supranational executive that we have . #% We would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Mr President , can I say first of all how much I regret that this will be the last plenary session attended by Mrs Iivari . #% 
The goodwill is there . #% Who ever heard of such nonsense : to suggest a project and then attempt a definition ? #% This report shows the sort of open and progressive contribution that she has made in her willingness to work with us . #% In light of this , it is a sound proposal to establish a development company which would effectively act as an arbiter between the partners of this project . #% We are wasting taxpayers ' money and we are not as efficient as we ought to be as elected representatives . #% I point out that the Commission 's methodology has taken full account of this but I look at their faces and still see a degree of scepticism . #% Do not worry , it is meaningless . #% The other area where serious concern exists is in respect of the rights of terrorist suspects . #% But I have to say that you are just about the only European Leader who really understands why the people of France and Holland voted ` no ' . #% Meanwhile Community assistance is , as this House will know , primarily delivered through the TACIS programme which is centrally managed from Brussels . #% in writing . - Conservative MEPs abstained on the final vote on the Mănescu report for the following reasons . #% That is the way forward ; it is not very expensive ; we have done it on cancer screening , starting with the Irish Presidency and continuing with the Austrian Presidency . #% It may not seem much of a decline , but not just the 10 new Member States but also Romania and Bulgaria will have to fit within that ceiling . #% As I asked in the question , what is the Council doing or what action is it considering to ensure that the decision is enforced and that consumers are helped and receive the rights to which they are clearly entitled , as proven by the ECJ ruling ? #% The problem with the 1972 convention is that while it banned production of biological weapons it contained no means of verifying whether they were being produced on the quiet . #% Similarly , potential changes in the nature of aquaculture may mean that different rules are needed for the future from those that fit its character today . #% Further , the failure to explore the possibility of joint decisions by the European Union enfeebles and discredits the Union and exposes the institution of the Presidency-in-Office to serious reproach . #% The big question for our Group , for me - and , I am sure , the big question for Parliament , when we vote - is how we can demand that our citizens wear seatbelts if we send confusing signals . #% A limited area , you might think , but indeed the areas flowing from it were very extensive indeed . #% However , all being well , what was a negative factor will soon have the reverse effect . #% They achieved a sustainable industry by care , not by chance . #% It would also be helpful -- and perhaps the Commissioner could confirm this -- if the invitations were accompanied by a draft of the proposals that will be discussed in June . #% One thing that this whole issue has brought about - if it was needed - is a great awareness that this is a very small planet upon which we live and that mankind is very capable , through its industrial practices , of changing our environment . #% It was clearly seen by the Ukrainians as a geographical nonsense and a signal to their government that they were much better off making their bed with the Russian bear . #% There is absolutely no question about that fact . #% Pakistan , our ally in the war on terrorism , should also be challenged on its role in this weapons programme , as it allegedly provided an exchange for North Korean missiles to weaponise its own nuclear bomb . #% Mr President , the issue of low-level sonar and marine life is one that Parliament has debated in the past . #% The first problem , in both reports , is the tendency to be too prescriptive and interfering in the detail of Member States ' criminal justice systems . #% I would advise Mr Lamberts that the best way to minimise tax evasion is to have simpler taxes and lower tax rates . #% So public opinion does not matter a damn , does it ? #% Indeed , as regards the effects upon human health that have occurred in terms of cancer and other sicknesses , much more could and should have been done . #% As a parliamentarian , therefore , I call upon my fellow parliamentarians - here and in our national parliaments too - to urge Kuwaiti parliamentarians to give women that right to vote and stand . #% That is the problem we are facing in Bhopal today , and we are facing it 20 years after that catastrophe , when so many people died . #% The elections in Bulgaria on 25 June produced an unclear result . #% I hope that the Commissioner for Development , Mr Michel , will stand firm and that , in the spirit of what you said about your interest in developing countries , you will give your support for new and additional money to cover the accompanying measures . #% The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest . #% That procedure was concluded last April -- in other words , even before the election of the present European Parliament . #% In another sense , if the Commission had succeeded in what it was trying to do , it could have been reallocated to trans-European networks , to research and development and to small and medium enterprises . #% The committee also wants to reiterate its support for continued financial assistance to NGO participation in much of the technical committee work of the Parliament and the Commission . #% Also , very importantly , there is the declaration by the Council and the Parliament on the issue of stateless citizens which states that ` the European Parliament and the Council request the Commission to bring forward proposals , in the framework of the revision of Regulation ( EC ) No 539/2001 , in order to exempt holders of aliens ' and non-citizens ' passports residing in a Member State from the visa obligation ' . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his very careful reply and , although I am taking Italian lessons , I appreciate the fact that he gave it in his very good English . #% Mr President , I hope there will be a great football match on 17 June between England and Germany . #% There is no choice . #% I was pleased to hear that we have had a simulation exercise . #% One of the problems with funding of this type , as was found when it was used in Spanish waters , is that it is very difficult for the fishing boats , those tied up for the processing industry and others , to claim these funds . #% What they did , whether they knew it or not , was to recreate the very evil system that the people in Eastern Europe had lived under before . #% Africa is falling deeper into mass illiteracy and poverty and being further marginalised from mainstream developments in the economic and democratic fields . #% Today we have a map for the road but no one in the car . #% They should be able to register their product for simple and cost-effective evaluation . #% The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed , but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing . #% Perhaps more action could be taken at European level to help improve the flow of information . #% It is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account . #% I am going to focus on the third question , which is : what strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive ? #% This is an issue of extreme importance to Members of this Parliament and , if we are re-elected , we will keep pushing it forward . #% We are sadly all too familiar with the high figures of road accidents across Europe . #% Cambodia , which suffered enormously under blanket bombing during the war and indescribable , murderous Khmer Rouge brutality , is now sadly suffering increasing authoritarian rule by Prime Minister Hun Sen , who has arrested and issued defamation suits against critics who accuse him of selling territory to Vietnam in recent border negotiations as a way , of course , of silencing the political opposition in Cambodia . #% As is increasingly the case , it has been UK Conservatives setting the agenda . #% Equality is a hallmark of our progressive society in Europe , and I believe in fact that the legal safeguards and individual rights guaranteed by the EU acted as a kind of magnet to countries such as Lithuania as they emerged from communist totalitarian domination . #% Here I am talking about care services which I think you will agree with me are very often a fundamental matter in accommodating women returning to work . #% Four million people are HIV-infected in that country and the South African Government believes it has a constitutional duty to do this . #% What amounts do we need ? #% But we want to make sure that the currency we are creating is a citizens ' currency ; something that the people in the European Union feel confident with and feel is acting on their behalf . #% Mr Bowe and I , as British Members of the European Parliament , were faced with lobbies from Britain basically saying that if we adopted the Parliament 's amendments , the British coal mines which are still in production would all have to close down . #% At the same time the ELDR has resisted all attempts to burden this report with a shopping list of sector-specific requests . #% Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 . #% I welcome a new action plan for the Northern Dimension which will embrace three new Baltic states and Poland as EU members in 2004 , Russia , with which I support a privileged status in a common economic space one day , and the EEA states of Iceland and Norway . #% 
When the implementation date for the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics was postponed to 30 June 2002 by Directive 2000/41 , this postponement was to be - to quote the words of Recital 10 - for the ` last time ' . #% The costs are nothing compared to the economic benefits that will flow from enlargement . #% Firstly , there is the need for more effective action against organised crime , fraud and corruption . #% Mr President , I welcome our Commissioner , Mr Byrne . #% At the moment the death toll is at 26 but is expected to rise - maybe even to double that - and there are many people seriously injured . #% I understand that the PPE-DE is opposed to that amendment . #% Certainly the EU will have to target support from the TACIS programme better and consider opening other EU programmes up to Russia if it is to have an impact on the problems facing that country . #% The release of a further EUR 150 million in European Union aid will require the support of this House . #% Our sailors and traders devastated the Arctic environment in the 17th and 18th centuries with the so-called ` rape of Spitsbergen ' . #% The original request was both highly illogical and unrealistic . #% We all want to reduce our reliance on chemicals in agriculture but I regret that this report does not give us the solutions we want . #% It is therefore welcome that , as I said before , no such measures will be introduced . #% In the space of a few hours on the penultimate day of talks , there was a sudden shift on two problems on which there had seemed to be permanent stalemate . #% Where is the evidence that they are unsafe ? #% Long-term British residents from non-EU countries , from the Commonwealth for example , will now receive guaranteed equal access to education , health care and other benefits on the Continent . #% All through those grim years we in Britain never forgot Poland , nor did we ever lose our conviction that democracy and freedom would ultimately prevail and that Poland would once again take its honoured place in the European family . #% Parliament has been waiting for this for an enormous amount of time and I warmly thank my colleagues for their persistent efforts to see it brought forward . #% Indeed , only yesterday the U2 spy planes that he gave concessions for were grounded . #% Whether we like it or not , European citizens are voting with their wallets and buying imported footwear . #% Firstly , the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism , and amendments have strengthened that aspect . #% We need new dialogue with the Arab world to support UN resolutions and recognise not just election results but also their consequences . #% There are not many of us here , but I hope that the answer given by Mr Byrne , our Commissioner , will be widely read . #% So before we get smug in our concern for just certain groups , what about sparing a thought for those others who carry out emergency health care at all times and are also derogated from certain aspects of the working time directive . #% So I am consistent with what is in Parliament 's position up to now , and , indeed , in our own Rules of Procedure , where we have called upon the President of Parliament to ask the Commission to withdraw or modify any implementing measure that Parliament objects to , or to bring forward a legislative proposal . #% We must make the UN and its international human rights conventions a contractual obligation of the stabilisation , association and accession process , starting with ourselves . #% The over-prescriptive references to ` gender mainstreaming ' , ` gender-based budgeting ' and the call for rigid enforcement of quota systems are examples of this . #% An effective regulator must be close to and must understand the markets it regulates . #% I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here ! #% I welcome the fact that this directive will lower the exposure limit values for asbestos . #% It is evident that there will be no spending before June of next year , that is until after the elections take place . #% But while the equipment did not work , I felt severely handicapped . #% I commend the Evans and Wibe reports to the House . #% We need to spend at least as much time talking about the underpinnings of democracy and justice in all our Member States , through mutually constructive evaluation . #% As Mr Duisenberg will remember , Parliament has repeatedly adopted a transparency package advocating five separate measures to increase transparency . #% Mr President , first , may I apologise to the House for missing much of this debate , but unfortunately I had to be present at the STOA Panel to vote to try and prevent the suppression of a scientific report at the behest of Europe 's chocolate multinationals on inedibles in food . #% We will be supporting all of the amendments to the effect that bank guarantees behind venture capital are still far too strict , far too conservative and actually prevent entrepreneurs from creating jobs in the UK and in other European countries . #% We in this Parliament want to ensure the quality of these experiences and the quality of the validation . #% I have three specific points I want to raise in the context of the debate . #% I can tell you that those people I represent in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight certainly endorse that demand . #% Mr President , I rather object to the efforts made earlier by the Spanish left to make political capital out of Gibraltar on the back of the tragedy of the Kursk . #% Mr President , I find myself in agreement with Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarmingly for both of us - with Mr Bowe . #% I would like to know from the Commission what investigations have been done into offering protection that women can use , the drugs which can be used to protect women , and are we working with pharmaceutical industries to do that ? #% The experiments carried out so far under the auspices of COSAC show a great disparity between national parliaments in their approach to the subsidiarity question . #% We need to move towards world market prices by progressively reducing direct payments , we need to end quotas and make sure that the annual budget actually starts to reduce . #% Europe is one of the major consumers of the fur pelt trade - something like 70 % of which ends up within the European Union . #% The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms . #% Whenever a hollow-bore needle is used on a patient there is a risk of a needle-stick injury that could lead to a serious infection of a healthcare worker because the hollow-bore acts as a reservoir for the patient 's blood or other body fluids . #% I agree that they represent a damning indictment of the management of the Structural , Cohesion and ISPA Funds . #% Until we are prepared to give health concerns a major place in transport strategy , our children will go on paying for our inaction with their health , and increasingly with their lives . #% We need to invest money , time and effort in our systems of democracy and justice throughout the European Union . #% It is extraordinary that the plenary part-session should allow these appalling ethnic clashes last week in Gujerat to pass unremarked . #% It originated because of the difficult and expensive business of making international financial transfers . #% With regard to the infringement proceedings , I do not share the opinion that the infringement proceeding process is being abused by the Commission . #% Taking my own constituency , for instance , and the current issue of broadband , letters are flooding into my office from constituents in rural areas who complain that broadband is available in certain cities , but not for them . #% All of us want a strong United Nations . #% You will have noticed that the British Conservatives actually managed to persuade a number of different delegations in this House to get a majority against some of the proposals . #% Thank you very much for that full , helpful and informative reply . #% Mr President , this debate is about strategic priorities . #% This caused great hilarity in the House at the time . #% That is what we should be doing : uniting the people . #% The principles that have been established , especially around the specificity of sport , are extremely important . #% Unfortunately , the Commission 's report did not really detail any concrete progress made by the Commission in the five objectives set out . #% It is not the Italian presidency 's fault ; it is a long-standing problem involving all Councils . #% However , it is not just we who worked on this , but all the members of our committee , and others as well . #% If the rural pillar of the CAP is to become a reality we need some continued form of the LEADER programme after 2000 to maintain thriving rural communities , particularly in areas no longer covered either by Objective 1 or Objective 5 ( b ) after 1999 . #% Will the Council do anything to promote well-ordered international labour migration and , in turn , encourage EU Member States to set up mechanisms and provide incentives so that the expertise and experience gained by the service providers from the developing countries and LDCs can be applied in developing countries with under-serviced regions ? #% 
The suffering and agony of the Sudanese people demands a renewed and much more determined international effort on their behalf . #% We have got ourselves into a mess and every repressive measure risks making matters worse . #% I had to fight my way through teargas to gain access to the building . #% The final clause of Article 2 is slightly cryptic , and questions will arise about its meaning . #% in writing . - The ECR Group is very much in favour of EU enlargement . #% That is a matter for the Convention . #% Many of you know that I was rapporteur for Parliament 's position on this . #% This solution would be justifiable for one year only , but may provide a kind of bridge that would ensure the continuity the honourable Member seeks . #% A stimulating framework is required for us to promote high-growth industries such as information and biotechnologies and from that the jobs that must come . #% We want to turn ` can make an appeal ' into ` insist that an appeal is made ' . #% The resolution also calls for a much-needed discussion on new ways to finance the EU , which could reduce the cost of the EU for British taxpayers . #% Fortunately , the young are more cynical and I salute the courage of all those who have taken to the streets in protest and faced the brutality and the wrath of the militia and the KGB under Mr Lukashenko . #% After Commissioner Verheugen 's quite disgraceful attempts even to undermine the position taken by the British Presidency , we are entitled to believe that the balance in the Commission is now firmly anti-environment . #% If we did that we would save a considerable amount of money . #% Migration tests for phthalates are currently under development and will probably be available within months . #% Could he make plain his predilections in this area , especially as yesterday 's FT report on the uncertainty of monetary aggregate statistics cast doubt on whether we need to worry about their sharp growth ? #% There was no going Dutch with this Dutchman . #% Ordnance Survey has been in existence for 215 years and has a long and distinguished record . #% There are poorer conditions for Roma people , fewer facilities , nowhere near the same number of opportunities and generally they are far more alienated from society , for example in schools where there was no evidence of mother-tongue teaching , no evidence of any Roma teachers at all . #% We have found ourselves split between countries , within countries , within delegations , often with strongly held views . #% On behalf of the Socialist Group I should like to say that we are certainly in favour of the development of this new science of biotechnology . #% Later , he moved into Kuwait , with the results that we all know so well and into the north of Iraq , where he chemically bombed the northern Iraqis . #% The Labour Group has supported the work undertaken by the rapporteur and services of Parliament to ensure that the European Parliament maintains its legal/political powers . #% What really comes out of this is that we really need greater enforcement and greater political will to enforce amongst all Member States . #% We call on the Commission and the Council to continue to put pressure on all these countries to alleviate the human rights problems , which are different , but still exist in all three countries . #% Realistically , can we , in the short time available , make progress on ending dumping , on confirmation of the developing countries ' rights to protect their farms , their infant industries and services ? #% The work of the Council of Europe 's rapporteur on the subject supports that conclusion . #% As one personally associated in 1969 with the effects of the Torrey Canyon disaster on the beaches and livelihoods of south-west England , I have understood and shared that concern for many years . #% I would like to congratulate Mr Menrad on an excellent report . #% But we have now got ourselves into a position where everybody is throwing up their arms in horror at the enormous difficulties , and that is before we have even started the negotiations . #% We must put pressure on all Member State governments to integrate asylum policy , and indeed immigration considerations , into all policy areas as a horizontal policy objective . #% I suspect that similar letters could be obtained from Estonia and Sweden to start off with . #% They may be a bad constitution , they may not be very well codified , they may have all sorts of articles that people have forgotten about , but nonetheless they are the constitution . #% I welcome the President-in-Office 's statement that at the next conciliation he hopes we can get an agreement with the Council . #% In addition , extremely worrying and as yet unquantifiable concerns exist about the possible creation of new forms of allergy in foods caused by the transfer of genetic information from other species into species commonly used as foods . #% For those donors the motivation is money , not the health and quality of life the recipients can expect . #% It would be nice if they were in more user-friendly form , for example , on CD-ROM , but there is progress . #% From the outset we have been working to fulfil that purpose by modernising structures and systems , by focusing more directly on priorities , by making unprecedented provision for the allocation of individual responsibility at all levels and by prioritising the use of people and of financial resources . #% Just let us get on with it , because if you do not , more and more businesses are going to go to Dubai , Bermuda and the Channel Islands - I am moving half my business to the Channel Islands as it is . #% This sits alongside measures on prevention . #% There has been a phenomenal reduction in jobs in the defence industries as well as in research and development . #% The need to regulate could be disproportionate to any potential threat such funds are perceived to have . #% I regret to say I find that a rather thin answer . #% When I wrote the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the Commission Green Paper on food legislation , this concern was reflected in the fact that not only was there no opposition to my proposal that antibiotics should only be used to treat illness in animals and not routinely as a prophylactic , but the wording was actually strengthened in the committee . #% This is what today 's debate is about and we must not confuse the issues . #% To Mr Ferber I would say : it is a matter of record that my promise at the outset of the Commission - and I am not trying to denounce or go back on any catchphrases about the best in the world , etc. was that we would strive to achieve , through radical modernising reform , a well managed , high-performance , service-orientated , independent European Commission in the service of the peoples of the European Union . #% If no vote was taken , we can not have a definitive report . #% These are of course the returns after deducting all losses . #% Earlier this year , we saw international pressure helping to put a stop to plans to stone Safiya Husseini to death . #% However , we were unable to support the joint motion for a resolution because it undermines the cause of tolerance by arbitrarily listing specific incidents and specific events and organisations . #% The fourth issue is in relation to the stability pact . #% We should remember the strategic vulnerability of Israel , a tiny country whose people have been subjected to the most terrible terrorist attacks , at once unpredictable and random while organised and planned in order to have the most cruel and devastating effect . #% Brian Simpson 's excellent report recognizes that postal services are , and must be , a vital , regulated part of the European single market and that national post offices should provide high quality postal services to promote easy postal communication for consumers and for businesses . #% Madam President , this summit was highly significant and its outcome better , less repressive , than expected . #% Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected . #% In the case of the Arroni report on the practical aspects of the euro , there is common agreement on most items , including the need to encourage Member States to publish changeover plans and , more excitingly , to publish the euro designs of the national face of coins . #% This new statute has to be implemented consistently and we have to make sure that courts in Member States who will be responsible for this have the training and ability to do so . #% That is what we must focus on . #% If the people objecting now really cared about racism , they would have come to the committee meetings and put down amendments . #% It equally implies that security at all extra-EU airports are inferior to the worst EU airport . #% It places a clear prohibition on the commission of , or support for , acts of terrorism . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to welcome the statements from the previous speaker on a debriefing from the Council and the Commission following the UN hearing . #% I welcome that answer . #% A single area payment is in line with the view that growers should respond to market demands rather than be driven by CAP subsidies . #% Insisting on the ruthless enforcement of its rules in a year 's time from the comfort of an armchair may give the speaker a great feeling of satisfaction , but it could seriously jeopardise the long-term health of the British egg sector . #% Much of this flooding happened in my region , and I can testify to the appalling damage and hardship which it brought on many residents of my area . #% 
I certainly would be very concerned if , later next year , we had a very serious grain shortage . #% Questions are asked specifically on the subjects on which we want information . #% Sadly , Western concepts of human rights are less developed in Malaysia . #% Despite this resolution 's focus on immediate events in Burma , I urge the Council and Commission also to give due consideration to how best to support Burma when it is finally free and democratic once again . #% This means that we would support the majority of the actions proposed in the report to assist the industry to adapt to meet this competition . #% This is hypocrisy in its saddest form . #% Secondly , the electoral process to enable those former belligerents to join the democratic process remains fragile , as the three days of fighting in the Congo following the publication of the preliminary first-round results demonstrates . #% Can the Commissioner tell us whether he feels this subsidy will help or will hinder the agreement of an OECD deal with the United States and our other partners ? #% I can not understand why it is less important for these workers to have reasonable working conditions and hours than any other group of health workers . #% As Mrs Buitenweg said , the presidency has also been good today , even in the videoconference on the European Solidarity Fund . #% Madam President , I wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur for her important work on this key industrial sector in the European Union . #% The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has now developed an effective system of standing committees , firing on all cylinders and getting members working together . #% Let us gaze on the sunlit uplands of the euro which beckon ever more strongly . #% This is not , in turn , to challenge the right of claimants to make appeals . #% It is necessary to reform the sugar market in order bring it in line with CAP reform . #% However , I still remain to be convinced that certain proposals can be enforced and understood . #% The Council , however , were not prepared to accept them in the body of the text . #% They would be able to say to others : look - you can not do it , you are at fault . #% It rather implies that Turkey is not very welcome . #% The idea that we should just have one review and that is the end of it , as originally intended , is simply nonsense . #% We all know about the well-publicised cases of Tamil action against government forces . #% That matter is also being considered in so far as the overall public health situation is concerned . #% I asked a question at that time : is this facility open to other members ? #% We must help Europe rediscover its drive towards economic growth and competitiveness , ruthlessly cutting out waste and bureaucracy and concentrating on the prerequisites for that agenda . #% The intent is to be able to release these sums by the end of the year on second reading , so long as we can have a satisfactory explanation from the Commission on 15 November , when we will have a joint Committee on Budgets-Committee on Budgetary Control meeting to examine these lines and to see whether they are now operating positively . #% They will really help them engage with this new revolution . #% Does this means the Commission is intending to extend the trade in nuclear materials beyond the boundaries of the European Union ? #% Therefore , what interim measures can he propose which would make it possible for a temporary lifting of the ban , up to the point where this can be settled between the two governments in an amicable manner ? #% We welcome a new drive to improve the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , including a Security Council resolution to close loopholes in the existing legal framework . #% The fact is that the Commission has the sole right to propose the kind of legislation that is damaging Europe 's economies in the way that it is . #% Although we are against Turkish accession , we shall be quite happy to watch the EU destroy itself while trying to achieve it . #% We have squeezed out some amendments to that effect in this report and I think that was right . #% The most likely form of increased international presence on the ground is a resuscitation of the liaison between the Israeli and Palestinian security services reinforced by American and European elements . #% What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola , eating hamburgers , wearing baseball caps , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time . #% It rather bluntly stated that the European Union would have the power to extend for the first time anti-dumping disciplines from the trade in goods to the trade in services , without a great deal of detail about how that would take place . #% I thank Mrs Doyle for her work . #% Who is speaking for the United Kingdom Presidency , Mr Prescott , the President-in-Office present today or the President-in-Office of the Economic and Finance Ministers ? #% Mr President , as you will be aware , the debate on this report only concluded just before the vote . #% So it may be unfortunate that some people who have chosen particular political parties get labelled in that way but it is their own ultimate responsibility . #% I would like to congratulate it on putting a higher priority on delivering what we have , on enforcing the measures in the single market , on improving mutual recognition , which I agree with the Commission is entirely at the foundation and the heart of the single market project . #% Insurance services , for example , are particularly suited to e-commerce provision . #% The EU should redouble its efforts to expedite that process in every way possible . #% I refer to the vote on the amendment by Mr Elles . #% So heaven help our truckers ! #% Now it is time to focus due scrutiny on the actions of our security forces , reining them back to the fold of governmental control so that we can guarantee Community security for the whole of the European Union , preserving the rule of law and our democratic institutions . #% However , the record will show that I said we had a care of duty - a responsibility - to the 110 000 jobs . #% I pay tribute to the way he has skilfully steered this report through Parliament , embracing as many opinions as possible and reaching a conclusion which will be endorsed overwhelmingly in Parliament tomorrow . #% Parliament supports the common objective of Bulgaria 's accession to the EU on 1 January 2007 , provided that certain matters of serious concern are dealt with . #% Bulgaria has made great strides in recent years . #% It is the Israelis who should be responsible for keeping one and a half million people alive . #% I do not want the power of the British Parliament to change the way we decide to protect human rights to be undermined . #% Other vital public services , such as the NHS , emergency services , DSS , Post Office and railways , are not far behind . #% I also wish to congratulate the tyre manufacturers , because over the years they have improved road safety , the availability of tyres and also the tread and the capacity of the tyre to stick to the road . #% The Directive on European Works Councils after all is rather too limiting for any progress to be made . #% We are deeply concerned at the implications for non-refoulement , particularly as we are also witnessing an attack on Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which deals with the issue of not returning people to a situation in which they might face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the programme and priorities of the Belgian presidency in the employment and social field . #% It is about free movement for people and freedom to live their lives as they wish : a free market for people , a common market for EU citizens and their families . #% Mr Kirkhope , who is no longer in the Chamber , said that politics should not enter the work of the agency . #% Can he not be more precise in the best interests of our relations with Slovakia ? #% Although it contains some interesting ideas about the structure of hearings in the Parliament , it only proposes to give the European Parliament consultative status . #% It is great to have a German Conservative I can agree with , even if I can not agree with my British Conservative colleagues . #% If they are beyond you , you are in a downward spiral to poverty and , more often than not , to death . #% The whole thrust of the proposal is to protect workers engaged in those activities and repair work , which will bring workers into contact with asbestos locked up in the built environment for many years to come . #% If I could ask for a Christmas present given that I still believe in Father Christmas I should like to see IGC conclusions which are agreed upon , which are upheld and which leave no leftovers . #% The really good news though is that British business is waking up to the fact that the innocuous-sounding common market was actually always intended to be far more than that , and British businesses are saying : we do not need the European Union , we would be better off making our own trade deals . #% We need more international agreements like this and we need speed . #% 
I hope that is so . #% But this girl , who is now 13 , has no nationality and only a temporary travel document issued as a concession by the Irish authorities . #% EU cultural attachés will simply mean more highly paid non-jobs for favoured EU civil servants paid for by the contributing countries . #% The time has come for us to say that we must do something to encourage people to live with their children ; to make it clear that all children have the right to two parents who love them from birth right through to adulthood . #% I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on . #% They came up with an alternative text but , I am sorry to say , the Council has never had the courtesy to inform Parliament of the new version of the text . #% Furthermore , the remit of the Authority should be extended to include animal health and welfare , plant health , GMOs and food labelling . #% My third and last point is to say that the national self-regulatory bodies need to coordinate their work . #% We have put in an amendment to paragraph 39 since , as far as I can see , there simply was no G2 leaders ' agreement to work on a financial transaction or Tobin tax , so it is absurd to welcome such an agreement , even if we have already done so , erroneously , in the G20 resolution . #% Meanwhile , I encourage the Commission to respond to those issues raised in this report and to reply as fully as possible . #% If I remember correctly it was the Commission that proposed it as a way out of the impasse . #% It is important that progress be made on that . #% We went to fight an election , came back after a time and found this still on our plates and it is quite remarkable that we have managed to deal with it so quickly . #% Reports of personal injuries are all the more alarming . #% I like the scope and the potential day-to-day impact of the programme and the report , and I wholeheartedly commend them , with the predictable caveat on budgets . #% With the greatest respect to Mrs Wulf-Mathies , even if we can not guarantee such a close relationship today between Parliament and the Commission , we thank her and congratulate her on the very important work being achieved in this programme . #% Time and again the EU has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of technological innovation and is sorely lagging behind its American counterparts in this field . #% I know they are having to streamline the administrative process related to conglomerates with third-country parents . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Hoppenstedt for an excellent report and response to what I believe to be an excellent document from the European Commission . #% The British Labour Government puts crime at the top of its agenda , and is reducing violent crime and disorder . #% His deceit has left successive British governments to cope with the consequences and we have gradually come to see the EU for what it really is . #% It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers ' money is to be spent on this project . #% I would also urge publishing the minutes and the voting patterns of the Governing Council , as winning the trust and the confidence of the markets is vital , especially for such a young institution . #% I am glad that the amendments adopted at committee removed some of the mild criticism of the British and Irish position which was agreed at Amsterdam as regards non-participation , for a period at any rate , in the Schengen agreement . #% Following on from that , will the Commission use any legal powers at its disposal to ensure compliance with Community law ? #% Undoubtedly , Parliament was flexing its muscles and keen to make a show of its new powers under the Lisbon Treaty , but the temporary demise of the SWIFT accord until the better current proposal was forthcoming from the Commission could perhaps ultimately be for the good , to serve as a wake-up call to President Obama 's Administration which , like its predecessors , appears to have a very sketchy grasp of the EU and its institutions , notably Parliament . #% I suggest that this is happening with tax , in the numerous different tax initiatives and ways in which the European Commission and the European Union are seeking to enlarge their competence over areas of tax . #% On both of those points , it is clear that the report has already had an influence on the shift in public policy which is starting in the United Kingdom . #% Nor do we believe that the Commission needs a seat on the ICAO Assembly . #% Mr Cabrol has pursued his extra proposals with his usual vigour and diligence . #% How do we justify interference in the private market on such a scale -- interference and the setting of standards that go far beyond health and safety requirements ? #% The economic situation in that country has sharply worsened , with the GDP falling 40 % over the last 4 years , and with inflation already at 600 % and forecast to reach 1000 % before the end of 2004 . #% If a constructive relationship with the EU and international pressure can bring Ariel Sharon from his early political career to the legacy he has given to Kadima , this surely proves that positive engagement can shift seemingly zero-sum mentalities . #% I really was quite alarmed a moment ago that I was actually agreeing with one or two bits of his speech , and I was only saved by the fact that in his final remarks I was able to be totally opposed to him again . #% As the notes in front of you say there was a mistake by the services and in fact the wording that was put in by both the PPE and ourselves was not reflected in what was printed . #% The EU suggests going beyond the and overriding due process in the event of special circumstances . #% That would be particularly helpful . #% In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities . #% Therefore , we must observe what others do and learn from each other , taking and adapting from each other what suits best . #% The cost of inspection within the EU and fees charged to each feed company have to be looked at , because if one country is charging significantly more for inspections than another , it causes distortions throughout the single market . #% We do need to have certain sanctions ready for use if the deadline of 22 November set by the Commonwealth and the UN is not observed and we do not see President Musharraf stand down as military leader or , indeed , an end to the state of emergency . #% Finally , Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations . #% Transparency and openness is another issue for the Presidency . #% We should apply the terms of the 1951 Convention on Refugees , which requires them to seek sanctuary in the first designated safe country they come to - which is not a little island off the coast of Europe called Britain . #% And it is patronising and insulting to treat Turkey differently from other candidates as if suggesting Turkey is second class and incapable of aspiring to European political standards . #% High subsidies for high-quality programmes that nobody watches is not a sensible way to spend our money . #% It will be an important point in Europe 's history . #% Animal welfare is also extremely important . #% I trust that Parliament will give its full support to the report and that the Commission and Council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends . #% I suspect that most of all , the German taxpayer will not put up with this expensive charade for very much longer . #% It is true that developing countries ' economies could receive a huge boost for a more open trading regime , but this is not automatic and not without its problems . #% Nevertheless , the exception for safety is again welcome provided it is indeed for safety alone . #% He spoke about possible membership of the European Union . #% in writing . - I am proud to have voted for the extension of maternity rights and condemn Conservative and Liberal Democrat MEPs who first conspired to obstruct parliamentary agreement of this directive and today voted to deny decent rights to working women . #% This interinstitutional agreement takes us one step further in another direction with the obligation it would place on all Members and staff to use the proper procedures to inform the future office , the OLAF office , so that any allegations of fraud can be properly investigated . #% We need some clarification , certainly from the Commission , on those lines which were considered to be problematic . #% Mr President , Iran is a large and important country with an ancient tradition of culture and learning going back to the pre-Islamic Zoroastrian period . #% Vice-President , thank you for giving me the floor . #% Also , in my opinion , there must be overwhelming concern and action to preserve fishing stocks so that we have a sustainable fishing policy . #% We will have monetary union on 1 January 1999 but many of us do not believe that we will have economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999 . #% I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees . #% The legal base for the principle involved has been in the Treaties since the Treaty of Maastricht , signed by all our Member States , ratified by all national parliaments . #% Nevertheless , I am critical of China 's inhumane treatment of North Korean refugees , who are sent back to face torture or even execution . #% It may be that it needs to be continued but at the same time we also need to be helping the Indonesians by providing them with assistance to ensure that very fragile democracy elected in the last general election is able to establish itself . #% As I read on in the Laeken Declaration I recall the saying we have in English that , like the curate 's egg , it is good in parts . #% In conclusion , as travel demand increases , the number of aircraft increase , the number of risks increase , it is vital that safety standards throughout the Community are harmonized . #% 
It is not a question of protecting EU trade , of protecting EU jobs ; it surely is a question of protecting the consumer across the world . #% In a very important report there was a substantial debate in committee and the most substantial part of the debate , as far as I was concerned , was about the use of the words ` European public prosecutor ' . #% The production line was invented about a hundred years ago , I believe , by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them . #% But if we were looking at the world properly , all our summits would be about sustainability . #% It is not enough to threaten . #% If we continue to invoke it when there is no prime facie risk at all , we make both the precautionary principle and ourselves look ridiculous . #% As far as the role of the European Parliament is concerned , we are beginning to find an increasing number of forms and areas of cooperation in which Parliament is not fully involved . #% Mr President , I am glad that my colleague in the PPE-DE Group has now come round to the view that I put to him yesterday . #% As my colleagues have said , we need to look at the ageing population to ensure that ageing is an opportunity , and not just a burden . #% I should like to air one or two things which have already been said . #% That would leave them without cover until the age of 65 , when their entitlement would become about EUR 500 per month . #% Mr President , it has recently been brought to my attention that the Maltese Labour Party has submitted up to 1 600 petitions to the Constitutional Court in Malta , the effect of which is to disbar Maltese citizens temporarily abroad for work or study from voting in the coming European elections . #% I would like to make it clear that the Quaestors were not consulted about this change . #% That is why within both these agreements we are tabling amendments that say that the fishing fleets , the vessels and the owners themselves who benefit from these agreements should pay the full cost of these agreements , and that they should no longer rest on the taxpayers of the EU - not because that is bad in itself but because through subsidy we have overcapitalization and continued depletion of stocks . #% Political and civil freedom , as has been mentioned , can not be separated from economic success . #% That is something we find unacceptable . #% But your activism in this matter has already created positive developments , both within and beyond the EU . #% Mr President , my name does not seem to be on yesterday 's attendance list although I did actually sign in . #% However , one has to express a note of caution . #% I am delighted to say that Mr Cox is hosting a reception tomorrow evening for Members of Parliament and I hope that Mr Titley , among his other invitations for this week , will find the opportunity to attend that reception being offered by the President . #% I would have thought it is about time we took a couple of steps back and said that what we have in the European Union is an over-regulated model that is serving us very badly during the depths of a recession . #% The point of this exception is that a public body may , in carrying out its public duties , come into possession of information about the private and family life of individuals . #% Moreover , it is proposed to seek not only an annual report on a one-year programme but also quarterly reports on the application and implementation of the measures . #% Stoning for adultery is barbaric ; flogging for sex before marriage or alcohol consumption and amputation for theft may be considered excessive . #% Personally I hope that the prosecutions will not be restricted to the top 20 leaders but be extended to those who daily brutalised and executed their victims . #% The EU has not even been able to fulfil its meagre security obligations to Sudan , where it insisted on a role when NATO was already committed . #% Indeed , such is the desperation in Iran that opposition leader Mir Hossain Musavi , hardly known to be a democrat in the past , has said he is prepared to sacrifice his own life for the future good of his own country . #% The second point I want to make links in with our competitiveness . #% But it would still be better to vote it down than to give the wrong message that this Parliament is more concerned with trying to preserve the past than with helping employers and employees come to terms with the future . #% Let us hope , however , that the 12 May Summit will change all of this . #% Since we are dealing mainly with the northern hemisphere , would he not agree that it is rather silly to have the cutoff date half way through the trapping season ? #% Labour MEPs have therefore voted in favour of this report and remain supporters of the principles of family reunification . #% We should not lose sight of the benefits and potential of clean coal technology when we have this significant indigenous energy source . #% Denmark and Sweden apart , the United Kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole EU , way below the average EU rate . #% When Mr Cashman asks us to pursue best practice , he knows he is pushing at an open door . #% In particular , we had asked in the last Parliament , and indeed in previous Parliaments , for the Commission and Parliament offices to work closely together in the Member States . #% The stakes are high . #% This Parliament should then subsequently support the international legitimacy of the UN . #% Sanctions as originally proposed were unwise and would not have worked . #% The same would apply to a private company that is , in this respect , literally a law unto itself . #% But then , abdicating any responsibility for being vigilant and active , he concluded : ' I think we ought to take the view , particularly as between Western European countries and the United States , that here is a set of countries which take a pride in abiding by the rule of law and will honour their agreements . #% All Member States voted for the common position , but some made it clear that they would go very little further than that . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying to the Greek Presidency ` Efcharisto poli ' . #% Because it has been the product of a lot of constructive and detailed argument : long debates and votes in committee , because different sides want to reinforce their position , negotiation and compromise . #% I thank the Council for that very comprehensive response . #% There are approximately 20 million AK-47s in Africa , and any control we have over rifles in the European Union will make no difference . #% If the Commission doubts the need for Info-Points and the more effective information programme , let me draw attention to statistics in recent polls . #% A first-reading agreement , though it is not absolutely certain yet , is what we would like to see . #% We are , however , unhappy that Parliament supports a voluntary , as opposed to compulsory , 2 % increase in milk quotas . #% For me , both Romania and Bulgaria and for that matter , Turkey , could meet the criteria for membership of the EU . #% I am deeply concerned about some of the issues that have been raised in this meeting today . #% Parliament 's approach to ` toughen up ' the legislation in this field is very much welcomed . #% Firstly , how long will the Commission pursue the recommendations for good conduct , which Commissioner de Silguy has just described , before deciding whether they are effective or not and whether it needs to make mandatory provisions given the time for codecision and the 2002 deadline which means that we have to make some judgement on this well before 2002 ? #% Even Mr Špidla agreed with me on that to some degree a short while ago . #% Can the Commissioner reassure us that the Commission really is following up the landfill directive ? #% Yet I also have a healthy scepticism towards both the pharmaceutical industry and our exaggerated confidence in some of its products , many of which cause a great deal more harm than the illegal recreational drugs which attract the bulk of public attention . #% Across the country , 300 million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty , even if more than 100 million remain in the more remote rural areas living on less than EUR 1 per day . #% Lastly , we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 Council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment . #% Second , non-state actors provide pluralism , alternative views and alternative experiences to those of governments , views which are at best representative of grass-roots communities of marginalised people , who in turn are representative of those in greatest need . #% I hope the Commission will consider these in detail . #% The declarations made in Council have only just become available and I would criticize this delay . #% If we adopt this report we can start to establish minimum basic rights , as the Minister and the Commissioner have said , for refugees , for access to welfare , housing , education , health care - things that we in the privileged world take for granted . #% I felt that I needed to explain our position and say why the UK PSE will be voting against this report later today . #% Madam President , my group welcomes this excellent and important report and congratulates the rapporteur . #% We should take this chance now of providing for the peoples of Europe , represented by their national MPs and by their Members of the European Parliament , by establishing not a Convention , but a parliamentary conference . #% May I please ask the Commission to think very carefully about the merits of taking on board Amendment No 5 . #% 
Whilst there is , of course , a strong case for genuine asylum seekers applying through the usual routes , the influx of illegal immigrants being smuggled into British ports , often by people-trafficking gangs , is alarming . #% That is certainly the opinion of Commissioner Bjerregaard , so I endorse the idea . #% First of all , it is important that progress be made . #% Well , they see the planet 's resources being unevenly spread . #% In other words , the specification of the equipment may involve new technology evolutions . #% Whatever one 's view of the Iraqi conflict -- and there are different views in this House , in my country , and indeed in my party , and I have my own view on this -- it is essential that we debate this matter based on the facts , not on fiction . #% Mr President , there is no issue of greater importance for the future of the Union as we move to have over twenty Member States , as will be the case in the next few years , than the reform of the decision-taking procedures within the Council . #% These are massive tasks which the EU seeks to tackle in its proposed action plan . #% And yet the hard work she has put into it has made some progress towards a position that all the political groups can support . #% But let me reiterate why we did so . #% Information documents must become more available . #% At the moment we have a very confusing set of different rules and regulations and it is clear from complaints to many of us and to Parliament 's Petitions Committee that clear advice is not always forthcoming from the appropriate authorities , even in Member States themselves . #% Politicians have partly conspired to hide from the peoples of our Member States that implementing the Kyoto Protocols is going to be painful . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% It is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are . #% There are many people in my country who would say that the compromise does not go far enough to meet their concerns . #% At the moment when the whole question of democratic accountability in the EU is under discussion , it is time the Council took more notice of European Parliament resolutions . #% This initiative is , therefore , in my view , a step in the right direction with the use of modern computer image digitalising technology to aid law enforcement agencies and interior ministries to cooperate throughout the Union . #% Actually , patents are about protecting a genuine invention , a new way of doing something , something that is - as this directive says - susceptible of industrial application . #% Our efforts in Parliament during the first reading in particular have been to fill in some of the gaps , to make it a more usable and credible instrument , rather than a sort of blunderbuss threat which might arguably have been too crude to use at all . #% I hope that this report will have the full and deserved support of this House . #% That is what this legislation should address . #% For those other ` out ' countries , including my own , I very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon . #% First of all , security at airports and on aircraft ; secondly , the control of congested airspace in view of the likely increase in military activity , the dangers of hostile incursion into European civil airspace and , of course , as he said , about the continued viability of European airlines . #% We need to learn from this experience that the commitment needs to be full , well-planned and consistent and not half-hearted and under-funded . #% We must also ensure that disabled children and adults have access to sporting facilities . #% It seems to me that everybody is blaming everybody else . #% Finally , it is the right and duty of every citizen , elected or not , to use all peaceful avenues to try to uphold international law . #% The Council , up to now , has had an advantage in that the Treaty specifies that the Council or its representatives attend the conciliation meetings and in practice , when necessary , in cases where meetings have gone on longer than expected - as they often do in conciliation , with extra meetings called at short notice - the Council has been able to change its representatives . #% I agreed in discussions with the Socialist Group to alter that to `` an increase '' on the assumption that our Amendment No 40 would be the basis for our compromise . #% That is where I am coming from . #% In the Philippines the government has ruled that the minimum wage will no longer apply in the textiles sector . #% This initiative has yet to be implemented in the Member States . #% Secondly , we believe this process should be an inclusive one , that all countries in central and eastern Europe and Cyprus are in the pipeline to European Union membership , although they may be at different stages of that pipeline . #% It will be fundamentally our problem and our responsibility . #% The Commission must bring forward measures to develop alternative sources of income with a greater degree of urgency than it is currently showing . #% In three months , or even earlier , the UN force must be ready to deploy , because the AU will start to pull out . #% You can not simply preach to the converted as you did in the European School a few days ago . #% Finally , I would say that the first thing we have to try and do is to ensure that it is governments , rather than organised criminals , that determine where refugees finally end up . #% That is why I was determined to oppose those people in this Parliament and in the Council who wanted to weaken this Commission proposal . #% Madam President , as colleagues will recall , we adopted a resolution in my name in this House on the subject of EU-China relations in the long term just before the summer break . #% I fully support that particular point . #% At a time when Christmas is approaching , this offers one opportunity , among the multiplicity of human rights abuses globally , for Muslims and Christians to come together against the forces of evil . #% Finally , this UN reform results from the Millennium Review Summit and comes at a historic point in the defence of the principle of multilateralism in our world . #% If we do not do that we are going back to the kind of rhetoric that we have heard from one or two Members in this debate today . #% My second point is about the human health dimension , because although this obviously has an animal health issue at its starting point , the human health dimension is very important . #% We have to do it . #% I am pleased that in negotiation the Commission was able to overcome Member States ' resistance , make some progress and secure more ambitious targets . #% In many ways it is dishonest , because people will be buying engines which they think meet the regulations , when in fact they are dirtier . #% We in this House have become accustomed to the idea of externalities in environmental policy , with the bill for the costs of dirty practices being picked up not by the enterprise in question , but by society more broadly . #% The same applies to Article 11 of the Council decision . #% The notion of a computer aiding or controlling things is actually rather an outdated one . #% It is incredible to me that there are Parliament rules stating that there are no smoking areas yet we do not have a safe passage into this Chamber . #% In the UK we gave our neighbours in France , Ireland and in the Netherlands an early warning and they acted promptly . #% I would agree here with Mr McCartin . #% That assessment showed that even after the rationalisation efforts carried out in 1999 and 2000 there was a shortfall of 1 254 posts in relation to Commission staff members assigned to priority activities . #% The complementary systems consider first of all whether a person needs protection . #% I see he is smiling so perhaps he agrees with me . #% The industry would be very grateful for his confirmation that the proposals would not contravene any existing trade legislation . #% I agree that small businesses are important ; large multinationals have all the influence , but create jobs outside the EU . #% We are being presented with a vehicle filled with good intentions . #% As some of you may know , I have spent some time in the last few months , as rapporteur on the democracy initiative , going to the conference in Sana'a , Yemen , to Cairo , Alexandria , Damascus , to the Arab Parliamentary Union conference and to Athens last week with you , Mr President . #% Madam President , if the Germans have a problem with their driving licences , what is to stop the German Government from sorting it out ? #% The figures published in the new orientations document in July show the maximum yearly increase due to reform - if the measures were adopted by all institutions - would be EUR 34.3 million higher in 2005 than in 2001 . #% Indeed , several of us would argue in the current Commission that they are over-modest . #% I would like to ask , Mr President , whether you have yet received the French resignation . #% 
Many were left homeless , without spouses and with children to care for . #% That is something we shall address in the next communication . #% While I understand the legal basis of this , it is a fundamental principle that citizens of the European Union should be democratically represented within their institutions . #% I fear the answer to both questions is no . #% This resolution , should it be passed , will represent a formal contribution to the Convention from the parliamentary delegation . #% As Mr Whitehead has said , I have learnt , like he , a great deal more about ferrets than I knew a month ago . #% The EU remains deeply critical of the widespread atrocities in Chechnya , including the extrajudicial execution of Aslan Maskhadov . #% Mr President , will you at least pledge to back us in getting computers for MEPs , preferably flat-screen computers so we can fit them on to our desks in our tiny offices and be more efficient for the 21st century ? #% We would have preferred to have the original Commission proposal in its simplicity , but I recognise the considerable political difficulties which Mr Karas faced and thank him for his efforts in engineering that . #% Nevertheless , Kashmiri Pandits still continue to claim that cross-border infiltrating terrorists are attempting a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the local Hindu population , albeit it on a vastly reduced scale . #% We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and , indeed , some interesting implementation . #% All three cases involved prosecutions by the Italian authorities . #% I should like to ask those people who wanted to include military aircraft and military airfields within the scope of this directive , whether they are really saying , as Europe is , at the moment , in a state of war , that our airforces can not operate at night or with planes that are too noisy , that they can not defend our freedoms against terrorist attacks if their aircraft are too noisy . #% It is important for the EU to build up relations with such countries which lie in an important geopolitical region . #% We must take care that we do not allow extremists and terrorists to exploit our concern for human rights . #% Mr President , with your permission , I rise under Rule 141 to put a question to Mr Farage . #% The urgency of the matter should not in itself be an excuse for us to rush it through without proper discussion . #% It should not be permitted by this directive . #% A very hopeful development over the last few days has been the very moderate calls by people like Ahmed Türk and Osman Baydemir , the major of Diyarbakir , for an end to the violence and for political discussions . #% Well , there is a remarkable piece of underpromising and overdelivery ! #% It is equally clear that , in the increasingly intolerant atmosphere of Political Correctness that is permeating the Parliament , some MEPs are more equal than others . #% It is now , at last , beginning to get its own house in order with regional blocs and continent-wide supranational institutions committed to observing international human rights law , such as Economic Community of West Africa ( ECOWAS ) and the African Union . #% I welcome in this report the wider definition of ` family ' and the importance given to the consideration of humanitarian grounds in the application of this directive . #% Romania has suffered from Fascism under the Iron Guard and from Communism under Ceausescu . #% We pay millions of pounds for relaxation therapies and yet one of the best relaxation therapies of all is simply to take a day 's rest each week . #% But it is thanks to Parliament 's powers and the determination of our political group to use them that we have made progress on those three items so far . #% In these circumstances it really is not acceptable to justify the actions taken by the West by putting the blame just on Saddam Hussein - we all accept that . #% We shall be supporting the amendment to exempt music from the directive , an amendment originally conceived by my colleague Mr Pronk . #% It is important to have EU and national targets , but it is also important to have a European directive which will support efforts at local and regional level , where many of the decisions are actually taken . #% Belarus is now saddled with a paranoid , self-isolating dictator , Mr Lukashenko . #% At the next revision of the Treaty the matter could have been resolved entirely by the Council accepting the principle that colegislators could not only co-legislate on primary legislation but could be the co-legislators on other areas . #% I commend my colleague David Martin for his all too apposite report , which I will be supporting . #% When they are divided or make seemingly empty threats , sending different messages through other channels , then the tyrant sees no need to respond . #% The Commission has not previously called for the establishment of a single European air traffic control agency and the request in this report is superfluous . #% Europe uses 7 million litres per annum , and 4 million litres come from compensated donors . #% I hope that when Irish voters go to the polls later this year they will reject the Lisbon Treaty again . #% If we lay down guidelines , we will not leave it to the Commission to judge that and say : ` No , we are not answering that question or this question ' . #% This really is essential . #% We need to have subsidiarity here so that some countries may go ahead and continue to pay them . #% I want to say to you , Commissioner , that these regulations are exceptionally complex . #% If there were any evidence that the Council was deliberately holding back this regulation to give it greater leverage during the negotiations of the broader trade and development cooperation agreement , that indeed would be extremely worrying . #% Mr Putin is a friend of ours , and we should encourage him . #% A great many of our citizens regard the situation whereby we introduce anti-cancer or cardiovascular disease programmes alongside support for tobacco producers to be nonsensical . #% The Council intends to adopt this measure at the end of the month on the basis of a different text to that on which Parliament was consulted . #% I again thank the rapporteurs and finish by saying to the railway industry that this is a crucial time for all railways in Europe . #% Firstly , the completion of the reform of the institutions . #% Make some political statements , but let us not hold this up unnecessarily . #% As we have seen , Member States cooperating on a bilateral basis , without being hamstrung by needlessly heavy institutional constraints , have produced results . #% In practical terms that means that an organic readymeal could contain minor ingredients like herbs and spices which are not readily available in organic form . #% Dolores Shambley is a woman with very little money , who was given very little assistance . #% Has that resulted in an increase in the effective supply of labour or do we need to hang on to the increasing unsustainable view that structural unemployment represents the bulk of unemployment ? #% Every day millions of litres of fuel are wasted and unnecessary emissions are produced because of aviation delays and aircraft in transit across Europe 's skies . #% How does one define these classes ? #% The earlier cease-fire , which was aimed in part , from the EU 's point of view , at ensuring Indonesian support for the worldwide fight against terrorism , whilst protecting the human rights of the Acehnese , is clearly now defunct . #% The first thing I would say to the rapporteurs is that the Committee on the Environment 's attempt at a compromise was based on the need to strike a medium here between those legitimate concerns and the pressures of the single market . #% There should be no discrimination between any of the applicant countries as they endeavour to meet the Copenhagen criteria , tackle absorbing the acquis communautaire and prepare for the single market and the euro . #% That can and should be delivered . #% I believe he was one of the few working , because of the World Cup excitement . #% But there is another important matter , however , which has received very little publicity and to which this debate is designed to draw attention . #% Madam President , Commissioner de Silguy made a point of contradicting my statement that unemployment had not changed over the course of this Parliament by saying it had changed from 11 % to 10 % . #% This stand , like all the others , will be full to capacity on 17 June . #% Mr President , can I join in the very warm welcome to my colleague , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ' s approach , and commend her on the drive and persistence with which she has advocated this directive and the approach that we have taken . #% That really is a brave decision , because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table , which is something nobody likes . #% Madam President , I am more distressed to have to disagree with Mrs Roth-Behrendt than she is to have to disagree with Mr von Wogau . #% We also find that people want access to resources in order to be able to understand the information they are given . #% So what about this Stability and Growth Pact ? #% 
I mention that because , when it came to my turn to speak , it enabled me , as a British delegate from a third party , to speak in support , despite the fact that all three parties have many different policies on different issues . #% He has no respect for human rights , minority rights , international law or international opinion . #% I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether in his view the presidency compromise encompasses those points of principle contained in both the framework directive and the universal service directive . #% Those organisations include : the Confederation of British Industry , the National Farmers ' Union , the Road Haulage Association , the Quarrying Association , the Coal Industry and JCB , the heavy equipment manufacturer . #% In a few years time , following the enlargement of the European Union , they will have access to a potential 500m customers - as big as the American and Japanese markets put together . #% I do not have a clear answer to President Pastrana 's dilemma , as only 18 % of Colombians in a recent poll supported suspending peace talks , scrapping the demilitarised zone and resuming full-blown civil war . #% Mysteriously , the sessional services , not realising perhaps the sensitivity of this , decided of their own volition to put the word ` aspirations ' instead , without any consultation with the political groups . #% He was considerate , courteous and thorough . #% They do not want to see the addition of vegetable fats anywhere , in any Member State , in any form , for anything called chocolate . #% However , although at face value this report has noble intentions , it serves to threaten Britain 's heritage . #% Hence we urge the House to reject the report . #% Sadly , we all know that the Council did not have a very good weekend . #% The benefits are estimated to be EUR 8.6 million across the public sector : a genuine multiplier . #% I am very glad to see also that the new guidelines that will be introduced for Radio Television Hong Kong will be based on those applying to the BBC and other international broadcasters , thus helping guarantee its neutrality . #% Mr President , on behalf of myself and several other MEPs , while I fully respect the solemn nature of today ' s formal sitting , I wish to make a point of order under Rule 19 out of concern for human rights given that the Colombian President ' s visit today is restricted to his parliamentary address until a formal dinner with heads of political groups . #% The small dealer is being invoked as a victim here , but he has much to gain from a reform of franchising , as Mrs Villiers has said . #% The crisis in Latin America and in the world as a whole should alert us to the necessity of questioning the neo-liberal policies which became the conventional wisdom and seeking to construct a new model of development involving regulation at the global level , a new international financial agreement , reform of international financial institutions and a new deal to reverse the trend to ever greater income inequality and vast poverty . #% I hope that all the institutions will make efforts to obtain a discharge closer to the events to which it relates . #% This Parliament urges you to reform , and if you do not quickly reform the system , then please leave and let someone who will do the job do it properly . #% In addition , it is imperative that the public authorities monitor closely the change over to the euro . #% We could actually call it the UK rebate budget ; the UK gets its rebate of about ECU 2.8 billion , but this has been corrected downwards . #% I want particularly to support the amendments from my colleagues Mr Hendrick and Mme García Arias which talk about the possible abuses of dominant positions . #% The first relates to his views about the likely development of the eCall technology , which will give automatic location of a vehicle after an accident . #% There will be something to be cheerful about . #% The South African negotiators have brokered a very significant consensus in their own country in a very difficult situation . #% We , however , believe that it was necessary to state what the criteria should be and to insist upon that . #% Lastly , as a British Conservative , I welcome in particular Malta and Cyprus , two Commonwealth countries whose historically rich and entrepreneurial cultures will provide a new and valued contribution to the Union . #% We should reject the natural radiation aspects of this proposal out of hand . #% On the Dührkop report on the adjustment of the financial perspective , the trialogue which occurred earlier this week , as Commissioner Liikanen said , has been extremely fruitful , carried out in an atmosphere of cooperation where the three institutions want to get a settlement . #% Can we persuade Russia -- the crucial element in the equation -- to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol and bring it into force ? #% We must avoid the twin dangers of suburbanization and depopulation . #% We have got to ensure that our law enforcement procedures and systems are able to compete effectively with these international criminal structures that we have today . #% Over the past two weeks Conservative MEPs , as others , have cross-examined the nominated European Commissioners . #% The German market is almost as difficult to enter , despite so-called full competition . #% But is this enough ? #% Mr President , as previous speakers have said , precisely what to do to give regional and local authorities a higher profile and standing is proving to be controversial under the Convention . #% It is going to give legal certainty and positive status at European level to cooperatives , something for which we have argued for a long time . #% There is a growing and cross-border trade in human tissues and cells across Europe for research in laboratories and clinics and for the production of medical and pharmaceutical products . #% However , what we have from the Council is the result of some good work all round . #% Secondly , for some diseases there is no treatment -- or it is only patchily available -- and there is very limited research . #% And how can we talk about disasters without mentioning the CAP , which created wine lakes and butter mountains and is now giving Commissioner Mandelson as much of a headache as it is the farmers in the developing world ? #% He was arrested on charges of homosexual conduct , criminalised in that country under Article 120 of the criminal code , in contradiction with the provisions of the ICCPR ratified by Uzbekistan . #% Either we have a European Union based on law or we do not . #% Mr President , I supported the Members ' Statute because we need urgent reform of our travel expenses system in time for the new Parliament next July . #% Quietly spoken , he told of his aspirations for his country , a country of great potential but where , as we have heard , democracy and human rights are now denied and the rule of the law flouted . #% I prefer to retain a national foreign policy and work through NATO . #% Your reassurances that all is well do not work . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , as ECR signatory to the joint motion , I am very pleased we are now engaged in this debate . #% I love this House and I love this Chamber . #% But , on the other hand , there is a lack of realism : in an earlier reference in paragraph 5 ( ix ) we have the usual rehearsal of left-wing objections to the activities of speculators . #% Though we are talking about a PDB for the year 2001 , it is somewhat difficult not to link it to the revision of the Financial Perspective . #% Now we see a series of amendments , which typifies the approach of this Parliament : seeking to make slightly better something that is inherently flawed . #% Anyone would think that the common fisheries policy has been a great success , when in fact we see fish stocks in European waters as a whole declining more and more . #% Will you look at this again ? #% We therefore consider that those who are registered should be covered by provisions that , for instance , will enable a partner to participate in the European Union civil servant 's health insurance scheme and will enable an official to use special leave provisions when , for example , a partner is suffering from a serious illness . #% Member States need to strengthen their economies too , thereby creating opportunities . #% I would agree with much of what has already been said in this debate . #% Of course , I understand clearly the argument that telephone communication information can help us to track down people . #% We do not want to have any more tedious debates in this House about state intervention , about criticising managements . #% Secondly , the proposal that we are called to vote on is , in any case , unacceptable to the British Government itself because it does not allow for regionalisation , it restricts the Government 's freedom in deciding spending priorities and it maintains a franchise unsuitable to the UK 's farming structure . #% I am therefore delighted that the British Conservative Leader , David Cameron , is devoting particular attention to relations with India . #% I , of course , like all democrats , totally share the views expressed about the necessity of a free press in democratic societies . #% . Mr President , we all agree with the Commissioner that increasing the uptake of pensions is of paramount importance , especially in relation to voluntary pensions , whether by virtue of this directive or through any other means . #% As with so much in this field , these conclusions should be seen as just a start . #% I hope that it will not be a permanent difficulty , that one day it may be possible for all the Member States of the Union to be part of the free movement area . #% I agree with the Commission that the best way to protect investors is through a strong combination of competition , conduct of business rules , conflict of interest rules , best execution rules and transparency . #% 
We will use that power , Mr President - and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power - to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency ( and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group ) , but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council . #% The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I can not quite believe we had to fight for that , but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks . #% I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning . #% Pollution has further economic consequences , by reducing crop yields and damaging trees . #% Firstly , because although we are about to invoke the WTO dispute procedure , it is an unwieldy procedure and we may lose capacity in the interim . #% I very much welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy is here to address this issue and I am pleased that , under the leadership of Mrs McCarthy , we have taken an initiative that I hope will shed some light on this issue . #% We have the chance , as a House , to show that we all support that phrase and that it is not empty of meaning , but a phrase of substance . #% It is clearly a major problem for our country . #% They are very delicate , regarding finding a long-lasting peaceful solution to the Ngorno Karabakh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan . #% Coming to the substance of what the debate this morning is all about , this is actually the European Parliament 's opportunity to put forward its views to the European Council which meets in Florence at the end of this week . #% Green technologies are not reflected enough , though some are not fit for purpose . #% Moreover , Russia does not currently receive Community loans , and the lending mandate of the European Investment Bank for countries outside the European Union does not extend to Russia . #% Looking forward , and in the light of his determined commitment to the better regulation agenda , we need to keep a close eye on the implementation and effectiveness of this directive . #% We will need strong international cooperation , and the newly-fledged European Central Bank will need to quickly master its global , as well as its local , role . #% I am also very concerned to avoid food coming into the European Union that does not meet the high standards of our production . #% Irish universities face a 6 % cut , and Britain is not exempt from this because in England , the Higher Education Funding Council reckons there may be a cut of up to EUR 500 million from higher education . #% Nonetheless , I am a great believer in the power of culture to ensure mutual understanding and to spur innovation and economic growth . #% Together we can strengthen Europe . #% If you look at the fact that the legislation is adopted anyway , in the first place , under codecision by Parliament and the Council , it is up to Parliament and the Council to put in place any system , and any checks and balances that they want . #% Directives on a sectoral basis alone will only result in ` salami slicing ' of the overall public interest and carve out sectors for business benefit . #% It is clear that the sugar industry needs reforming : we have been dumping sugar on the world market and destroying it . #% But when you take over the presidency you are not assuming executive office , you are taking the chairmanship of one of the institutions with an inherited agenda for a very short period of time , and people expect too much of it . #% The Turkish authorities can then respond in a spirit of goodwill . #% Is it not better to incinerate animals over 30 months old rather than start putting too much of this old beef into intervention ? #% The rail sector is currently covered by the 1993 directive , but road is not covered by anything approaching a similar regime . #% We actually thought at the time of the modus vivendi that the situation had been put to one side and at the next revision of the Treaty the people who are to blame failed to come up with a proposal that put this matter to bed in spite of giving an assurance , at the time of the modus vivendi , that this was the only technical way of bridging the gap until the matter could be resolved . #% The Commission is at least accountable to this Parliament . #% As has already been said this afternoon , the list in this resolution is a sad one , but it is not exhaustive . #% Of course , we have a duty to other EU Member States and to people seeking a safer and a freer life , but the recent Court ruling points at larger problems , which are the relationship between the European courts , European legislators and the Member States and their control of their own borders . #% I want to look at the challenges that are inherent in the Lisbon process for Parliament , the Commission and , indeed , all three institutions . #% All of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are in line with the Commission 's intentions as regards the implementation of the scheme and introduce improvements and refinements to the proposal that we originally submitted . #% Does the Commission have a view on this approach or is it happy to leave it entirely at the disposal of domestic governments to decide how they will deal with the matter within the first two years ? #% And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision , so there is an essential role for the European Union there . #% This is not so much a question of institutional sensitivities : it is more that a unified and strengthened EU human rights report can provide a stronger voice for Europe and our commitment to human rights in the world . #% We should value this resource better and take greater care of the resource that not only sustains a whole host of plant and animal species but is slow growing and takes many years to reach maturity . #% It is an amalgam of assumptions and suspicions fudged together by the green movement as a universal panacea . #% That is what this motion sets out to achieve . #% I wish the European Union would interfere and legislate less , for if the European Union is the answer it must surely have been a very stupid question . #% Only if the Romanian Government and its administration are willing to forego corruption in all its insidious forms can poverty ever be conquered in Romania . #% This shows us the actual cost of implementing the proposed directive on national emission ceilings . #% The practical changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002 will clearly be a litmus test for the ECB and I very much hope that it will rise to the challenge . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office what the position is regarding what I was told by Mr Blair -- and indeed what I was told today by Mr Straw -- concerning how we go forward with this issue of openness and transparency in terms of the Council . #% The precautionary principle should rule . #% We face an enormous challenge , not least in jobs . #% You referred to the framework document produced , in February 2003 , by the Greek Government , because it was a Greek initiative . #% That seems to me to be a driving force for the whole of the European Union - the gradual integration of national systems . #% What we have to do is get the balance right and I believe he has moved in that direction . #% It was disappointing that the Union failed to take the opportunity to threaten further specific sanctions should violence , oppression and intimidation mar the elections in Zimbabwe . #% We also need to spend time looking at existing legislation and seeing whether it has achieved the effect that we asked for . #% Of course they have to act , but so does the European Parliament . #% Of course , to achieve the moderate savings pursued by the rapporteur and others within the Parliament , we need to ensure we also identify savings within the budget . #% That does not seem to me to represent a threat to the autonomy of the European Union . #% Democracy will , I hope , one day be the norm throughout the whole of Asia . #% How will this make the system better ? #% However , I read in -- presumably one of Mr Wynn 's favourite newspapers -- that the Japanese Government has pledged USD 5 billion over several years for Iraq 's reconstruction in contrast to our EUR 200 million . #% We met the President and the Prime Minister of Bulgaria and many ministers . #% When this question was raised some months ago , the body concerned foolishly wrote to Managua and said it is not intended to make a visit during this year . #% Without the restored confidence of the latter , there can not be a secure future for the former . #% Fontainebleau gives Britain back a rebate of two-thirds the difference between our annual contributions and annual receipts from the EU . #% I congratulate the army on its professionalism in protecting the Republic 's institutions . #% Mr President , I hope colleagues are aware of the importance and significance of this report . #% Mr President , I should first of all like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur and her report . #% Growers -- many of them in my region -- have been calling on the Commission to increase the threshold or scrap it altogether . #% I , of course , would have preferred a shorter time . #% Well , it is safe . #% We must insist that the Government respect the independence of the judiciary , the rule of law and the human rights of the Pakistani people as the country moves forward to democratic elections . #% 
You wrote : ` Since the first statement of assurance in respect to the financial year 1994 , the Court has repeated its reservations in respect to the reliability of the accounts . #% But the latest spate of restructuring in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union shows that we are far from achieving those things . #% This put the European Parliament into a quandary , not of its own making but one that was exacerbated by the weaknesses of its own rules and procedures . #% The SESAR joint undertaking must be established now in such a way that we avoid unnecessary problems and delays further down the line . #% These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion . #% I call on the Turkish authorities to drop these shameful prosecutions . #% The payoff for those favours , it seems , was a WTO ruling which effectively threatens the entire social fabric of a region . #% We have learned that recycling is not in itself a good thing but only good when it is positive and beneficial to the environment . #% I say that with a lot of sadness because the Council deserves to be criticised over SAB1 and SAB3 . #% Since the schools are preparing young people for an education in the single market of Europe , we must make sure that the schools across Europe are all doing their work to prepare people for the single market those young people are going to work in . #% I ask you , Mr President , to confer with your colleagues so that the whole range of EU-Russia relations can be investigated , debated and our influence brought to bear not least on the turbulent Mr Putin , who is putting us all in danger . #% On the question of return , are we forcing women to return to Afghanistan , to an environment described by Human Rights Watch as being just as oppressive as it was under the Taliban ? #% I wonder whether you could now give Sir James Goldsmith the floor so that he can reply in person to the attack I made on him . #% One of the things we were talking about in the Committee recently was the importation of chicken meat from Brazil because of the danger that this was impregnated with nitrofurans . #% I am grateful for his interest . #% That is nothing exceptional . #% This fund could do much to bolster these efforts and consolidate the work under way since the Lisbon dot.com Summit . #% Both regions are very different , although they share certain characteristics : both formed part of the former Soviet Union and inherited a dislocated command economy and a political system subject to Moscow . #% He was seen as not representing the views of the British Government sufficiently and as saying ' I am guilty ' by implication . #% Again my country has suffered , not least with the growing mountains of refrigerators awaiting disposal . #% In particular Russia needs to know that we will not tolerate the annexation and recognition of the sovereign Georgian territories seized in last summer 's war . #% This is not just about economic and social rights , but about people all over the world who have lost their lives or who have been subject to abuse simply because they are disabled . #% Mr President , I shall not respond immediately to Mr Tannock , but will begin by stating dispassionately that the notion of human rights , including the right to a fair trial , is the highest priority for all the parliamentary groups . #% I would suggest that we leave it on our agenda . #% However , I am now concerned that many amendments that were comprehensively defeated in the Industry Committee are being retabled . #% Personally I believe that we have to have it , certainly for children up to the age of six , although some will argue that that leads to another kind de facto ban . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission for giving us two speeches within the space of 24 hours . #% That is just a start . #% The old comfortable attitude to the regulation of agriculture has gone - gone for good and quite rightly . #% You lost the Constitution and you are now treating the voters of France and Holland with contempt . #% I welcome the bulk of this resolution , in particular the defence of the state 's duty to protect its citizens against terrorism and the need to continue dialogue on human rights with countries such as Iran , whose track record is appalling with the recent execution of a 16-year-old girl for sexual misdemeanours . #% We must see the evidence of change , particularly in the vital areas of justice and policing and the fight against organised crime and corruption . #% I am frankly surprised the Presidency has anything at all to report to us from the summit . #% This way we can see how far we are going without having to predict what our expenditure will be too far into the future . #% Those misgivings were borne out by the recent findings of the Commission 's Internal Audit Service which recommended first , the development of different working methods and audit practices , second , the introduction of more appropriate management tools , and third , the improvement of the standard of agreements and the structure of the expenditure financed . #% The WFP only expects to deliver food rations to 110 000 people , 10 % of the worst-affected area 's 1.2 million . #% I certainly believe that the report sadly does not give enough emphasis to what needs to be done to control the Internet . #% I am pleased to say that at the common position stage , we have a clear indication in a separate article about the importance of Member States providing for disabled users on a wide range of services , in particular ensuring that disabled users have the sort of choice and range of services that all other consumers expect . #% It is important overall to make the general point that in these proposals , as well as all others we deal with on industrial and financial services , we should make every effort to ensure that they are not overly bureaucratic and that the framework is as easy as possible for firms , both large and small , to operate in . #% This amendment should be supported so that these discussions can take place . #% Yet we keep trying again . #% Then we have the inaction by the British government , which chose not to impose any extra sanctions on stopping people from travelling , even though they knew they might cause trouble . #% There is a difference between the two . #% Yes , they did . #% Madam President , I wish to associate myself with the comments just made by Mr Vatanen . #% Those governments tend to take a minimalist position on the European role in public health and on the whole it has been far too negative and far too blinkered . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - Mr President , can I start off by first of all thanking the Committee on the Internal Market 's shadow rapporteurs from all the groups , their staff and advisers ? #% So , my question is : Will the Council please stick to its guns on this and encourage the British presidency to do the same ? #% The conference rooms - in particular the large ones - are under-utilised . #% When they were asked what they were desperate for , they did not say retroviral drugs , they said food , because they were too poor to be able to afford either . #% Most governments can hope to contribute to economic growth only by clearing the decks of obstacles and creating an enterprise-free environment . #% If , for example , we look at the history of western policy towards former Yugoslavia , we see the effectiveness of that ebbed and flowed with the ebb and flow of US domestic politics . #% Sadly , it seems not . #% We now have to push our national governments to raise their standards to those of the best , and not hide behind an international compromise . #% I sucked my pencil and thought , ` My goodness me , what have I done ? #% So I want to commend to the House the view of the sufferer as well as the view - if there is to be one - of the person who is concerned above all about preserving the embryo . #% I wonder whether you are concerned that they might be still playing games with the European Union and the international community and they will again say : `` look , this woman is impossible . '' #% In many ways the rules of the WTO are not neutral ones that can be used defensively to protect the interests of the weakest players . #% Surely we owe all of our citizens the right to ensure that things are made as easy as possible for those involved in car accidents abroad and for their families . #% I voted in favour of this Conciliation Delegation Report but with some misgivings . #% The old theories about free trade always being a win-win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches . #% That has to be our first goal , to have free circulation of such a binding certificate , in the same way as we have free circulation of ordinary judgments . #% A key objective for us must be for all 135 members of the WTO to have a part to play in that process of reform as well as what goes on afterwards . #% It is a fair rule , it is at the discretion of the President , and you are quite right to use it in that way . #% I make several recommendations in my report and I call upon the Commission to take action . #% In your own words , could you define that term for me ? #% 
I should also like to thank our former colleague , Mr Haarder , and his team because they are creating an historic Danish Presidency . #% Mr President , reading the newspapers one would think that the European Council in Barcelona is going to settle every detail of this legislation . #% Also , it is a big threat to research and development . #% Unlike my colleague , Mr Cushnahan , I am not yet convinced that an international military force is the solution needed to end the hostilities and kick-start the peace process , as I do not think that a totally neutral force could ever be assembled . #% It is important because as the United Nations has declared , it is to be one of the priorities for the UN for the next fifty years , as declared by Boutros-Boutros-Ghali , Secretary General . #% It would be helpful if the Commission could address this question , and I understand the Commission has already sent Italy a reasoned opinion in respect of the Eighth Company Law Directive relating to the professional qualifications of auditors . #% Clearly , if it held these views anywhere in an EU Member State , it would have been banned as a political party . #% We should bear in mind that in Kaliningrad in particular , we have a perfect example of how we need to proceed . #% I hope the Commissioner will respond directly to this point tonight . #% I would like to challenge you to make three key assurances about your presidency . #% If the reference to Michelin is there , that is the text we should vote on today . #% It is a chronic health issue and has considerable effects on the quality of life of those who acquire this disease . #% However , given the constantly changing situation surrounding the Hungarian media law and a lack of opportunity to meet the Commission following the new amendments to this law which were adopted this week , we feel that now is not the appropriate time to have another resolution on the issue . #% The press is muzzled , human rights organisations are barred and opposition is driven abroad . #% And secondly , as has been said particularly by Commissioner Kinnock , a peaceful transition of Hong Kong is in the interests of all concerned . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in this debate on a resolution that has jointly been tabled by five groups . #% Thirdly , as I am on my feet and I have your ear , can you do anything about the fact that the some of the huissiers at the entrance are smoking on duty . #% No wonder Richard Holbrooke recently boasted that Europe slept while President Clinton resolved a particular European crisis . #% It is unlikely that these countries will be able to transform themselves into the paragons of virtue they are supposed to be before they can join in one year 's time . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply to Mrs Hardstaff . #% I hope you will apply competition law and merger law toughly , but always ensure that you look at each merger on its own merits . #% I hope that you will take a stronger stance and come back with a stronger answer when you have considered the full implementation of your key negotiating standards . #% Are there some issues that certain Member States still have with it ? #% I hope that the Commission will continue to maintain this pace of improving safety at sea . #% We still have to sell enlargement to the people , both in the EU and in the candidate countries . #% However , especially since President Putin came to office , Russia has responded by seeking to partly distance itself from Belarus . #% The Commission has also recognised that this proposal to reduce VOC emissions is going to have an important effect on the environment . #% This report provides for a later review in three years ' time , which will look at the scope of the measure and the experience gained and see how best we can move forward in terms of other health monitoring . #% It is failing to delivery security from fear , even though we talk a lot about creating an area of freedom , security and justice . #% paragraph 31 - the United States has not declared that it would `` not engage in preventive military action against Iran '' , and it would be wrong to rule out any option at this stage . #% You deserve the praise of this Parliament for the work you have done in the budgetary areas and especially in some of the areas where you have tried to change things within the Commission . #% However , I should like to focus the Commission 's mind on another issue . #% The EU country with the most successful economy is Finland . #% Scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries . #% President Musharraf should recognise that we have not turned our back on Pakistan . #% I am glad that the study has at least started , despite the fact that we are having to wait until mid-2007 , when it was first requested in December 2005 . #% My last point is on the issue of Amendment No 6 and Carrageenan and Processed Eucheuma seaweed . #% The report recognizes the amount of money spent on research . #% It is the job of both our rapporteurs to assess those amendments . #% We are waiting for the US to decide against these Federal laws . #% Madam President , we need to establish the facts in this case . #% Indeed , I welcome his open and constructive approach in meetings and in the recent letter with regard to the issues of informing Parliament about the activities of the Energy Community and addressing some of the concerns of my committee over social and human rights issues . #% In countries such as Egypt , Tunisia and Libya , we should concentrate our efforts on consolidating nascent democratic awakenings into a lasting legacy of stable , secular and enlightened governance . #% We are governed by that 1986 resolution which is still pertinent and very much to be supported . #% They are not refugees : they have been driven from their homes . #% Multiparty elections which were promised for last December were cancelled and now parties themselves have been banned . #% Hizbollah has 12 MPs in the Lebanese Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers is therefore reluctant to ban it , claiming there is a difference between its civilian political activities and its military wing . #% There can be no economic progress or investment while lawlessness is rife . #% Above all , an immediate cease-fire is required , to concentrate on the terrible plight of those displaced and their return home . #% Consequently , amounts entered in reserve - and that whacking big sum of EUR 125 million is in reserve - for agreements which have not been concluded , are considered to be non-compulsory . #% Ironically , in her report Mrs Honeyball underlines the belief that the annual circulation tax paid by users of private cars should be the competence of national authorities with which I would wholeheartedly agree . #% The video evidence that we saw in Court showed that my constituent , Mark Forrester , was not involved in any way , shape or form with any violence . #% Allow me to tell a personal story . #% We must help them succeed and thrive and not hold them back . #% We now have an eradication plan on the table and the derivatives ban has been lifted , courtesy of the courage and persistence of Commissioner Fischler . #% Unfortunately , one of the problems of wide-ranging answers and short times is that you get breadth but you do not get depth , and I would like to ask for a bit more detail . #% Questioning the executive -- questioning the Commission , rather than giving our little speeches -- is one of the most fundamental things we do in this Parliament . #% There is a net flow of skills away from Africa , where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward . #% I was surprised to see this report and its contents on the agenda . #% Every effort should be made to integrate minorities into the mainstream of a nation 's life without denying them the right to express their own language or culture . #% This is a real danger and it must be acknowledged . #% It was the occasion when the Palestinians were expelled from Jordan by King Hussein and swept into the Lebanon , destroying what had been up till then a haven of relative peace and civilisation in the Middle East . #% I am just sorry the Commissioner is unable to listen to what we are saying and is too busy texting people . #% I thank the Commissioner for having given us an insight into what he is preparing for the next year . #% Most of the camp 's inhabitants received professional military training during the previous Saddam Hussein regime and they participated with his presidential guards and with other security forces in the violent crushing of the Iraqi people 's popular uprising after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991 . #% And he has largely done that , as many colleagues have said . #% 
We are where we are today because of that . #% Israel has a responsibility to bring Palestine to independent statehood . #% Does the Commissioner agree that as far as the European Parliament is concerned there are still some harmful prejudices about Turkey with Turkophobes willing to seize upon any pretext to block the accession process ? #% Perhaps again this is something that will be subject to conciliation but we will have to see if and when that is triggered following our vote tomorrow . #% The European Arrest Warrant swept away , at a stroke , the safeguards against arrest established in Britain over a thousand years . #% Madam President , I do not wish to delay proceedings , but just to follow up on the point , which has been made on a number of occasions , about parliamentary immunity . #% The principal argument for this great reform is clearly that it strengthens the European Union . #% Of course the media were there looking for the ` f ' word but fraud is scrupulously not mentioned in the report . #% At the human rights forum this morning I spoke to one of the President-in-Office ' s Finnish colleagues from the Finnish Foreign Ministry , about a particular case mentioned by the European Parliament recently , the case of Alexander Nikitin , a man who is on trial just a few miles away from Helsinki , for high treason . #% Of course , we also know that women are more likely to have career breaks , to work part-time , to work on short-term contracts and they are still less likely to hold elected office . #% The answer is because the regime of Eritrean President Afewerki is one of the most repressive on the planet . #% But General Pinochet 's own rights will be scrupulously respected , unlike those of thousands of his victims as he faces the judicial process here in Europe . #% Mr President , Mr Färm , the rapporteur , has said all that I was going to say . #% A huge reform was carried out after quite a struggle which I actively support ; and , in my opinion , the decision that was taken at that time will lead to an improvement in the situation . #% I can only offer a little 1940 's anglicised Latin in sympathy which I believe follows the Buddhist teachings , -- do n't let the bastards grind you down . #% Mr President , congratulations to the Commissioner for a very bold and courageous proposal . #% Today , Europe has an opportunity to respond to extremist forces within our borders in an intelligent , strong , liberal manner , considering our citizens as equal , unless and until any one of them actually takes actions which threaten the security of our society . #% I can not accept that we should go further from the area which was laid down in the very extended debates in committee . #% We can also be sure that we can create more biomass . #% It is not a question of parallelism , it is a question of substance . #% The 2005 talks were still structured so that discussions took place in different sites at the same time . #% In this context I was pleased to be invited along with others to speak last autumn to a group of officials from the Polish parliament who were visiting London under the auspices of one of the London universities . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , can you explain why a vote on the Brok amendment was permitted in committee and carried , and yet ruled out of order in plenary ? #% They can offer consumers alternative jurisdiction but only under very specific conditions . #% Even though we can not apply that system , we have never wished to stop others doing so where it is appropriate . #% That does not mean , however , that all of us on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection follow her entirely down that road . #% I do not need to remind Members that this is the last budget of this Parliament . #% Although some progress has been made in combating salmonella in the UK , there is still much work to be done . #% But Mr Lannoye did not accurately represent some of the amendments , including Amendment No 13 in my name and others which sought to set proper labelling in a position where the consumer can see it and can get all the information necessary in order to make a judgment about whether you use cocoa butter or not . #% Now we see a stable democracy , a buoyant economy , 5 % growth , record foreign direct investment , a factor of regional stability and a contributor to NATO . #% Any person or organisation perpetrating or inciting such discrimination should be subject to the full force of the law . #% We have engaged in correspondence on this and to that end , because of a lack of satisfactory conclusion , we have put down an amendment on behalf of both the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People 's Party to resolve this problem this year . #% The fundamental problem is poverty , with hundreds of millions of people around the world , particularly in Asia , living on less than one euro a day . #% I should like to hope that , increasingly , colleagues could recognise that money is not just a reflection of importance , and that it is possible to vote strongly for a report without increasing the money . #% We strongly support the aims of the directive and the regulation . #% But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur ' s work on this programme and , indeed , that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth , to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense . #% But today we seek justice for those people and renovation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of its people . #% The amendments we have put forward to the Lalumière resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority , to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged , to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations . #% The area of justice and human rights in the EU is not working effectively . #% In fact , Commissioner Rehn here said they had to agree their budget first before they would be allowed to have a general election . #% However , I do not believe in pan-European actions on these matters , particularly in relation to setting obligatory targets . #% Mr Belder 's report rightly calls for political pluralism , an independent judiciary and for the EU not to lift its arms embargo until China properly addresses the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms . #% Parliament 's rapporteur is to be congratulated for securing those . #% We can not , therefore , accept that amendment either , and I hope that , on reflection , the honourable Member , Mr Ferber , whom I know very well and have every reason to respect , will understand and accept the Commission 's view . #% It is a marvellous example to our own citizens and to the rest of the world . #% Finally , on the question of developing countries , I would like to pay tribute , in particular , to ACP countries , in which we have a particular interest and partnership in the European Union . #% Afghanistan 's neighbours have been enormously affected by the refugee problem , but equally countries such as the United Kingdom have felt the impact . #% Instead , the Oostlander report , even improved as it has been by amendment , is unsympathetic . #% My group welcomes this report . #% Non-compliance with internal market directives threatens the economic success of the European Union and I very much support Mr Bolkenstein 's action and hope that this leads swiftly to German compliance . #% Jacques Delors has recently reminded us that full implementation of all policies available in the Treaty would have created a people 's Europe . #% We must treat Kosovo as the future EU member that it is . #% Let me start with the final point in our report . #% Madam President , I should like to sympathise with the Commission . #% Does the Council intend to take action to make certain that Cuba has access to these agencies so that it can build up its own economy to the advantage of its own people ? #% The United Nations is a very important global organization . #% Introduced to the UK , # 20 , 000 million would be made available to SMEs to invest and grow businesses and jobs - jobs for the boys and girls , who are perennially ignored by Britain 's bankrupt government . #% The failure of the euro is nothing to do with speculation . #% With resources painfully limited , the decisions on how these resources should be employed should be local decisions , based on an assessment of the needs of the local communities and their different patterns . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect a final decision on the early retirement scheme . #% One of the reasons for welcoming this report is that farmers have to contend with so many uncertainties in their job . #% That precedent was then enshrined by agreements within the Treaty of Amsterdam , the draft Treaty of European Union . #% The thrust of the report you can find in paragraph 8 , and I think we can give our full support to what it says there . #% Given that these points were not sufficiently clarified in the vote , whilst welcoming those provisions seeking to combat any future outbreak of FMD , I decided to vote against the final vote on the report . #% Can the Council use its good offices to ensure that civilians do not suffer from lack of medical assistance ? #% You will find in our resolution something to the effect that our President should take this resolution to Florence . #% 
Probably like many Members in the UK , Mr President , you were shocked to find that the EU 's commitments made at the Rio Earth Summit to stabilize CO2 emissions at the 1990 levels by the year 2000 not only are not being fulfilled but are well on course to exceed those particular commitments by a substantial margin . #% Instead , I suspect the European Parliament is once again using a sledgehammer to miss the nut . #% What I would like to do in developing on Mr Pomés Ruiz ' question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed . #% Regular reports on the implementation of the regulation are to be compiled by the Commission . #% We have to have dialogue in countries like Cuba . #% Having said that , I wish to join my colleagues in calling for enhanced efforts from the Community and from the candidates to make sure that they acquire the full audiovisual acquis . #% Liberals everywhere support ministers that will subscribe to the development of European parliamentary democracy . #% Mr Farage is nodding . #% I trust that Council will now follow Parliament 's lead . #% His particular interest , knowledge and expertise in relation to health issues have been of great importance to our work in that Assembly . #% I hope that we will have the procedures in place so that bodies like the European Youth Orchestra and the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation know that their future is assured . #% I do not believe that the conversion costs , certainly as far as banks are concerned , should be passed on to the consumer directly because from 1 January 1999 the euro will only actually exist in electronic form . #% Air sampling must be organised to give an accurate assessment of annual personal exposure levels , and I am concerned that some amendments that call for roadside inlets would give a distorted picture of the problem . #% I have only touched on a couple of issues of concern to me because of time constraints ; Mrs Jöns ' report has gone into many other areas . #% How much are they investing in the issue of corporate social responsibility themselves ? #% We need the donor community to make available food aid that can be distributed through non-governmental channels ; and we want the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to galvanise the international community into taking coordinated and effective action against this intolerable regime . #% Thirdly , we want Member States to develop the infrastructures which will allow them , all of them , to carry out the monitoring work that must accompany the proper implementation of many of the EU directives we adopt here . #% There they do not actually recognize the existence of Aids and any prostitute found to have a condom about her person is imprisoned and has a statutory jail sentence of one year as a result of that . #% Firstly , the selection of the three strategic priorities -- namely enlargement , stability and growth -- is fine . #% At that point , a relatively minor accident could become very serious : you could be in shock , you could develop hypothermia , you could have bleeding which if not stemmed could be fatal . #% By contrast , we in the UK put up with , and indeed our economy suffers from , all the EU regulations being applied and , moreover , being applied to us in a way which is both unintelligent and universal . #% We need to stop arms sales to Indonesia and I welcome the four-month ban . #% Thirdly , we want to endorse the view of the rapporteur that a new vehicle design directive must be published to make sure vehicles are as friendly to pedestrians and cyclists as is humanly possible . #% That is why I will recommend to the Socialist Group that we support the amendment by Baroness Ludford which reintroduces the notion that this refers specifically to cross-border disputes . #% We believe that Member States should help their own redundant workers . #% There are many proposals in the White Paper that cause nobody any problems , but issues like co-regulation and the delivery of public policy by external agencies do cause problems . #% The ending of the 5.8 % so-called temporary levy , in place under various names since the 1970s , will provide a substantial part of the resources for meeting obligations . #% We also have as a central clause freedom to provide services , proposed by this side of the House . #% So while I would pay tribute to the efforts that have been made so far by the Council and the Commission , we have to say that more definitely needs to be done . #% We are not convinced that this important matter has been given the due consideration it deserves . #% I want them to release the Catholics and Christians in prison . #% It is an ongoing war that has been almost unnoticed . #% We accept that 20 % of the world is in recession ; we accept that 10 % is close to recession . #% This is an area where there is a clear need for European rules as well as national rules . #% In particular , it addressed the question of long vesting periods , difficulties with transferability of vested pension rights and tax difficulties linked to acquiring pension rights in more than one Member State . #% Since the vote in the Legal Affairs Committee , a number of further concerns have come to my attention . #% I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on . #% They should not apply to private companies , individuals or organisations , nor should they cover matters of social affairs , employment or cultural policy . #% I want to pay personal tribute to Mrs Paulsen , who has brought through a number of complex , difficult measures of this kind . #% The European Union is putting its political pretensions before the real security interests of the citizens of its Member States . #% She also underlines the problems of enforcement of its regulations in these very remote waters , with few resources for monitoring or policing . #% But we must remain vigilant . #% Nothing will be banned , but what you will not be able to do is to make a claim for a food substance if it is clearly not a healthy option for people . #% We now have to make the best of a bad job . #% That is exactly what we are trying to do in our amendments , by seeking to highlight the provision of information to workers . #% That is not going to be easy and it is going require far more effort than we have been prepared to put into it up to now . #% Finally , I just want to say that I regret that two of the amendments submitted today link textiles and REACH . #% As far as the ski instructors are concerned , their row with the French is only part of the argument . #% This Parliament has been consistent , through many resolutions , in its call for robust action against Mugabe and those who keep him in power . #% We in this Parliament will not accept Boeing 's prediction of one major accident per week . #% Third , the disappearance of the Equal programme may lead to a loss of impetus and we wish accordingly to see a requirement for gender mainstreaming at all programming stages . #% Four countries -- the Netherlands , France , Italy and Finland -- have Court judgments against them for inadequate designation of special protection areas for birds . #% Time and time again we have won the argument for a review of the internal rules of the institutions so that the Council in particular , when meeting in its legislative capacity , should meet in public and vote in public . #% But there are still many people walking the planet who are walking with impunity , and I believe that we are not doing enough in Europe to bring them to justice . #% The total employment costs of the administration of the European institutions is , as a proportion of the budget , 1.9 % of that budget . #% At present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging . #% If Parliament were to reject those two amendments it would make life a lot easier . #% I also congratulate Mr Barroso on the action he took yesterday to clamp down on energy giants in Europe , which are using their industrial muscle to hinder competition and distort the market . #% Despite efforts to reduce the number of children in institutions , Save the Children Romania says that no attention is paid to combating trafficking for sexual exploitation . #% But regrettably , unless the issues to which I have referred are fully addressed , in particular the reference to the use of satellite systems , I will be unable to support the rapporteur in her overall proposal . #% He is willing them to win and it is absolutely clear that they are going to do so . #% Terrorists should be given no hope of achieving their objectives by force , no comfort that they will avoid punishment for their awful crimes and no hiding-place . #% This legislation is a piece of civil , not criminal , law . #% More and more European money is being given to combat child sex tourism and to increase public awareness about child protection , with a EUR 1 million separate budget line , and the STOP and DAPHNE programmes . #% The last thing that these countries need is to follow the example of the failing economic model and increasingly centralised European Union , with its increasingly undemocratic and unaccountable political institutions . #% Nevertheless , the tick box on the EAW marked rape contains no definition or explanation of what constitutes the crime . #% 
Very briefly I would like to come back to you on three things : firstly is the Commission itself happy and confident that its own systems will survive through from 31 December 1999 to 1 January 2000 ? #% The Commission has been far too tentative in enforcement . #% At the moment , the only medium-term policy agenda is that set down by the European Council in December : the consolidation of public finances . #% So would she accept that it would be very helpful at the Council of Ministers , at the preparatory phase of the Northern Dimension discussions and negotiations , first to have an internal EU discussion involving the eight EU Baltic States ? #% We know that there are links between poor nutrition , poor housing , a poor environment -- the poor often live in the worst environments -- and poor educational prospects , which then follow through people 's lives and indeed those of their children . #% The simple certainties of the 20th century are less clear in the complexities of the 21st century . #% Both of those electorates clearly are somewhat concerned at the budgetary measures and steps being taken by their respective governments in trying to meet the Maastricht criteria required for European monetary union . #% Mr President , I know you are respecting Parliament 's wishes concerning the number of part-sessions and our votes at previous plenary sessions on where they should be held , but could you confirm where we are going to have the meeting on 1 May 2004 ? #% They are also stirring up scare stories about the Constitution . #% Speaking as an Englishman , I find it sad that the Cornish language died out in the 18th century . #% As it is , if we go on with the expectations that we are arousing but can not fulfil , we will not do Europe or Europe 's consumers any good . #% If in three years it has not resulted in a narrowing of the pay differentials between men and women , consideration must be given to making the code legally binding . #% Can we give that partnership the new dynamism that the Committee on Foreign Affairs believes it demands and deserves , and can we be a full partner of the USA , or must we always feel that we are falling behind ? #% I will be abstaining on this report . #% Nevertheless , I think we must act to clear the way for the new technology , for its exploitation and utilisation of spectrum , and I hope that this proposal and this report will do just that . #% Only with clear principles and a specific mission will the EFSA win the confidence of EU consumers and the entire EU food industry . #% Mr President , I am the Committee on Fisheries ' rapporteur on third country agreements so I am very interested in this particular resolution and I endorse all that has been said by those Members speaking for the resolution by the PSE , ELDR , GUE/NGL , Green and ARE Groups . #% At this time of financial struggle across Europe , we question , however , the need for the establishment of a permanent EU operational headquarters and what added value it would bring to the positive work already being done . #% One organization - the Football League - is being punished for the actions of another organization - the Premier League - over which it has no control . #% In the UK we have too many organisations trying to improve matters . #% Of course cohabitation is not entirely unknown here in the European Parliament . #% The agency will not be empowered to determine policy guidelines or to approve the reconstruction programmes . #% Once again Heads of Government could only agree to set theoretical deadlines for ministers to liberalise markets in the future , rather than actually set the seal on agreements that should already have been made or reach those agreements themselves . #% We believe that any such moves need to comply in the first instance with the common approach to impact assessment , recently agreed between the Commission , Council and Parliament . #% I would also bring to his attention some more recent events . #% I think that this Brok report has been a practical preparatory stage of the process of setting up the External Action Service but I also believe that we should pause now before we go further and settle important questions before the High Representative Vice-President is in place . #% Laskar Jihad is a threat to the first three of these . #% I should like to assure you that never happened , although I did give evidence in a case which involved a Member for whom a similar request was made . #% Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget . #% We want the presence of observers to deter violence and electoral fraud so that the Zimbabwean people can make a genuinely free choice . #% The previous youth programmes , Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service , will be grouped together in a general medium-term programme which will run from 2000 until 2006 , as the European Parliament has demanded . #% I am afraid that I must also urge colleagues to reject the amendments . #% Nevertheless , we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand . #% I suggest that the message here is clear , and you may be surprised at the strength of feeling in support of what you aim to do , surprised at the awareness that this directive could be good for consumers , good for taxpayers , good for growth and above all good for jobs . #% That was a weakness in the proposal . #% Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions . #% The starting point for this report has been a disastrous personal event for thousands of EU citizens : the loss of their pension investments . #% Since 1994 there has been repeated documentary evidence about all this and it is high time that something was done . #% This report has not come too soon - rumours of it being on the agenda of the December part-session are unfounded ! #% Why did the Council delete that from the broad economic guidelines ? #% It is about the future of the European economy and about the ability of any manufacturer who has intellectual property rights , whether protected by patent , copyright or registered design , or indeed by any other form of ownership , over a creative work or design that they have genuinely originated , to be able to protect and sell their products in a legitimate way , reap the profits and create jobs within the European Union . #% The cost of this programme year on year is probably considerably less than is lost to the Community by fraud and incompetence . #% It remains to be seen if the one-size-fits-all model of interest rates will work in all the countries of the Union , in particular countries like Ireland . #% We certainly need to do more work on IT , but that is being addressed in other reports . #% The Pakistan Government has put the financial cost of the earthquake at USD 5 billion . #% It is entirely appropriate that , coming from one of the new Member States most active in the field of the internal market , she has not only blazed a trail for Members from Slovakia , but also has the moral authority to carry this forward . #% This is a constraint on legislators , but it seems to me a proper constraint . #% It is important also to recall that from the very start the UK government has given full information to the other Member States and has followed the advice of the Standing Veterinary Committee . #% Amendment No 31 deals with products using traditional methods or sited in remote locations . #% They tried as hard as they could but the fact is that there was no agreed recognition by the national authorities , by local authorities or by consumers that would prove that their meat was alright , that it was good to eat - a good quality product . #% Trade between the United States and Canada on one hand and Mexico on the other has been given a very considerable boost by its inclusion in NAFTA , following the Mexican economic crisis . #% There are still issues that remain unaddressed - issues that are quite clear and evident to us because of events that have taken place in the recent past . #% I can understand and appreciate the fear that might be felt among certain people that this card would develop into an ID card , via the back door . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to welcome Greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of Greek membership . #% Mr President , I can only presume that in Mr Cassidy 's hurry to join the Socialists he forget to tell us . #% Concerning the Member States where it has been contested , you are quite right , because there are differences in testing procedures . #% We are told it is going to be dropped in by helicopters from 1,500 metres . #% On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would welcome the results of the conciliation . #% Does not the Commissioner see this programme as being yet another opportunity for us to have a dispute with the United States of America ? #% We have to remember , Mr Prodi , that when this Parliament has looked at this problem of a food agency in the past , we have not been absolutely sure about whether this is the right way forward . #% I also reject the notion , implicit within this that agents booking any travel arrangements should bear the contractual responsibilities and liabilities of either party #% These are minimum conditions which we must insist on . #% I think it is very important insofar as the integration of Europe is concerned for the social dimension to be understood . #% There is a particular situation in the United Kingdom regarding the payment of donors . #% The report argues that this administrative model needs to be supplemented now by a more flexible approach which would include more unlicensed use of spectrum and the tool of spectrum trading . #% Was the relationship with Mr Latsis really purely personal ? #% 
A study will now be produced , and I hope that when it is finished the Budgets Committee , which spends millions of pounds on very dubious projects ... #% The failure to do so will be a clear signal that repeated international calls for judicial independence and respect for democratic norms in Peru have once again been ignored . #% European citizens should not be subject to media censorship and selective news coverage . #% in writing . - I am pleased that Mr Belder was able to bring this report to the House and successfully push through elements concerning human rights in Iran , in particular , the strong condemnation of the detention of Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi , together with their wives . #% In addition , I call upon the Commission and the Council to assess why the action so far has been ineffective and make recommendations to remedy the situation . #% And if , as I believe , it is the case that the erosion of the country of origin principle threatens fundamentally the single market in electronic services in Europe - and this , in turn , has a significant read-across to the operation of electronic commerce around the globe - that would be very sad and damaging for Europe ' s citizens . #% It also pointed to a number of IT problems . #% It is abundantly clear that if you wish to see your country retain its independence , you have to vote ` no ' . #% Therefore , we look to the Commission to step up its responsibilities for health , health promotion , public health , health emergencies , mental health , disability , patient mobility and information for patients . #% We want to return this jointly to the Council and we want the Council to accept our opinion . #% It has . #% Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school . #% It is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society . #% I am very proud that this nascent EU right offers more : a real opportunity for our citizens to participate in and to move Europe . #% That makes me wonder just how many of these warm words will be turned into reality . #% It is only because of the collective action of the European Union and its institutions that we have stimulated in the last two years unparalleled levels of activity in the field of maritime safety . #% On other occasions , perhaps we could let matters simmer down before we resume voting . #% This says to me that the image of third-country nationals in the minds of some in this House represents only a very narrow part of the reality - in terms of a specific geography perhaps , a social class or political views . #% I wish we could find a new word for it . #% Changing tastes and a collapse in stock have transformed what was a local , cheap seasonal delicacy into a luxury product , almost exclusively for export to the Far East . #% The language barrier makes the isolation worse . #% We need to be preparing smart sanctions now . #% I am sure that the Members of the Fisheries Committee and General Morillon , in particular , would be most grateful to you . #% Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally . #% What is the attitude of the Finnish presidency towards law-making in secret , because at the moment the Council of Ministers is only matched by Beijing and North Korea in passing laws over citizens in secret ? #% However , there is no common platform . #% If you think this is a purely British complaint , think again . #% Another is that by changing the status of sectors , do we not distort the existing market ? #% I hope when we are talking about the European civil service as we proceed into the detail of the budget , we will perhaps extend some of the thoughts set out there and talk about both appointment and promotion being exclusively actions which should take place on merit . #% I thank the President-in-Office , the Minister and , in particular , Prime Minister Guterres for all the personal effort he put into this process . #% Those negotiations will last for many years . #% As has been said , this is voluntary . #% At last week 's constitutive session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly , representatives from Belarus were rightly missing . #% What we are facing here is not just a one-off issue limited to one sector , but a systemic issue , a challenge of much greater scope than I believe the Commission recognises . #% Here we are talking about abortion , which is accepted throughout most Member States of the European Union and has been accepted by this House . #% In principle , we are all for having a directive in this area so that there is clarity . #% It is interesting how , in this House we move seamlessly from global economic policy and world summits to the technical regulations of exhaust and sound level emissions from recreational craft in Europe : such is the broad sweep of politics dealt with in this place . #% We would like to see a clear timetable emerging in June , and not postponement to some vague point in the future . #% On question 2 , the Commission continually monitors the implementation of projects and programmes to ensure fulfilment of the said objectives . #% Tourism is classically an industry of the single market . #% Even then the Council would have been determined to block such a move from the Commission . #% There are problems with corruption and the rule of law . #% However , I wish to emphasise that I feel those aspects are more within the purview of our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs . #% I also view as a welcome addition to this report , and one that well accompanies the reduction in these thresholds , the simplified definitions . #% The Commission seems to prefer maintaining free access for the LDCs into a market with a price that is too low for them to compete , over that of negotiating with the LDCs an orderly market that achieves a price that allows them to compete and create development ' . #% It would be hypocritical of us to deny them the right to move around the European Union . #% Madam President , while there has been some progress along the road to democracy in Russia , much remains to be done . #% Could Commissioner van den Broek confirm that in effect what he is saying is that we are still in a position whereby within Bosnia there is actually no real freedom of movement , i.e. , we have still got de facto ethnic cleansing ? #% I would like to concentrate attention on paragraphs 10 and 11 of Mr Garosci 's report . #% I notice there are many members of the public here and I should also like to congratulate the public . #% The call for a directive concerning frontier effect reports is to be welcomed . #% Indeed , privileged partnership is such an excellent deal that I wish it were available to my country , the United Kingdom . #% In this reform process , Europe should play the leading role . #% That means that the money will not get through to NGOs until August . #% In other words , the market-based element of spectrum management would be service - and technology-neutral . #% The people of our world have never felt closer . #% We have recently received a letter from somebody who had tried to get a piece of legislation enforced and is now so disgusted with the whole European set-up , having been pro-European , that they now support an anti-European party . #% We can not pretend , now that two out of three ministerials have collapsed , that we are dealing with business as usual . #% In the West we did not seek a UN resolution to bomb the former Yugoslavia over Kosovo which still remains part of Yugoslavia , and yet we have felt willing , for whatever reason , to avoid any military intervention on behalf of the Timorese in the past . #% I say that because perhaps he ought to look a bit more in his own back yard . #% I would ask you , Mr President , also to check the procedure under which this question has been brought because I really wonder if it is acceptable procedure within our rules . #% This will become essential . #% They are matters that go to the very heart of the nation state and its responsibilities to its citizens in each case . #% I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their solidarity which includes their presence here tonight , my own assistant Laura Sullivan , the consumer NGOs and the Council Presidency , all of whom have brought us to a position where we can tonight demonstrate that the total support in Council is overwhelmingly replicated in Parliament . #% This is a compromise to which the banks , the lawyers , the accountants , the notaries and the ordinary citizen can look with confidence . #% I see that the PSE Group and the rapporteur have tabled some amendments to protect the reputation of the United Kingdom Government . #% 
The Stockholm water authority found that with phosphate substitutes there were on average ten times more suspended solids in their effluent , leading to a substantial increase in sludge ; whereas phosphate products were found to be less damaging in terms of eco-toxicity towards micro-organisms . #% You are hemmed in by ridiculous policies -- we are still subsidising coal production -- and economic priorities come to the fore , as they must , but sometimes to the detriment of the attempts we are all making to try and deal with these problems . #% In the light of the question from our Polish colleague , I would like to ask Commissioner McCreevy whether he would agree with me that this is exactly the sort of problem that will be fully addressed by the proposal for a directive on the internal market for services . #% It is for the electorate and not the courts to make political decisions , and actions such as this can only increase political extremism and perhaps the use of violence . #% Mr President , why is it that we insist that the specific legitimacy of the European Parliament is recognised in the preparation of the IGC ? #% I welcome the renewed commitment to reaching the UN target for development assistance and hope that , at last , this will be achieved as there is a desperate need for this . #% We all know that those students who participate in the Socrates Programme benefit tremendously from it ; sadly , not enough students do . #% In retabling our amendments at second reading , we therefore call on the Council radically to review its position . #% This is really a textbook case of where the single market legislation has not actually delivered . #% But at this stage it is most unhelpful to talk of delay and prematurely to raise the spectre of safeguard clauses . #% Labour MEPs will continue to support disarmament amongst possessor states , to prevent proliferation to new states , and ultimately to achieve a world that is free from nuclear weapons . #% I hope that the Council is very shocked by its own reply . #% The decision to move in this direction should be taken by ministers at Laeken this weekend . #% Looking at it from Britain 's point of view , it did not make good reading , so I put the following question to the Committee on Regional Development . #% This would allow expansion , should market conditions encourage growth , and allow new growers to enter the market . #% Of the three nations allowed a vote on the Maastricht Treaty seven years ago only Ireland , with a population of 3.6 million , showed any enthusiasm . #% A large slice of the money it encompasses will be used to brainwash the public into thinking that the European Union is wonderful and that ` integration ' really is a nice word . #% I still believe it goes too far in reference to sanctions in reducing thresholds in terms of sizes of companies and - frankly - in pushing the trade union agenda as an end in itself rather than in promoting the interests of employees . #% What a sad , inward-looking , almost ostrich-like speech that was from Commissioner Wallström . #% Seventy-five people died in 2000 , 139 in 2001 and so far this year 250 . #% I welcome this report and hope that it is used to move forward . #% Mr President , on the directive on mobile air-conditioning , I think we have a sensible compromise in Parliament . #% You were asked what you were going to do about labelling . #% However , when it comes to Brussels proving that it wants to treat people like an interfering nanny , this directive really does take the biscuit . #% I call on the Greek authorities to clarify the charges , release the defendants on bail and hold a trial in open court by Friday of this week . #% That said , we have more work to do to win hearts and minds in projecting a vision of Europe and the United States as beacons of human rights , non-discrimination , respect for difference and understanding of criticism . #% What about the single market and the free movement of goods between France and the United Kingdom ? #% We need an urgent statement and debate . #% After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland , it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message - ` Come in number 3 , your time is up ' . #% Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement . #% If we can qualify and classify these with the cross-border bodies , we shall have done a very good job . #% Let me say two things . #% We are entitled to more than an attempt at a three-card trick . #% It is the report that is important , but I would welcome your confirmation on that point . #% Mr President , I will start by bringing the House 's attention to the Delors White Paper which was charged with the task of providing a blueprint to get 15 million of Europe 's citizens back to work by the year 2000 , an ambitious task but one which I believe we should still pursue . #% There are enough records of these hotter events , such as certain crops growing where never before , but there are no records of islands disappearing beneath the waves . #% However , we have voted against paragraph 15 of the Nobilia report , as the idea of setting up a European framework of incomes policy and social security cuts directly into Member States ' competences . #% However , the signatories to the Conventions are the Member States , not the European Union ! #% This is because what we want to do is to have a trialogue and a conciliation meeting with the Council in July to formalise this , not just for the 2004 budget , but also for the other two budgets . #% I hope that the new Commissioners will be more positive in their attitude towards Ukraine 's aspirations . #% It is absolutely disgraceful that you are doing this , but I have hope and faith that in Westminster , the Mother of Parliaments for once will do her job and the British people will get a referendum . #% But the whole Parliament - not just the Committee on Development and Cooperation - has been clear that development is a political priority overall in this year 's EU budget , with support for the global fund against AIDS , TB and malaria . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in giving a warm welcome to Professor MacCormick ' s very realistic report . #% Secondly , I wonder whether I might ask the Commissioner to be very bold , because this really does come down to the question of Mrs Wallström 's debates with the Council of Ministers . #% Britain can not afford to rely solely on its own efforts , however . #% Instead of helping artists , this will hinder them , and there will be fewer small firms left in business . #% Many Member States have decentralised and localised administration and services for application . #% I have long argued for the need to send a strong , positive signal to Turkey that will sustain the commitment to modernisation and westernisation that has been a feature of that country for 80 years or more . #% I have some reservations about Amendment No 22 and the implications for oil companies of pollution caused by chemicals or noxious substances . #% The EU 's foreign policy ambitions and pretensions now reach into every area , from defence to immigration to energy supply , and we see few positive results from this . #% Conclusion four reads : ` to date , the consideration of the known circumstances of the Fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the UK ' . #% What we have seen of such committees in the past , we have not liked ; they have been secretive , bureaucratic , Kafkaesque . #% I hope it is ; otherwise , good intentions will founder here for sure and the old saying that the best can be the enemy of the good will be vindicated . #% The UN Convention of October 1980 banned the use of certain indiscriminate weapons ; the 1996 resolution of the Sub-Commission on Human Rights also explicitly condemned depleted uranium weapons because of their non-discriminatory character . #% Secondly , it is a characteristic of current developments in international relations that the traditional demarcation between domestic and foreign policy is breaking down . #% This exhibition set out to glamorise convicted felons who have committed heinous crimes . #% Therefore , as a friend of the OECD guidelines - in my view now the foremost international CSR standard , and also one signed up to by governments - I strongly support paragraph 25 , that future EU trade agreements should specifically cite the guidelines . #% The feed that is given to livestock also plays its part in ensuring that the food that ends up in our supermarkets and on our tables merits our confidence . #% It is not just a question of ` we want our money back ' -- we want our country back ! #% At the same time , you could walk along a country road and the sheep and lambs would stick their heads out through the fences . #% Is it worth us losing habeas corpus , our basic protection against the police state ? #% What we have seen and achieved and what we hope to improve is a sound system , one that is necessary and one that will enhance the quality of democratic debate at European level . #% However , change must come not just for the three Amsterdam leftovers ; extension of qualified majority voting , the size of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council . #% Human health must not be put at risk by what we are doing . #% Of course , the European Parliament , which approved the constitutional treaty by a large majority , wants to salvage as many as possible of the reforms contained in the constitutional treaty . #% It is an own-initiative report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% 
I also have even more components firms . #% We , however , need to measure our response to this unprecedented terrorism with the needs of the citizens ' own defences for the sake of civil liberties . #% Give this House the time and mechanisms which will allow us to respond in a way that meets not only the expectations of Europe ' s citizens but also of those in the global marketplace who are waiting for us to take a lead . #% Where is the incentive for Member States to use their own resources to police the use of the funds ? #% Having said that , I am pleased that the situation in Kashmir has been included . #% I would like to pick up three of the issues addressed which are vitally important . #% She has not had any Foreign Office experience ; she has not been a foreign secretary and I do not think she even had a part-time job in a travel agents ' . #% The speed of this tool has been invaluable , given the freedom to cross borders and increases in cross-border crime . #% It is predicated on the bizarre idea that if we set up separate EU decision-making structures , distract NATO 's Deputy Commander by giving him two sets of political masters to serve , and stick different flashes on the arms of the same troops in the Balkans , NATO 's capabilities are somehow reinforced . #% When one thinks about how terrible it is for any individual to have to deal with bereavement and then adds to that the difficulties of dealing with some sort of transnational legal situation , it is clearly an area that we have to try to tackle in order to make life easier for our citizens , having encouraged them to be mobile in the way that we have . #% It is important , therefore , to take the longer view . #% There are two areas that I also want to bring into the debate at this point , one of which has not been mentioned so far , but it is in the Florenz report and has to do with the common agricultural policy . #% Nor will we approve proposals to inflate the size and distort the shape of the Commission - or indeed this Parliament - to avoid concessions to the self-esteem of Member States . #% We should simply adapt as nature intended . #% Two days ago , the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe . #% Mr President , I have to say that I am surprised at how little has been said in this debate about the fact that a people has been liberated , that freedom reigns where terror once did and that Shia clerics are now able to return to Iraq in an atmosphere of religious toleration where once they were murdered . #% I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts , which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings . #% That we have arrived at this point does great credit to him and everybody else who has worked on this dossier . #% One of the ingredients in the pizza that you might eat tonight might be a salami sausage but not every constituent ingredient of that sausage will appear on the pizza-box label . #% The second issue is the policy shift on tolerance levels for small amounts of animal protein . #% A framework has had to be established in order for us to plot Europe 's future . #% The EU believes that nothing should escape manic control . #% These are delicate balances , but Europe gives us the chance to look at many answers that may be available to these problems and to pick the best for the society we try to serve , and we should not be frightened or protective about looking for the best . #% A further important point might have been missed . #% First , it means greater clarity as to what the Union is , how it works and functions . #% The Commission is responsible for the expenditure of all EU funds but , in reality , the power is delegated to paying agencies in Member States . #% I should like to remind colleagues that there are a number of Israeli soldiers and civilians held hostage by forces sympathetic to , or controlled by , Iran and Syria . #% Mr President , to balance the focus on problems and challenges of Turkish membership , can I just welcome the prospect of Turkey 's vibrant and generous culture enriching the European Union , as it already does in North London where I live , not least through the presence of Turkish and Kurdish people as well as the excellent food . #% The macroeconomic dialogue is critical . #% Atalanta 's work in the protection of vessels delivering food aid to displaced persons in Somalia and in protecting vulnerable vessels off the Somali coast is vitally important . #% The spotlight has fallen in particular on the hijab , the Muslim headscarf . #% In part three , it should focus on strengthening the economic governance of the Union , advancing the Lisbon Agenda and strengthening the autonomy of the eurozone . #% The trouble with sweeteners in the additives category is that they excite fundamentalist reactions of exactly the same type as genetically modified organisms . #% I welcome most particularly in that context the Romanian parliamentary team . #% Yet we were faced with wholly unrealistic budget forecast expectations and scenarios which , by definition , could not be fulfilled . #% We have tabled a number of amendments and , when it comes to the main budget debate , more amendments - that we shall be pushing on behalf of our committee - may be tabled by the political groups , because it is about time that someone took responsibility for the problems within Eurostat . #% We need to have more telematics and computer information technology used to advance the efficient movement of goods and passengers throughout the European Union . #% We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics . #% I also want to support very much what you said about the evolution of this type of combination of technology and process -- using the technology to cut through the bureaucracy -- because we hope and we are sure , in fact , that we will need this as the internal market for services develops . #% It seems to me , firstly , that the amount available is far too little and secondly , if we are expecting a doubling of the amount of renewable energy , there should be a sharp increase in the amount of money being made available over a period of time . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and I welcome the Commission 's public consultation on it . #% But , domestically , the European Union must also be consistent and coherent with the policies that it promotes abroad . #% Citizens have a greater negative image from the allegations of the incidence of fraud than for any other reason . #% Finally , we propose to keep the special procedures that were agreed under the so-called Lamfalussy procedures . #% I call upon the industry this morning to join with the Commission to put together a team of all the best talents in engineering and design , together with all other interested persons , to come up with the best tests possible , given today 's technology and not the 1998 technology on which the current EEVC tests are based . #% Madam President , I particularly want to respond to the comments by Mr von Wogau . #% October may see a rejection of the constitution by the Sunnis , but they will then have to get involved in the resulting parliamentary elections and the next constitutional draft , or face a fragmentation of Iraq , in which they will eventually lose out . #% Mr Clegg spent an enormous amount of time just last year on the local loop unbundling rules and I am posing a separate question to you , Commissioner , to ask if you will give an indication of where already we are seeing resistance at Member State level to implementing local loop unbundling . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for coming today . #% Mr President , I apologise to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten that I was not in the Chamber at the moment she began . #% The ECR have decided to vote in favour of the paragraphs which support equality in this way . #% What could do more damage to that than the continued public office of a man with one of the bloodiest records in Latin America 's bloody history ? #% Mr President , I am grateful for the contributions , the compliments and the criticisms expressed so clearly . #% in writing . - UK Conservatives have voted against the asylum package as , while we believe in cooperation in this area , we do not believe in a communitarised approach to asylum and immigration policy . #% The sanctions should be rigorously enforced . #% That seems to me to be the sort of television that we want . #% NATO , the cornerstone of European defence for over half a century and the key organisation for international crisis management missions involving military forces , barely warrants a mention in this report , with paragraph 12 misleadingly subsuming NATO to a role `` within Europe 's foreign and security policy . '' #% However , the current wave of unrest that is spreading rapidly through Britain is , of course , being caused by legal migration and by the European Union 's own rules . #% We do not want a generalised polemic from the Committee of Experts ; we want specific recommendations about what it has discovered not only in relation to the last four and a half years but about procedures that , as we know , have gone on in the European Union civil service for many years . #% But I do not accept the basic thrust of the report that one of the solutions is to strengthen the roles of the social partners . #% Last year I experienced its operation directly , having broken my hand in Brussels . #% It also says why the Charter will become an important building block of the further development of the concept of European citizenship . #% Back in 1970 a third of the world 's ships were proud to fly a flag of a European Member State . #% Finally , a word on the dreaded Spanish hydrological plan which has moved across the screen of the European Parliament increasingly frequently . #% This is to be welcomed , and I know we will return to this many times in the future . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , Commissioner , this report follows on well from the last debate , which was on the general nature of the Euratom Treaty past , present and future . #% 
Attach the food safety bodies of Member States to the authority through an advisory committee comprising the national directors of such bodies . #% It is time to build the widest possible consensus for reform in Bulgaria . #% As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly , I can confirm , of course , that European agricultural policies are currently in direct contradiction with the EU 's declared rural development policies for developing countries . #% The EU needs more confidence about its ability to manage change and remain competitive . #% With these reservations , we support the report . #% I am sure both the President and the Commissioner would agree with that remark . #% There is no doubt that the older cattle , however painful it is , have to be taken out of the food chain . #% Each one of us is probably carrying two or three batteries -- in our phones , in our watches , in our car key fobs and maybe there are even one or two heart pacemakers in this Chamber . #% This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said . #% Indeed , as Mrs Günther has said , I call upon the Council to come to conciliation in order to negotiate with Parliament on these matters . #% First , that for the teachers this decision came like a bolt from the blue . #% Today 's lead story in the Financial Times reports the IMF 's regular world economic outlooks exhortation to Germany to cut its interest rates and so boost economic recovery . #% It can be induced artificially . #% Regarding this one , this conciliated text is in my view a bad compromise on a bad directive . #% America estimates that the greenhouse effect of a one per cent increase in recycling is equivalent to taking one million cars off the road . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal . #% During the last 40 years the seven or eight big household names , the labour-intensive shoemakers in Northampton , have declined to barely one , while all the town 's engineering firms have gone . #% While our attention is understandably focused elsewhere - such as on the Middle East - we tend to forget that there are very dangerous conflicts going on in other parts of the world and therefore tend to do too little about trying to resolve them ? #% I , therefore , wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the Dutch presidency to try to get agreement in this section . #% However - and I say the first part absolutely clearly - I have to express some reservations , not about Mrs Theato 's analysis of the problem but about the remedy prescribed for the problem . #% After all , we are not saying that the changes have to be made now . #% It is quite obvious in my constituency of Shropshire and Herefordshire that , at the moment , our wood industry is under tremendous pressure . #% By the same token , we want to make clear that we are supportive of genuine attempts to improve the position of women in Turkey . #% It would be very useful if national parliaments debated the national action plans that were put forward by governments . #% And that is what we want to see . #% We will not see disabled users being able to take advantage of new technology and new services in the way we would like them to . #% This has actually brought us to this debate here today . #% I think we should take the traditional route , on this issue at least . #% With our very special relationship and with hundreds of British still missing , we too share their desperate feeling of loss . #% I was one of those who was not convinced by the original decision to site the headquarters of the agency in Thessaloniki . #% Mr President , may I , too , congratulate the Irish presidency on the way it has handled the IGC negotiations . #% On the contrary , the attitude towards financing the MEDA programme has much more to do with a desire to ensure efficient , value-for-money spending with proper , generous effects for the people who should be the recipients of such development support , rather than simply having figures on a budget which can look impressive but have less impressive consequences . #% We will still have very high levels of unemployment when we reach the end of this century . #% Given that the arguments are coming from both developing countries and developed countries within Europe , surely a higher sustained price with a managed reduction is the better course of action . #% 70 % of their schools do not have any clean water . #% It is an important piece of single market legislation that establishes uniform technical requirements on a key component of the motor vehicle fuel tank . #% We also need to look at the implications of the current employment policy which not only encourages but actively pushes more people , especially women , into the workforce and away from the caring role they might have fulfilled or the voluntary work they might have done . #% One specific measure in the universal services directive is aimed at ensuring that Member States do not intervene directly in the retail market to try and cap prices unless they have exhausted remedies at the wholesale level . #% This has disastrous effects . #% We are talking about an Internet world where people can shop all over the European Union and where businesses can put out offers to them . #% The Iraqi Government has repeatedly requested different countries , including many EU Member States , to receive them , and we have not agreed . #% Bolivia and Ecuador have also shown worrying signs of following the disreputable example of Chávez and Castro 's Cuba . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , Turkey 's political system is sufficiently mature now to be considered a pluralist democracy . #% I am very glad that he was representing the Council and not Mr Solana , who scuttled out before the start of the debate , and who so badly misrepresented the EU when at the Madrid meeting last July he made a pre-emptive statement in support of Plan Colombia . #% Having listened to the Chair of the Committee , Jo Leinen , I am convinced that at its heart , a multilateral agreement can only be reached if the suspicion of BRIC countries can be removed . #% One British minister admitted that the trade unions and the Confederation of British Industry in the UK had more influence on the national action plans on employment than the British Parliament , which had never ever discussed them - although that situation is now changing , since the new Committee on Works and Pensions came into being - what an exciting name that is . #% Nevertheless some of her proposals , for example the immediate introduction of kerosene tax on VAT or all intra-EU flights or the establishment of a separate emissions trading scheme for aviation , have neither been costed nor impact-assessed . #% That is not unusual . #% Mr President , I add my congratulations to Mrs Maij-Weggen for an excellent report . #% That is the key to the debate on the Lisbon Strategy : are Member States prepared to deliver on their promises ? #% I am sure he would acknowledge , as I do , that the clear winner after this WTO ruling is Chiquita bananas . #% Even if spares were available the government could not afford to repair them . #% I am appalled at their anti-labour movement attitudes . #% Poverty and crime are still continuous reminders of an often weak economic situation for many in Russia , particularly the elderly . #% To put fuel taxes up so much as to make industry uncompetitive while reducing taxes on domestic household energy consumption , is crazy politics and bad economics . #% I represent the West Midlands which has some of the best beef in the world - Herefordshire beef and Shropshire beef . #% An amendment to the law on the Greek national customs code has been adopted by the Greek Parliament . #% Mr President , I have a few points to make , but I can see that the debate has hardly engendered rapt enthusiasm among the packed ranks of Members so I will be as brief as possible and let everybody get away for their dinner . #% - I congratulate my Labour colleague , Simon Murphy , on his recommendation to approve the agreement reached with the Council on tackling late payments in commercial transactions . #% It will label food that contains a substantial quantity of GMO , but it will leave on the shelf in the supermarket many different substances and products that are not labelled , but that contain GMO . #% . Mr President , the enlargement of the European Union means we are having to upgrade from driving a minibus , capable of taking 15 passengers , to a full-sized bus , capable of taking 25 , with some spare seats to take on new passengers in due course . #% First , air transport is growing at a phenomenal rate , with global passenger numbers due to double in less than 20 years ' time . #% We should accord more respect to a Church and a religion on which the values of our Union are founded . #% Fulfilling the promises will not be easy and Africa and , indeed , outsiders such as ourselves , will have to be in this for the long haul . #% They are justified under international law as a legitimate response to prevent a grave humanitarian crisis . #% But we also have to provide back-up in other countries to deal with the processing of arrivals . #% 
I would suggest that one of the roles of Parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place . #% I am talking about the work in the Luxembourg Council today and the Atypical Workers Directive , which has not passed further . #% I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union . #% Because I have that attitude when we look at what is being called for , nothing will happen until we get the statutes . #% When Lithuania joined the EU seven years ago , it pledged to uphold our common values of tolerance and equality . #% But where is the scientific evidence about the medium - and long-term effects of GM crops upon biodiversity ? #% It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles , and for the same reasons : it is centralised ; it is corrupt ; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent ; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats ; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as ` climate change ' . #% I thank the Commissioner for that thoughtful answer . #% We are stumbling around in an economic desert , but rather like the soldiers -- the French Foreign Legionnaires in -- suddenly we have seen a vision : the services directive . #% This is an issue which is of considerable importance to people . #% The Constitution is dead ; the EU has no legal personality ; Europe is not a nation and the EU , therefore , has no place in the United Nations . #% This is not basic aid plunging the developing world into further debt : this is investment -- investment in infrastructure , technology , human capital and the global trading system itself . #% But is it just about updating ? #% In the review now , 10 years on , the Commission is still proposing that the opt-out should continue to exist . #% To get a democratic structure we have to change over the years so that Parliament is not the servant of the Commission but the Commission is the servant of the elected representatives of the electorate of Europe . #% In principle , that is fine , but there is no democratic or judicial scrutiny . #% Where is the ambition to cut CO2 emissions by 50 % by 2050 ? #% This is absurd , blinkered legalism at its worst and does no credit to the lead in Europe that UK race relations legislation has previously given . #% I know you have been doing a lot of work on this yourself . #% Mr President , before I begin my planned remarks , I wish to correct the PPE attempt to rewrite history : the PPE and its right-wing allies voted on Monday to stop Mr Buttiglione being a Commissioner at all . #% However , that being said , I welcome the remarks by the President-in-Office and by the Commissioner and , if I may do so in my humble position , I would like to congratulate her on her maiden speech . #% Selective unilateral punishment missions have nothing to do with the development of international law . #% Mr President , in supporting today 's proposals in favour of small business I want to bring to this Chamber the clear experience of small business in my own constituency . #% Commissioner Byrne , you also talked of not vaccinating in order to safeguard trade ; yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up . #% The answer to that , of course , is that it must be . #% If abolition goes ahead , what advice would he give to the ferry companies operating in my constituency between Dover and Calais ? #% I welcome the prospect of compensation , if it is available . #% Motivation for the arrest was in part to appease anti-western sentiment and distract the people from the government 's economic problems at the time . #% We must work together to define the global energy architecture through innovation and sustainable energy development whilst meeting climate change benchmarks . #% Londoners would be asked to trust the British Government or the Mayor of London to seek postponement when it is genuinely impossible to meet the 2010 deadlines . #% In respect of providing a proper infrastructure for the single market to run on , it is indispensable for us to promote the laggardly implementation of the trans-European networks of transport , telecommunications and energy . #% For Members to attack the purely personal views -- and the right to express those views -- of Commission candidates because they do not comply with their own is an example of intolerance which demeans our Assembly and the parties concerned . #% However , I have severe reservations as regards talking about a European social model at all . #% It would however be a terrible paradox if the main consequence of such an initiative would be to raise borrowing costs for some of the weaker eurozone Member States and contribute to the next crisis . #% You are not accountable and there is no mechanism for the peoples of Europe to remove you . #% If the fishermen do not have quotas , these fish are discarded . #% Mr President , Commissioners , I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas . #% This is useful as a framework directive but I would not like to see lots of further directives springing from it . #% For example in 1996 in the United Kingdom , women who worked full-time earned only 72 % of men 's average weekly wage . #% We believe that the duplication of decision-making bodies and the development of a military staff separate from NATO will inevitably exacerbate policy differences between allies , to the detriment of the transatlantic relationship and the long-term security of our people . #% The two are more or less indistinguishable , both in their effects on human kind and on the animals with whom we share this planet . #% Its protection is the responsibility of national governments , particularly given the threats facing the democracies from terrorism . #% The problem is , Commissioner , that there is a gap between your personal good faith , which I recognise , not to undermine privacy and data protection -- and , indeed , the good faith of the Commission that , in the search for security , you will not forego that -- and the reality of what is happening on the ground . #% Therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from . #% Mr President , I have been the co-author of two resolutions in quick succession with Jas Gawronski and Jacques Santer , who are experts on this very isolated country . #% Unemployment is 20 % . #% I specifically asked the members of the troika to take certain measures and to report back to us . #% The latter is being particularly hypocritical as the Spanish Government was quite happy to ban Herri Batasuna and eject its MPs from the Spanish Parliament . #% The prospect of vast detention camps , raising the spectre of concentration camps , was rightly a step too far for some Member States . #% I thought about it and I bought some old-fashioned , second-hand furniture . #% The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure . #% Mr President , I wholeheartedly welcome the Commissioner 's last statement , which is absolutely right . #% Thirdly , the whole procedure of taking this case raises very important questions , not least the inability of small producer countries fully to present their case equitably and openly at the WTO itself . #% I urge the Commission to be ambitious . #% In each country that budget easing amounted to more than 1.5 % of GDP . #% Can that be corrected please ? #% I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for putting this protective directive before the saving consumers of Europe . #% I am worried that some of the more ambitious suggestions in Mrs Lucas ' report , for example an 80 % cut , are out of proportion to the cost . #% I believe it will be a step forward by meeting all year round , by being elected by a majority from the UN General Assembly , by having a system of suspension for those countries which are members and then violate human rights and by maintaining the tradition of access for non-governmental organisations . #% Mr President , the good news is that the ICC has been successfully established with 139 countries having signed up and the president , prosecutor and judges appointed . #% It is to that end that I hope this implementation report has made some contribution . #% They were not wearing any protective clothing , except against the cold - indeed the clothing that many of them wore was so contaminated by radiation that it had to be destroyed . #% It is not going to be a quick fix for Afghanistan . #% Under such circumstances it would be completely unacceptable for economic sanctions to be maintained . #% Worse still , there remains a foolish determination to proceed with this uneconomic and unstable production of nuclear energy by construction of nuclear plants that could be more economically and safely replaced by the introduction of programmes of energy saving and power production from other sources . #% Secondly , it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment . #% 
It is a slur on the professional integrity of all those involved in the eradication programme . #% They were set out as a threefold proposal . #% Those people have lost everything but are still prepared , in desperation , to leave their country to go to Chad . #% Mr Barroso , I admit I was somewhat prejudiced before I heard you . #% I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that , apart from its own inherent merits , reform will be made necessary by accession , the enlargements , and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in . #% We must put safety first and make sure that harmful substances do not enter the food chain unseen by the back door . #% I hope that this review will be heavily accentuated towards the opening of markets , liberalisation and tearing down economic barriers that still exist in Europe . #% True , the e-commerce directive allows exceptions still subject to national regulation of incoming services , notably insurance in unit trusts . #% Secondly , the national allocation plans . #% Frankly , having a Commission without a representative from France would be fairly implausible . #% Last , but not least , is the question of enlargement . #% The one that raises most difficulty was your ruling on the query raised by the leader of the Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Group and others as to whether the word to be used in the final text is ` banished ' , ' ostracized ' or ` condemned ' . #% However , on behalf of my group I give a warning that in accepting the strict application of the Pact for Stability and Growth , we accept the pact that was first proposed during the Irish presidency . #% As well as the problems my colleague referred to that could occur inside the stadium at Charleroi , there is a serious problem that may occur in the streets around that stadium . #% You can never have 100 % safety , but this proposal will do a lot to make our seas safer , save lives and protect our coastal environment . #% I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner and all those who have taken an interest in the report for being here this evening . #% Mr President , it is pretty clear that what we are involved in here is a one-sided exercise in selling this Constitution to the peoples of Europe . #% I would , however , point out that if we follow him on the substance , then Parliament would be contradicting what we voted both in his own reports and in my recent report on revising the Rules of Procedure . #% It will enable further concrete initiatives to be undertaken , as well as further surveillance and control . #% We need to focus on job creation , which means liberating enterprise . #% And yet we have had a saga that has continued for years rather than months . #% Rhubarb gets a mention as well , but I shall resist the obvious joke , except to say that unlike the EU , the industry does not want to talk rhubarb , it only wants to grow it ! #% We all believe intensely in the importance of social justice and social cohesion , but the greatest social injustice is unemployment : one of the greatest sources of social exclusion is unemployment . #% What they should not be doing in the Balkan countries is trading their sovereignty as though it was a commodity , for that way lies great disappointment . #% Of course this is only possible in an industry like the nuclear industry which is protected and shrouded by secrecy . #% The impact of small - to medium-sized businesses has long been an issue raised by many parliamentarians who want to see nothing but the most positive advantages passed on to companies . #% We call upon the UN Commission on Human Rights , when it meets in Geneva , to condemn the Colombian Government 's failure both to disband paramilitary groups and to protect human rights defenders , both called for last year . #% However , I would like to put to her that in the real world , a Confederation of British Industry survey of over 200 companies in the United Kingdom , which has more temporary agency workers than any other country , indicates that her directive will result in 60 % of these companies employing fewer temporary workers . #% Improvement has been disappointingly slow . #% This is an open door to abuse and avoidance . #% We have done it elsewhere , at great gain to human health . #% As a strong Turkophile , let me be quite clear that , if Leyla Zana and her colleagues are not released soon , it will be impossible for Turkey 's closest friends to argue that accession negotiations should be opened from December . #% We need to bring Europe 's military contribution back into the NATO fold and start rebuilding the common western strategic culture before it is too late . #% Mr President , we generally welcome these reports and their recommendations . #% I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur by leading by example by converting his own classic Harley Davidson motorcycle with a retro-fitted catalytic converter . #% Over recent months I have been subjected to every kind of doom-and-gloom scenario from some airlines and even certain Members of Parliament . #% SLIM seems to have become fundamentally about simplification , even though in the original proposals we talked about limiting costs . #% I support the rapporteur 's other observations about multiannual programmes and the need for greater coordination . #% I particularly welcome the introduction of a system of comparative assessment , which will ensure that some of the older biocides are replaced by safe and more environmentally-friendly substances and that new substances do not pose new dangers . #% I therefore look forward to some genuine action from the European Commission . #% Brazil , along with Mexico , is now designated as an EU strategic partner . #% Compromise Amendment No 25 contradicts this because it calls for a four-year extension on the use of these plants . #% The Government of the Philippines has degraded the military effectiveness of Islamist terrorists in the south-east , and negotiated a peace accord with one group and an ongoing ceasefire with another . #% Let us remember that the buck stops with the Member States . #% Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market . #% No evidence is produced , no trials take place . #% Could you please clarify , Commissioner , what the situation is at the moment as far as the other Member States are concerned ? #% By renovating those structures and systems , in some cases very radically , we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before . #% We should stand up against that as we stand up against unfairness internationally . #% However , curtailing the ivory trade seems to have been successful in preventing a complete wipe-out . #% Whilst it mainly concerned the reallocation of existing funds , it would involve subsidy , by use of the Flexibility Instrument . #% We will be creating a political drama , but Parliament is breathing democracy into the constitutional settlement that we are to sign up to with so much pride in Rome on Friday . #% Unless we are going to have a Commission official monitoring just about every item of European expenditure in the Member States , we are never going to solve the problem . #% Our procedures are also inadequate ; add to that the way in which Member States have showered upon us a host of uncoordinated initiatives , and it is not surprising that two years after the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force , we have a lot of frenetic activity but not enough real progress . #% That is certainly what we , on this side of the House , believe . #% I hope that it will be fully supported in the House tomorrow . #% Why have seven of our members considered signing so-called immunity agreements in opposition to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court ? #% There are serious concerns about what is going on in some third-country waters . #% My Group is concerned about the publication of the code of conduct for not-for-profit organisations and would be interested to know what the basis is for putting that within a context of terrorism and criminality . #% This financing was led by corporate groups bidding for the right to exploit mahogany and native hardwood forestry . #% I would like to quote from a Commission document about how to avoid or minimise new trade disputes . #% It is of no help to anyone for the Turkish Cypriots to be so far behind the Greek Cypriots in income and economic development . #% Mr President , the Socialist Group welcomes very much the official visit to North Korea and to Seoul by the Council , Commission and the High Representative of the CFSP . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would also like to congratulate Mr Lange . #% We should retain the current regulatory framework for the professional bond markets . #% He said that peace has broken out . #% 
The UN has described Gaza as a time bomb whose people are living in a cage . #% Madam President , a number of Members present today will be confused as to what has actually gone on concerning this European Women ' s Lobby amendment . #% What about the Court of Auditors ' report on the EU accounts ? #% I wonder through you , President , if it is possible to ask him if he could explain to assembled masses here how he voted , because it is important that we know . #% In this context we agree that the Commission must be resourced in a way that allows it to play a fuller role in regional fisheries organisation . #% Finally on state aids , we too support revising state aid guidelines to focus more on support for employment , R&D and training , rather than just general state aid provison . #% Over the last three years , great strides have been made in presenting the budget lines for the satellite agencies . #% Safety should never be used as a political football . #% As Budget Commissioner , Mrs Grybauskaitė will have a particular interest in ensuring that parliamentarians are aware of how this money is spent in their countries and also in the Economic Partnership Agreements . #% However , there is a much wider range of issues at stake here . #% That is one aspect of it . #% It is the consumer as tourist who throws away 2 % of their holiday spending money each time to go on holiday inside the EU . #% We attach importance to maintaining a broad consensus on the anti-personnel landmine issue , and therefore remaining focused on what really needs to be done -- making safe those areas in many parts of the world where mines are a threat to the civil population and an obstacle to economic development and assistance to mine victims . #% China is still not a democracy or a respecter of human rights , making security the main responsibility of the UN and it has a vital role to play in the world . #% Nevertheless these matters are done in secret . #% In Vietnam , for example , religious persecution continues and Buddhist monks remain imprisoned and under repressive house arrest . #% And can I have your assurance that I will be able to do so on that occasion ? #% Unfortunately , however , just as we have problems in the common transit procedure , we clearly have common transit problems between the Breydel and the Berlaymont that we must sort out . #% That is a familiar argument in this House . #% Could he also give reassurances that at least the minimum standards that are written into the EU Convention against trafficking are put into that EU action plan ? #% On the internal policies , the medicines ' agency and orphan medicines were one of the issues mentioned . #% It also rejected anything related to researchers , which I understood . #% The Legal Affairs Committee is quite adamant that the Council should not seek to undermine Parliament in this way and we wish to go to conciliation to sort out these difficulties . #% This process goes back to 1993 and has now reached a point where we can set down guidelines which will help the Member States to draw up their action plans . #% It would be slightly surprising if we became more dogmatic and more draconian in our application as a result of what we might adopt today . #% You can not use the term ` light touch ' all the time and then overburden business . #% Finally , we put emphasis on the CFSP in preparing the Commission 's role in that area . #% I very much hope that amendment falls , because had we had that framework the Services Directive itself would have had a far easier passage . #% We need urgently to know what steps the Commission is taking against the French . #% Why can we not see that in your programme ? #% If we use alternative methods - we often talk about alternative dispute resolution systems at European level - these , again , are not backed by a state structure . #% If the EU wants to see a market-orientated approach , I suggest that it follows what we already have in the UK : a tried and tested system . #% The actions about to begin are designed not simply to eradicate terrorism , but also to eradicate an evil regime . #% This situation between Russia and Ukraine has served as a wake-up call to those who may not have been aware how dependent the EU Member States are on imported fuels in general and on natural gas from Russia in particular . #% We all want economic growth and jobs ; we all want the economies of Europe to thrive . #% Speak about Europe 's biggest industry and our decision-makers become indecisive . #% Either way , Ukrainians must be brought closer to Europe , where they rightfully belong . #% Then the Commission appointed four expert groups to mark the first step in the action plan review process . #% As was mentioned earlier , each of us , especially as politicians , can talk a defining moment into a crisis . #% You come from a small country and a small group ; indeed we know that you come from a very small group because you were a group of one when you came from Ireland . #% Across Europe there are many bodies which play a role in protecting citizens ' lives . #% But we have often heard that , with every month that passes , the problems become greater and more difficult to resolve . #% We have to implement the European Citizens ' Initiative over the course of the next year . #% Mr President , on behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the fair , open-minded and assiduous way in which he has carried out his task . #% I too regret the violence that we saw yesterday , but we must understand the frustration that the dockers are feeling at the moment . #% Mr President , the issue of the reform of Rule 6 was raised first by the controversy surrounding the application by the Spanish courts to waive the immunity of two Italian Members of the European Parliament . #% My Amendment No 36 is also part of the compromise text , and for clarity for colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee , this is the amendment you voted on in committee with just the addition of the word ` television ' after ` digital interactive ' . #% We can guard against profit-driven markets that might exploit the vulnerable individual and the possible transmission of disease or infection . #% It is a useful area for comparison between Member States and might at some point be part of another horizontal directive for Article 13 . #% There are five people from the UK whose names we know : Bisher al-Rawi , Jamil al-Banna , Jamal Abdullah , Shaker Aamer and Omar Deghayes . #% The IRA is not the law ! #% The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune . #% That is an indication of where we have got to as of now ; there will be much more to come . #% However , we are under no illusions that so long as certain arms manufacturing nations remain outside the scope of international treaties , then oppressive governments , terrorists and insurgents and other organised criminal groups will continue to have easy access to weaponry . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the excellent work that they have done . #% That was the Commission 's intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport , the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies . #% Annually four million children die before they are one month old . #% Whereas Parliament 's budget is only going up by 13 % , the Council 's by 21 % and the Commission 's by 8 % or 9 % , the Court of Justice , for example , is asking for 57 % . #% I do not want to take up any more time except to genuinely thank the President-in-Office for what I regard as a very positive answer . #% I commend the report and I commend it to the House . #% What is becoming clear to us all is quite simply that present analysis of chemicals and the present chemicals on the market are not satisfactory . #% Finally , it is , of course , important to achieve improvements in nuclear technology , especially with regard to safety of operation and waste management , but my Group takes the view that ` sustainable nuclear fission ' is a contradiction in terms . #% I would also very much like to see a Commission work programme that considered ways in which powers could be returned to Member States , to decentralise power in the European Union , rather than driving forward more integration with the euro and the European constitution , both of which I firmly oppose . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur on the work that has been done on this sensible and welcome proposal . #% We neglect the relationship with India , with its opportunities for both India and Europe , to our mutual cost . #% Nothing should remain outside the scope of these legitimate negotiations . #% 
At present bus services in rural areas , where many people are elderly and rely on public transport , are run by small and medium-sized companies , which the EU claims to be the backbone of the economy . #% Poor water leads to disease and disability and to death and , of course , the loss of a productive workforce . #% The occupying coalition troops and the United States sit out their days in their fixed and mobile fortresses , when on the streets they exhibit the same heavy-handed style currently displayed in Iraq . #% That is why it is so important to oblige Member States to take their responsibilities more seriously , and I welcome the progress made on this point , notably thanks to the Parliament using its muscle during the negotiations with the Council on the new Financial Perspectives . #% The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles . #% The EPLA initiative by Member States , which is optional , embraces some of those steps . #% But it is important to set clear guidelines to stock farmers to ensure that they understand the parameters within which such products should be used . #% As the draftsperson in the Committee on International Trade , I tabled amendments to the cat and dog proposal , not suggesting that we try to include seals - that would be too much - but at least asking the Commission to bring forward similar legislation to deal with imports of seal products . #% We must have the best information about what really took place before events descend into further chaos . #% Either way , we have heard a lot from the Turkish Government about their rights recently , but nothing about their obligations . #% I am sorry to say that , if we are to achieve equality , we must ensure the road is clear of distractions for it is only on a clear road that we can march forward united . #% I think he is spot-on . #% Madam President , regarding conglomerates I would like to support a number of the amendments adopted in committee . #% The black people of Zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism . #% It is , as he said , a means to achieve a goal and I welcome his legal basis of Article 62 ( 3 ) . #% There is undoubtedly an overriding requirement for coordination and a single strategy to deal with the counterfeiters and pirates , but the principles of mutual recognition have not , in my view , been given the prominence I would like to have seen in the conclusions to the report . #% I welcome the Commission 's proposals whereby feed businesses , except those involved solely in primary production , will be required to adopt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles . #% We have , through a lot of hard work , got a better deal for industry and workers alike . #% As the honourable Member would expect , this institution will take account of the breadth of provision and seek to ensure that in terms of accessibility , usability and career security we provide the best possible attainable system to ensure effective whistle-blowing because we believe it to be appropriate as a complement to good conduct in an international publicly accountable administration . #% If that is the case , then why did governments unanimously insert the human rights clause into the EU Treaty and a clause , Article 7 , which provides for sanctions for breach ? #% We have lodged some amendments and we are looking forward to some support from fellow Members . #% We have to combine that with a regime that allows SMEs to use e-commerce in a targeted and effective way . #% I have no personal interest in this , but we need to ensure that there is adequate funding for the Ombudsman to have the staff and resources to cope with the enlargement of Europe . #% So far he has failed to do so . #% The governments have very few cards left to play with and not for nothing has it been said that the euro could lead to a recipe for stagnation . #% This proposal takes no account of the need for flexibility in key areas of the transport sector , pays scant regard to the consumer and is contemptuous of the need for Europe 's industry to remain competitive . #% However , we need to ask in whose interests these anti-dumping duties are being imposed . #% I thank the Commissioner for his statement . #% In my view , that is a very good reason not to permit the EU to sign the convention . #% Let us recognise that the only fishery management schemes that work around the world are the ones with national control . #% Clearly Mrs Jackson has reached that certain age and she now thinks everything in the past better than it is now . #% As the Commissioner will know from the ` falls from heights ' directive , it was pretty clear that we needed a very strong political message to cover the self-employed . #% We have spent an enormous amount of time on significant market power and deciding how to regulate it , instead of actually thinking about the way forward . #% But this is not just some legal argument ; this is above all a political argument - an argument that could even be pursued under the European Convention on Human Rights , concerning the duty of a state to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction . #% I wanted to know whether this great responsibility as chairman of the artistic committee is one that is distributed by some sort of administrative d'Hondt system amongst the officers . #% The new Member States have , broadly speaking , become more Atlanticist , they believe in free markets and low taxation as an approach , which I welcome . #% If we demand the attendance of Commissioners , surely it is right and proper that we demand the attendance of all parliamentarians in this House ? #% I am very happy to hear that this is ` the most liberal report ' and hope that will be on my tombstone one day - though not immediately . #% Indeed , one of the most compelling arguments in favour of the euro is that European citizens are able to compare prices across borders . #% They will have our support when it comes to the vote and we look forward to seeing the Commissioner to discuss both the possibilities and the problems should we fail to meet that target in some respect . #% Can you ensure that the verbatim report accurately reflects what you actually stated , which is now being taped for verification purposes ? #% We have paid in GBP 180 billion and got back GBP 105 billion . #% So action must be taken to maintain and improve safety standards . #% Certainly the Czechs and the Hungarians will well remember Brezhnev 's doctrine of limited sovereignty . #% I personally believe that the present own resources system is opaque and we need something more transparent , so that taxpayers can understand how the EU is financed . #% The arguments deserve careful attention , but we must also be aware of the benefits of phosphates . #% Mr President , I speak as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee and also as shadow rapporteur on Romania . #% So the least bad solution - and I say ` least bad ' - is to allow temporary derogations to non-compliant producers with conditions attached . #% Much has been achieved , much can be celebrated , but there is very much more to do . #% Yesterday he thought that we did need a separate and additional vote , but I am happy that he now accepts that we do not . #% As he may be aware , Commissioner Byrne 's services are actively considering this proposal at the moment and are having discussions with the European industry about that type of marking . #% I raised this matter a few months ago and asked you to consider bringing it before the Council . #% More than 1 , 000 cases are still open . #% It states that the rules of cooperation between national security services should be established at EU level , that effective parliamentary scrutiny of national intelligence services should be at European level and that the Commission should immediately legislate to harmonise laws on the surveillance of non-commercial civil aviation . #% Galileo was sold to the European Parliament as a civil project , and that is what it should remain . #% It is a tremendous vote in favour . #% It is true that covers mainly countries from Central and Eastern Europe , but the candidate countries include the two famous Mediterranean island peoples : the Maltese and the Cypriots . #% It seems to me entirely reasonable to be calling for number portability in the field of mobiles as quickly as possible . #% As more and more people in the European Union live , work , study and spend part of their lives in countries other than the one in which they were born or of which they are nominally citizens , this is going to become more and more necessary . #% The current version of the Members ' Statute is not perfect -- far from it . #% I ask Council to redouble its efforts to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe . #% Mr President , the purpose of this debate is to provide President Borrell with something interesting to say when he speaks at the European Council tomorrow . #% It raises questions of institutional balance , as well as issues surrounding the application of data protection itself . #% Mr President , the President-in-Office says that it is not the Council 's responsibility but that of the Member States . #% Mr President , I must declare an interest because I am a Class I soccer referee and very active in that and have been involved in football at many levels for 18 years . #% There is no mechanism for reviewing current legislation and the regulatory regime - that has been refused . #% 
Sixthly , although my Group understands the thinking behind Amendment No 38 , the fact that it includes private clubs or associations is rather problematical . #% The Socialists asked for a split vote , which retained the training reference but removed my helpful amendment . #% Mr President , I will just simply say first as a British Member , that I would endorse what Mrs Jackson said . #% UK Conservative MEPs will be rejecting all the Hughes amendments . #% There is little evidence that promoting the use of condoms actually prevents the transmission of AIDS . #% I am one of those who has always argued for small boards for these authorities and agencies , as I did for the Food Safety Authority , but in this case there is a fundamental reason why we need to have every Member State represented on the board and that is because every Member State may be asked to contribute to the work of the centre . #% It is decentralization which encourages cooperation rather than competition between actors and equitable agreement at local level on the proper responsibilities of NGOs , vis-à-vis local and cental government . #% Whatever the price of the air fare , they can not afford the holidays at the other end ; but for those of us in a privileged position it is fantastic . #% We have successfully amended both reports , and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote . #% There are very few alternatives . #% It seems that this is an exercise which can bring a real message of accomplishment and achievement to the citizens of the EU , to show that a region dislocated completely by the Cold War can now have harmony , prosperity and stability restored . #% We are in a period of reflection -- and in a period of reflection about the Constitution -- which has begun not on the text but on the context . #% There is also the highly irregular matter of the flax case and EU subsidies for flax growing in certain Member States . #% Mr President , let us put this matter in perspective . #% The Commission representative in Khartoum said to me that our aid to the Sudan is severely limited because of political constraints . #% However , there is a downside to the improvements that we have achieved on land and in fuel quality . #% As the honourable Member correctly points out , such unpaid leave may be granted when the official intends to work for a time in the private sector in order to broaden his or her knowledge and experience . #% On a personal level , however , I feel that regulation of catch opportunities in a mixed fishery by means of both TACs and quotas and an effort regime , based on licences , will lead to the discarding of species for which a quota is not held or where the quota has been exceeded . #% It may achieve its objective of price stability but without openness it will not be clear whether that objective has been attained by design and can therefore be repeated in future or by lucky accident which may therefore require some improvement in its methods of working . #% Until that is clarified , I will make a political appeal to colleagues on the committee as far as possible to allow their colleagues to participate , in the sense of observing , what obviously is politically and agriculturally a very interesting and delicate question . #% Moreover , they are being forced to pay large sums of money - tens of thousands of euros - to pay for new infrastructure and new developments that they do not want and which are on their land . #% Commissioner Patten said that working with the UN confers legitimacy . #% Mr Blair tells people at home that European Union 's defence policy is all about strengthening NATO . #% Europe , of course , is also rapidly catching up with America as a destination of choice for Taiwanese university students and graduates wanting to do research . #% I was not in favour of the two recent ballots on the calendar of sessions 2003 . #% Obviously I would urge you to expedite that research but I also draw your attention to three independent studies already conducted by the UK 's Transport Research Laboratories , the German Federal Highway Research Agency and the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research . #% It seems to me that if we are going to appeal to the young and to society at large , we have to get back to the basic purpose of sport . #% Most manufacturers do not have a product line-up that fits in quite that way . #% The Tampere Summit in 1999 spoke of according similar rights to third-country nationals as those enjoyed by EU citizens . #% The Dutch presidency is going to push for the reinsurance directive . #% Indeed , we have asked the United States to uphold the rights of the free world which are at the heart of its own constitution . #% Of course , if we are serious about conservation , we need total allowable catches . #% But if such a deal can not be struck , they must come back to Parliament so that we can work together to ensure that the EU 's own treaty commitments and obligations on integrating the environment into all areas of policy can take proper effect in the field of aviation . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Madam President , I speak specifically on Mrs Lévai 's report . #% But all the evidence is that the Council and the Commission will not have the courage to do that . #% But laws which are not enforced equally by all 15 Member States will be cynically ignored by those who seek financial gain at any cost and will generate a sense of injustice and eventually hostility in all those who play by the rules . #% I can not see that products which are not new , not the result of some technological freak but as old as sorbates , for example , should be excluded in the way now suggested from dehydrated apples and pears . #% The organisation Disability Awareness in Action has recorded over 2,000 such abuses within Europe and they should be dealt with by human rights monitoring organisations and by the Commission . #% In my own fevered imagination , I have always equated stakeholders with Count Dracula . #% I feel therefore that graduation is needed for some countries that are now independently competitive in this area . #% I hope we can now put this proposal into operation as soon as possible . #% In particular Amendment No 4 encourages the Ombudsman to challenge decisions of the Petitions Committee taken on so-called improper grounds . #% What we spend is a fraction of the cost of defending Western Europe during the Cold War . #% We have to avoid that at all costs , if at all possible . #% The characteristic of this Presidency , Chancellor Schüssel , has been that you have been essentially realistic . #% We have particular difficulties over the question of how the burden-sharing is to be organized and flexibility in relation to these matters . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - President Barroso , why is it that all the focus seems to be upon labour markets ? #% There are 18 million unemployed , as mentioned just now by President-in-Office Gordon Brown . #% Mr President , I agree with all the speakers so far . #% I want to raise with the Commissioner the plight of a factory in my constituency -- ` Dickies ' in Midsomer Norton , near Radstock in Somerset -- whose future and workforce are threatened by any adverse outcome from your services ' current investigation of an anti-dumping complaint regarding protective footwear imported from China . #% This latest EU initiative , complementing others at the national level , will help create the right regulatory framework enabling European businesses to be at the cutting edge in developing electronic commercial services . #% You are right , of course . #% But the British Army , relative to its size , is now more heavily committed than at any time since the Second World War . #% Tonight we are legislating and bringing forward changes that will have a real effect on real lives . #% But , as Mr Howitt has said , this regulation represents yet again the wish of Member States to usurp the executive responsibilities of the Commission . #% In conclusion , I would like to say that we must beware of placing contracts for research work on geographical grounds alone . #% We are very indebted to his hard work . #% Therefore , I urge the Commission to reflect on this quite seriously and not dismiss it as just an add-on to the Lisbon process but place it at the centre of its reflections and perhaps think of new institutional ways of creating an agency specialised in these matters . #% I sincerely congratulate you and the Commission on that excellent package of four bold and ambitious papers . #% It is a price not worth paying . #% But as they did not the EPP will be voting against a number of amendments which were passed in committee . #% Moreover , this year I visited a number of what we call ` difficult countries ' - China , Cuba , even Russia today , parts of the Arab world - where the democracy backlash is moving in . #% It has been a colossal task for Bulgaria to recover from the effects of 50 years of communism . #% author . - Mr President , I was named by one of the Members opposite . #% Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers ! #% I would say to everyone , including the Member States who tried very hard to bring us a common position that we could accept , we still have to try harder . #% 
The ` no ' vote actually stayed the same , the difference was in the ` yes ' vote , and this was the result of the positive engagement by politicians with their people . #% I have put down an amendment with the support of many colleagues and I hope that , in turn , I can persuade Mr van Velzen to withdraw his plea to me to withdraw and also to support my amendment . #% I therefore urge this House to reject the report in its entirety . #% I am sorry that at the beginning of the negotiations I had to be so inflexible and stubborn , but I am pleased to say that once the Greens , for once , started to talk sense , we could also show some flexibility . #% I know that my colleague said that the ELDR Group was against including self-employed workers , but in actual fact we were rather split on this and a sizeable minority of us actually believe that self-employed workers should be included . #% This was another example of where funding from Europe can materially assist projects for employment and for environmental concerns . #% Meanwhile , outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely . #% I call upon the Council to grant a political mandate to the EIB for the first time to extend its operations to Ukraine and Moldova in expectation of their eventual EU candidatures . #% However , in this day and age I am astounded that the Commission believes that it knows best how retailers and shoe companies should run their businesses and how much they should be charging their customers . #% I say that because I have had a letter from one of my fellow chairmen actually complaining about this procedure , but we thought it was a fair way of proceeding and one that would give everyone a chance to have their say . #% We have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits . #% A matter of hours ago we voted on the Figueiredo report . #% We agreed with the Commission and the UNHCR that it was appropriate to deal with the two categories together and not just for administrative reasons . #% Their citizens are more comfortable with the process and the final result has increased legitimacy . #% My concern here is not just that compensation should be paid quickly - which has not happened at all in the past - but that a code of practice should be accepted by all Members of the Council . #% We are eating too much fat , sugar and salt , and it is contributing to heart disease , diabetes , increased risk of cancer , strokes , liver disease and even depression . #% It will work closely with national networks and no national network need feel threatened by this because they will fully be a part of it . #% Mr Prodi writes : ' I am convinced that the solution we offer is the most suitable in the light of the specificity of the case and I am disappointed that your constituent does not see it this way ' . #% I want to look specifically at the four headings that Commissioner Bangemann identified in his new communication which , no doubt , we will be discussing in this House in two years ' time - because of the length of time it takes us to deal with things . #% I told him that Parliament did indeed want to see the programme wound up . #% The Commissioner should be asking what is going to happen to the 100 and more ships that are leaving EU waters this year to be dumped and destroyed in the Third World in a totally unacceptable manner , rather than making remarks about things being done properly by the British . #% Is the agenda , as some feel , already decided in advance ? #% What they are actually doing is lifting up the carpet for the Commission to sweep its problems under . #% But in discussing this issue , it is not acceptable simply to say that the problems of Cyprus started with the Turkish invasion in 1974 without mentioning the divisions of the island from 1963 when Greek Cypriots murdered Turkish Cypriots . #% For example , it is no good having an accessible train if people can not get into the station . #% I hope the Commission and the Council will assist us in these aims . #% That was a procedural matter not actually related to the report itself . #% We needed specific legislation to address this problem , as they have in the United States and in parts of Spain , and it works there very effectively . #% We are not being shamefully silent , as Mr Crowley said , on the impact on national law . #% The message from my group is very clear , we must keep following that road map . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office about the question of investment . #% If we can encourage the national parliaments and national authorities to give more information , then we have some hope . #% It is much better to talk about controlling the trade than to suggest we stamp it out . #% This proposal could produce modest environmental benefits , but we must make sure that those modest environmental benefits do not come about at the expense at the loss of hundreds of jobs in many small enterprises across Europe and the pricing of many European citizens off the waterways which they have enjoyed for many hundreds of years . #% I believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well . #% It has not been our task to attempt a re-negotiation of fundamental parts of the package . #% We did it by ourselves , by making our town attractive to the service sector . #% I am sure Mrs Thyssen - if she speaks later - will explain its merits so that her own group can understand it . #% Extremism is still a current threat and these extremists have an unwitting friend in the ballot box - lethargy . #% Equally , I have tabled in my own name and that of my group , Amendment No 13 , which envisages a six-monthly review , carried out by Parliament , of progress that has been made on the legislative programme . #% The Essen Summit laid the basis for a conference which brought together the real parties who must cooperate if the fight against fraud is going to be successful . #% What is to happen if the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights develop contradictory case law ? #% In our committee it is always very difficult to get interpretation into the mother tongue from even large countries -- Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic ; countries that are now at the heart of our European Union . #% They are desperate for help to combat the WTO ruling , an action that had the full might of the American Government behind it . #% I too should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer . #% In short , the report seeks to strengthen the role and function of the Agency , which has already done excellent work . #% It is almost as shameful as this resolution before us , which just highlights species after species facing extinction : a real reflection of mankind 's failure to plan for the future . #% Fundamentally , Palestinians ask : is the EU about democracy or suppression ? #% It is very easy to say that there is no problem or that , if there is , then it is someone else 's problem . #% I wonder whether the Commission would agree that those steps might be taken at the end of the studies ? #% I would also add that , in its 2002 Activity Report , the Director-General of DG Press felt compelled to enter a reservation about the management of the relays because it was not possible to guarantee , with the resources at its disposal , proper monitoring and control of a relatively high number of small grants . #% All our gains , including codecision on future moves will be lost and the Commission will then move in under Article 80 - as I am sure they are keen to do - and give us full liberalisation sooner rather than later . #% Where is the demand for improved military capabilities and greater political will by European states and where are the measures to be taken against those that support terrorism ? #% It is like watching a slow-motion car crash and now you want a permanent bail-out mechanism . #% The major thrust of the Colom i Naval report is to ask the question : how can the EU continue the excellent work of the ECSC when the Treaty expires in 2002 ? #% If it is a matter of human rights , we have every right to interfere ; that is our job . #% The Commissioner has rightly drawn attention to the problem of air pollution . #% Mr President , I wish to give an explanation of vote to explain my extreme concern over the Eurostat scandal and the European Commission 's failure to take responsibility . #% For obvious overriding political reasons the Council and Parliament must reach a political agreement about the two together . #% Since the publication of the Hughes report , I have been personally bombarded with complaints from the UK Removers ' Association , the Confederation of Passenger Transport , the Road Haulage Association , the Freight Transport Association and the International Road Transport Union , as well as small local haulage companies and self-employed lorry drivers . #% Therefore , we can not logically oppose these contributions . #% These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice of giving their lives for their country . #% Then we can proceed to extend Lamfalussy , again on a temporary basis . #% I will keep a very careful eye on this and report back to my Spanish colleagues . #% They are already paying for the cost of the EU 's common agricultural policy . #% On the question of the United Kingdom rebate , I believe that it is justified and certainly I am going to look carefully at the position taken up by our Prime Minister , Mr Blair , at the European Council next week . #% 
Most will be exhausted , many disorientated , frightened or frail . #% The study of accessible buses commissioned by my own government shows low operating costs outweighing the marginal extra capital costs , while a 14 % increase in passengers brought in extra revenue . #% Overall , it was a general insult to Muslim citizens and residents of the European Union . #% You underlined the fragile nature and environment of the Arctic . #% No doubt Europeans wish that for Mediterranean countries , and this morning President-in-Office Steinmeier expressed the view that the EU should deliver in areas where people want it to . #% Let me come to the delicate task of trying to get a balance in the vote on amendments so that all parts of this House can support this report . #% Muslims are as committed to peace and non-violence as all other religions -- and none -- in this world . #% I have some difficulty with the issue of the rule of law . #% We have a huge over-supply in our unskilled labour market . #% This is because Amendment No 8 was adopted , reintroducing the concept that Parliament rejected last year - setting noise target values and charges for airports rather than just for aircraft . #% In thanking colleagues , allow me to mention that people will also welcome the fact that this is a major achievement under the British Presidency . #% Be we know , sadly , that these 25 , 0-26 , 000 jobs will not be the last that will have been lost . #% The Commission refers the honourable Member to the statement given by Commissioner Wallström to the plenary session of this House on 17 January . #% With regard to the Marco Polo programme on transfer to other modes of transport , away from road traffic and the congestion which it causes , I give that my full support . #% I should like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen and his staff for the consistent concern and attention they have shown with regard to this important issue . #% People have to come to realise that the so-called liberators have become their jailers . #% I spoke to the official there today , who complained that not a single Member has shown any interest in reading the declarations or signing the book , even though the procedure is now much easier and more convenient . #% I will take questions 2 and 3 together . #% It should be about what works . #% There is no such thing as the ` Constitutional Treaty ' . #% My colleague , Frederick Ries , says that not all vitamins are safe , but of course you can kill yourself on anything if you eat enough of it . #% This follows on from my previous complaint to the President , Mr Borrell Fontelles , asking for this matter to be investigated . #% We need to look at the issue of missile sales and testing , and the linked inevitable missile exports . #% Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of our chairman , Mr Brok , of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% We must recognise the fundamental importance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and we call on the EU Presidency to address this important issue . #% I was in Zaghreb last week discussing Croatia 's accession with Liberal colleagues , and they told me that Croatia imports 50 % of its energy and also uses twice as much energy as it would do if proper energy efficiency measures were in place . #% One of the most significant of these is the fact that it has broadened from a focus on trade alone to a wider emphasis on development cooperation . #% That is a tiny amount . #% If we are to meet our target of making the European Union the most competitive economy in the world by 2010 , and make it as easy for EU citizens to move from one Member State to another , as it is for US citizens to move from one state to another in the United States , then we need a free flow of European nationals moving between countries to live and work . #% Not least , how we begin to set in train an interinstitutional process that will look at long-term trends and that will enable us to get the right budgetary analysis , because without that , it is really difficult to plan ahead . #% In addition , I did draw attention in my first answer to the strong distinction that has to be made between possible consequences of the use of depleted uranium material and munitions in a land environment where the oxides can be inhaled , and in a maritime environment where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium do not have the same consequences , since obviously no inhalation can take place . #% My suspicion is that what people were talking about during this time was simply the harmonisation of a process - a neat bit of packaging around a policy that could be fitted onto an institutional shelf . #% Mr President , I should like to say at the outset that we are considering this proposal tonight after a delay of four years in bringing forward an effective amendment of the misleading advertising directive . #% This is why we are today , eight years on in the European Parliament , having a debate about two reports which deal with irregularities and fraud . #% His local Member of Parliament - a senior cabinet minister - led the protests . #% We would rather have seen a framework directive on social services , but will nevertheless be looking to see whether the proposals brought forward also take into account the effects of existing European legislation on the future of services . #% Why does your re-election for five years as Commission President have to take place now ? #% It is important that this House supports the principle that each case should be discussed and judged on its merits alone . #% Long life and a healthy life have to be earned . #% Rather than talking in grand terms , let me give a specific example . #% We wish to expand on our reasons for supporting the key principles of the Roth-Berendt report today . #% Some of the reports of what happens when these cases are brought to court are quite horrifying . #% Mr Pasty questioned whether there could be a conditional discharge . #% Compensation , however , will need to be considered for those whose properties were expropriated as a necessary prelude to a resumption of meaningful negotiations over a final political settlement . #% But I want to draw attention to something else . #% They want to follow their team . #% The fact that many who oppose President Musharraf were elected surely speaks for itself . #% That is why the international community should continue to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone by providing secure jail facilities in the Member States , if necessary and when required , for jailing convicted tyrants . #% Mr President , we are taking action as a Parliament , as a European Union , to make our seas safer because of tragic events like the loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise , the Scandinavian Star , The Estonia and , most recently , The Erika . #% As far as the revision of Part III is concerned , I am prepared to turn myself into a technician , pure or not , for the final phase of the work . #% I take up your invitation Mr President and I should look forward to the visit very much . #% This is an issue of concern to millions of constituents in Great Britain and certainly to thousands of my own constituents who have links with Kashmir . #% My second point is that tonight we are pursuing a strategy which has been under way since 1997 , when we adopted the employment strategy at European Union level . #% We have to turn Lisbon into something that means something to them , something to the people in my home town of Wolverhampton . #% We can cut the cost of production through less inputs and treatments and , crucially , we can increase the numbers of people working this sector . #% I come from a country where it is generally regarded that retrospective law is bad law , that people should always have the certainty of knowing under what rules and regulations they perform their duties . #% It is a role we have tried to avoid . #% It appears that people feel that they are being pressurised to withdraw signatures . #% This morning , and in recent days in particular , we have read and heard a lot of allegations . #% It is highly regrettable that there is a difference for the citizens of Gibraltar . #% The first aspect - taking my life in my hands - refers to some of the amendments of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities . #% Furthermore the European Union has the expertise to help with other problems in Bangladesh - the flooding that we have heard about , that destroys great swathes of the land on a regular basis is not inevitable . #% We want action and we want it now . #% If they want rightly to link social and environmental concerns with trade they will need both to prove that their motives are not protectionist and to deliver substantial gains for developing countries in return . #% Instead it attempts to bribe its way to a position of favour . #% Well , if that is the case , the message needs to go out now loud and clear that we will have the same bumpy ride with the budget this year that we had last year and you will not win . #% 
Frequently there is insufficient business for those plenaries , so we pad out the agenda . #% I very much hope that this study will be completed . #% Before we are too congratulatory I would , however , draw attention to the problem of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour . #% We can not allow those calls for cost-benefit impact assessments to be used in that way . #% in writing . - Whilst we favour cooperation between Member States on these issues , we believe this matter should remain one of subsidiarity and not subject to EU action . #% Recital L questions the holdings of tactical nuclear weapons in five European non-nuclear states . #% Mr Brüner is an immensely controversial figure and his judgement has been brought into question on many occasions . #% No objection was raised by the French back in May when the International Veterinary Organisation adopted less rigorous conditions than those foreseen by the date-base export scheme . #% Indeed , now that the Commission has acceded to the protocols of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva , which has been where the bulk of motor vehicle legislation in Europe is handled , we are faced with another set of issues - most of which are being handled in the Industry Committee at the moment - where Parliament does not have the right of amendment as we have with this sort of directive . #% You know very well that it is going to do nothing except mouth a few words and take no tangible action ! #% It is made even more complicated by the fact that the age when school children start statutory education also varies from Member State to Member State . #% There is that health and safety have been compromised in any of these circumstances . #% The current opt-out is open to all Member States . #% I look forward to hearing more detail about the European Charter for micro-enterprises - that should be very interesting when it comes forward . #% Therefore they have an enormous interest in the appalling suggestion that we should pull back on our commitments to Everything But Arms . #% As one of my colleagues has mentioned , GMO agriculture would enable us to actually produce a plant which is resistant to many diseases and could be sprayed a great deal less . #% I should like to say how much I have enjoyed spending my Wednesday afternoons in the company of Mr Henderson for the last six months . #% Yet the owner was able to tell me that the problem was not the quotas for these species , but that because of the 10 % legal by-catch the industrial fisheries could take out more of the fish stocks than the people with legitimate quotas . #% We need a strong civil society , as Commissioner Frattini pointed out , one which is democratic , in which people feel they can participate and are not excluded on the basis of their race or religion . #% To repeat one other point I made in the first debate on this issue , I would remind the Council that the Interinstitutional Agreement is only an interinstitutional agreement when the institutions keep to it between themselves . #% We know that Mr Solbes Mira has resigned from the Commission but not over this issue , so there is still a complete failure on the part of the European Commission to take responsibility for this waste of taxpayers ' money . #% I should like to emphasise one or two things that have been said and look at them from a slightly different perspective . #% Women want to be able to make independent choices about their careers or their family aspirations : the choice to work in a traditionally male occupation or , equally , the choice to look after children and work in the home . #% It is vital that we are consistent in our approach to public safety and to the collective peace of mind throughout the Union . #% But the situation regarding this particular directive is unusual and serious . #% Like the British Government , we believe that Europe must face up to some profound questions . #% I congratulate the Irish presidency on its work and I hope that we can continue our efforts to bring peace to the Middle East . #% Many colleagues speak of terror , but is it not the case that the hand of extremists has been considerably ... #% I would ask Members to bear that in mind in the light of what the rapporteur said in his introductory remarks . #% I am clear at this stage - and my group will vote against it - that those provisions should not cover ` must carry ' provisions and we will be voting against that section of that amendment tomorrow . #% That is an indication of the distortion in spending which we need to address , and in particular the priorities with which I hope the European Parliament will play some part in helping the Commission in the coming years . #% As we heard very clearly from our rapporteur , we need one that will be in our interests and the interests of our electorate and that is what we hope will come out of the Council in a few days ' time . #% However , yesterday 's Minutes refers to the wrong paragraph and thus the vote does not reflect what actually took place in this Chamber . #% We should encourage the UN Human Rights Commissioner , Mary Robinson , to install permanent observers in Burma to monitor human rights . #% Let us accept a duty to negotiate this package on time . #% On Cyprus there is a one-sided interpretation of events with no recognition of the positive steps taken by the Turkish Cypriot authorities , no call for generosity by both sides . #% It protects small savers and small savers ' savings . #% We welcome much of the report in terms of the rights-based approach , which I would like to see leading on and away from the view that it is only about criminal justice . #% We want the President-in-Office 's assurance that the stability pact will fit exactly with the terms and the spirit of the Treaty on European Union and also that when he presents that stability pact to this House during his presidency he will ensure that it also fits in exactly with the priorities of the Essen Summit . #% What we are working on now will mean that temporary agency work will also become a positive option in the future . #% I am the only one left here . #% But I am confident , as are many other Members of this House who know the Lebanon well , that the energy and the determination of the Lebanese people will win through . #% The old ones were getting very noisy and very expensive . #% But surely , common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively re-examined . #% I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately . #% Could we please have that undertaking from the Council now , in the interests of the transparency which Finland no doubt wants to be the hallmark of its presidency ? #% Slowly but steadily we have been taking on powers and becoming , I hope , more effective . #% For example , I am pleased that lump sums are specifically allowed . #% We should also perhaps say in the absence of Council that the negotiations there have been tough but fair , and we have a very good outcome . #% Finally , I am very pleased about what the rapporteur says about international fishing agreements . #% Have those barriers come down yet ? #% We have the challenge of the external frontiers , to which he referred . #% They should be insulted by the implication that NGOs were able to manipulate and manage their opinions in the way that some have said . #% Here in the European Union and the European Parliament , we should be proud of our record on passenger rights . #% On the implementation of the provisions of Article 7 - the point that Mr Needle referred to and that Mr Cabrol is extremely interested in as well - the Commission will pay particular attention to ensuring that expenditure relating to the committee which will assist the Commission is determined in strict application of the rules of financial prudence , in particular as regards the number of experts deemed necessary for the proper implementation of this decision . #% If there are hundreds of channels , people need to be able to access the information they are after quickly and easily rather than flicking through channels in a way which we have done previously with conventional television equipment . #% Holidaymakers driving from Bolton to Barcelona must be protected on a legal basis . #% We still see child labour , serious union repression and predominantly low-paid women . #% Both scenarios would be a little bit odd unless they were subject to an agreement among the three institutions . #% Mr President , the UK Environment Agency has revealed that in five months of this year 12 million cubic metres of raw sewage were discharged into the river Thames flowing through London . #% The EU is the of the accountable parliamentary democracy that the British invented over 700 years ago . #% A lot of the proposals and a lot of the amendments by the Socialist Group , which I am sure we will reject tomorrow , reflect the old mentality of trying to tell consumers what is best for them . #% So why was it extended ? #% The market for British wood - and only a tiny part of the British market is actually supplied from within the UK - has actually contracted by some 25 % . #% I would also like to thank Mrs Aaltonen for her excellent work on this report . #% This is a time of real celebration for all Romanians . #% 
That is why I am proud to stand here and say that if we allow this to happen in Portugal , what happens when there is another government that has another view about opinions that are different from their own ? #% Everything has to be seen through this focus . #% Mr President , I strongly welcome the trip by President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn as a visible demonstration of our commitment to the western Balkans ' EU future . #% It is also becoming more important because , in the wireless connected world , we will increasingly have more devices feeding information about ourselves , houses and cars into the system . #% The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers , the VNO-NCW , wants to reintroduce flexibility . #% There you were at the Summit last week , the tough British Prime Minister , and I am sure that millions of people at home were watching the early evening news saying there he is ! #% I agree entirely with Mr Bradbourn that we should not just go for large schemes , because out there the logistics industry - and I applaud its efforts up and down the country and across all countries in the European Union - has a lot of ideas that it wants to start up . #% The new licences will make certain that police officers will be able in the future to appreciate and understand the information contained in them . #% They constitute consumer fraud and a public health scandal . #% Mr President , the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so . #% I join with colleagues who have said how dangerous this is as a concept . #% Furthermore , I hope that the easing of travel restrictions by the Turkish Cypriot authorities between the two parts of Cyprus will be reciprocated by the Government of the Republic to enable the free movement of all people coming from the north . #% The procedure has worked well . #% Although few will know it as the fireworks explode outside tonight , it is a very good reason for those of us here to enjoy some quiet celebrations for the introduction of what is a modest but important measure , and to thank all those responsible for achieving it , which I now do . #% Those things seem to me to be enormously important . #% Could we also investigate whether we are within the law with regard to employment ? #% Mr Andreasen is absolutely right to say that the EU must concentrate on factual information . #% It is vitally important that we come to this agreement . #% I and other colleagues wrote to Commission President Prodi on this point two months ago . #% As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco , and 85 % of lung cancers are caused by smoking . #% If this debate does one thing at least , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and others have said , it may impress upon us that the Member States need to be able to do this . #% Mr President , I have a point of order under Rule 9 and Annex 1 of our Rules of Procedure on a code of conduct for Members . #% This kind of blanket discrimination must be abolished . #% What worries me is that the Commission is committing a fraud on the people of Europe and the people of Indonesia and Asia . #% Of course there is no reason , as has been said by the Council and the Commission , why the transition should not go well . #% In particular , I congratulate the Commission on the way it addresses the problem of waste . #% I hope the present contretemps about TRIPs and possible barriers to the most modern medicines will be overcome very shortly . #% The EPLP maintains its position on the issue of corporate taxation , which is not to support a recalculation of the corporate tax base . #% The honourable Member is right to indicate that the spur for migration - indeed including legal migration - is frequently poverty and the sense of hopelessness about the future that makes people desperate enough to uproot themselves and to seek to move to countries with which they have no familiarity either in terms of language or custom . #% It seems to me that , finally , in the remaining amendments , following in the tradition of tidying up texts for the purpose of clarification , Parliament 's rapporteur has maintained the type of quality we have come to expect from experienced Members . #% The buses are only part of it . #% Mr President , like others who have already participated in this debate I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs , but in particular Mr Bourlanges . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I think many of the recent incidents and the shocking pictures that we have seen of a small boat towing people in its net , are the result - as we have been hearing - of a catalogue of failures , many of them absolutely avoidable with a bit of forward planning . #% The whole objective of this is to clarify the existing situation because the current patent law is being applied in an inconsistent way . #% Mr President , it may well be that 100 years ago our cities resounded to the noise of iron wheels and iron hooves bouncing off cobbled stones . #% Is anybody prepared to really talk about the fact that the auditors have refused to sign off the accounts for 11 years in a row ? #% I regret that we have given the impression in this Parliament that we are against stem cell research . #% However , the citizens of Europe -- especially those in Britain -- are waking up to what is going on . #% Instead , the Commission has produced this proposal - I think it is 1049 - part of which actually restricts access to documents that are currently public . #% Without prejudice to the notion of subsidiarity , there are times when we need to act on a Union-wide basis where action at a Member State level will not suffice to protect tourists . #% Nevertheless , humanitarian aid must continue through the World Food Programme and ECHO . #% But once we have a completed result from the Convention the battle then moves on to getting it intact through the IGC . #% I would like to see some clear responses and some action regarding the proposals made by the Parliament both last year and indeed this time around . #% We trust each other more and are more trustworthy for the citizen and the outside world . #% In view of Mr Bolkestein 's statement that Amendment No 13 will be accepted by the Commission , I believe this is a very important clarification and I would ask that it be accepted . #% For that , the EU will have to cope with competition on the free world markets , but you are not prepared for that . #% So the proposed review process becomes essential . #% Mr President , for us the problem of implementation should be a shared problem , and I personally can not accept what Commissioner Barnier has said , when he simply washes his hands of the problems of four or five Member States . #% They do not wish to give their destiny , their independence and their sovereignty to a group in Brussels , or indeed in Strasbourg . #% It is thus something which we are not accustomed to , which we do not like and which we are very uncomfortable about . #% The problems highlighted concern categories 4 and 5 and I would like to bring to Members ' and Parliament 's attention the fact that these issues were raised with the Spanish presidency at the trialogue meeting to try and find some sort of solution . #% I hope that I can have an assurance that the revised document will be made available in time for Parliament to consider it and to express any views before the next meeting of the Judicial and Home Affairs Council . #% It is in the spirit of Amsterdam , Commissioner , that we are all addressing you today . #% Having said that , the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium - new needs , enlargement on the horizon - and to make it function effectively . #% Over these last four years I have had the pleasure of being Chairman of the Committee on Budgets . #% This directive should also be welcomed because it deals with issues around the legal dimension and legal certainty : with where responsibility for follow-up treatment lies ; with the question of redress if there are problems ; and with issues around ensuring that procedures are carried out by qualified medical professionals . #% That makes the Council often think that we are profligate with taxpayers ' money . #% Individuals choose the right of privacy and then legislation backs it up . #% Secondly , the cost calculation method is included in the criteria . #% I would ask the Council to give some indication as to what they will be proposing for a legal base for the early retirement scheme . #% That is a very serious matter indeed and I hope you will investigate it fully and report back to this House . #% But the supply of blood is also paramount for those whose lives depend on it . #% Colleagues themselves will decide whether these two compromises are acceptable to them or not . #% Commissioner , I have attacked you vociferously on three previous occasions for not taking a decision , because I thought you were weak . #% However , referring to this case is inappropriate in a report dealing specifically with the Kashmir dispute . #% I hope it will indeed be robust and that the option of initiating urgent consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement will be borne in mind if progress is not forthcoming . #% 
It is worth bearing in mind those words and repeating them for the record , particularly for the consumption of US observers . #% But certainly some of them are macroeconomic , as reflected in this debate . #% So much for the separation of powers of the executive , legislative and judiciary that has protected English freedoms for centuries ! #% Unless this is achieved , unless the slide towards a form of apartheid in Fiji , where Indo-Fijians who comprise nearly half the population are rapidly becoming second-class citizens , driven from their homes and jobs , is stopped , then we should demand support for sanctions against the current government . #% The second surprise is to see Commissioner Liikanen , after I praised him yesterday . #% The plain truth is that too many people use these arguments . #% Many people do not agree with that war and I respect their views but I ask that this Chamber respects the position of the men and women whose lives are at risk . #% The best hope for the future may be universal education , which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation . #% We now have a new French presidency - I do not know if anyone is there representing them - but I commend to the Council the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment with a large majority . #% The procedures whereby such products come in and out of the European Union have to be open , transparent and , above all , safe . #% The Labour Government is likewise at the forefront in creating the right environment for e-commerce to thrive . #% Parliamentarians do not have to refer to Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 in order to gain access to documents . #% Monitoring over such a short period of time is incompatible with real-time analysis . #% I would like to know whether those options are within the rules or whether we are looking at a change in the rules . #% In fact , the MED programme became the ` MAD ' programme . #% I particularly emphasise the issue of corruption and organised crime , on which there are clear and well-defined benchmarks for measuring progress . #% There are many leftovers from Rome II that form the basis of studies that I hope the Commissioner will mention in his declaration - studies on road traffic accidents , on defamation , and on the treatment of foreign law . #% We in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues , but at the moment we do not have it . #% We recognise the importance of the UN Commission as a forum to effect real change , but we feel that the Council , Parliament and the Commission must act together if we are to achieve our real aims . #% I call upon Chairman Arafat to condemn , regularly and in Arabic , the terrorist attacks , and recognise Israel 's right to exist in peace behind its 1967 borders . #% Consequently , whilst I understand the argument for conditionality and in many cases would take that to its logical conclusion , the Commission can not be certain that that approach would , in these circumstances , lead to the outcome that Members of this House and of the Commission would want . #% They are not perfect and we expect to see improvements in second reading as the Council further refines European thinking on this important topic . #% It remains open to Mr Davies ' group to follow suit and follow our lead in putting the register of interests on the Internet . #% More importantly , having now confirmed that every allegation levelled by Mrs Marta Andreasen was correct , where was the part - maybe I missed it in your statement - where you apologised for the personal slurs on Mrs Andreasen 's background and character , made on and off the record by your press service ? #% Nonetheless we need to ensure that we get the minor amendments properly sorted out before embarking on the more wide-ranging reform which we will see in the Solvency II regulation . #% We need a free and open press in an election , where journalists feel safe to say and write what they want . #% It is therefore a very welcome step . #% My French colleagues who are going off for their very good lunch now should remember that this Parliament will only legitimise itself when it can choose where it sits . #% I note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace . #% The reason for the lay-offs at Genk is because demand for one of Ford 's largest models has fallen off dramatically . #% There is another thing I want to know , because I have no sense of this whatsoever . #% Has the British Government applied for funding to help the revaluation of the pound ? #% Amendments Nos 25 and 35 should state ` public interest ' and not ` public order ' as has been translated . #% However , the global economic crisis has led to budget cuts in the education sector in Member States across the European Union . #% French cities are now under siege due to new youth employment policies . #% Our motion now clashes with the Presidential debate where most of our colleagues are . #% By and large , their pleas have been rejected . #% Madam President , I should like to start by congratulating Mrs McNally for her persistence in keeping this report on Parliament 's agenda and bringing it to fruition . #% Hence the transmission . #% We wish it to be eradicated where it is and certainly wish too that no other country should suffer as some of our plants and woods are already suffering . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency and , in particular , the Prime Minister and the Irish Finance Minister , for the progress that was made on economic and monetary union . #% Not one of those organisations covered by budget lines 3021 or B3-2005 has received a single euro yet in 1999 for their budgets . #% Mr President , I am happy to take your assurance . #% It is a test of your commitment to this agreement whether you do so . #% That is why the Treaty changes agreed in Amsterdam are equally important : for the first time it will be possible simply to adopt common principles for the European elections , rather than a completely uniform system . #% When we bring all those factors together we see that the death penalty in the US is an arbitrary process and is fundamentally a racist process . #% This split does not provide value for money to EU taxpayers , nor does it serve our foreign policy interests . #% In the energy and transport sectors there are major contributors to global warming emissions . #% As Wim Kok 's report has shown , there are too many people excluded from the labour market and we are building a wall between those who have a job and those who do not have a job . #% Thank you again for your report . #% Having been informed by the Canadians , inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement . #% Madam President , ten years ago this week , our Sakharov prize winner , Aung San Suu Kyi , was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . #% This Parliament enthusiastically endorsed the Agenda 2000 Structural Fund programme . #% It is a good target and , if it is at all possible , then it should be retained . #% It was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate , let us be clear on that . #% I spent some hapless years working as a junior official in the TACIS programme some years ago . #% Parliament would be well-advised to give it splendid and resounding support tomorrow and I am confident it will . #% A number of people have made critical comments about the nuclear programme in the Community . #% That is a balanced , fair package with give and take . #% Yesterday the PPE spokesman approached the Socialist Group to ask us to withdraw my Amendment No 1 because , if it were accepted , they would be unable to support the report . #% We can not develop a whole series of initiatives based on , for instance , small businesses or health on-line or whatever without educating people to be literate in those technologies . #% In other words , what we are talking about here is an amendment to cut out the offending elements of the patent , thereby rendering it lawful , and not its revocation in its entirety . #% I would ask the Commission to renew its efforts to clarify the legal basis for some areas of action in the field of the environment . #% The election results were a cry from the streets . #% The Commission has long recognized that women are undervalued and under-utilized in the SME sector . #% Our citizens are increasingly finding themselves involved in complex cross-border problems : road traffic accidents , buying property or a timeshare , actual problems that face our citizens . #% 
But then Commissioner Wulf-Matthies facilitated a common position with Parliament and so we feel that the time is now right for us to start work with the Commission as it becomes more active , positive and decisive . #% My own country used to be governed by a party that treated every summit meeting as though it was a combative exercise with our neighbours in the European Union . #% I am a homosexual , born to an ordinary man and woman . #% I had then led a group of students to Rome to demonstrate outside a European Council meeting in favour of having -- novel idea -- direct elections to this European Parliament -- one of Spinelli 's main campaign themes at that time . #% Our enthusiasm must not blind us toward the many problems that come with Malta . #% Nevertheless , of course , we do now welcome the PRC 's expressed desire for having much better and harmonious relations with its ethnic minorities and , in particular , the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities . #% A future directive on pipeline safety and a proposal with regard to tunnel safety will also be very welcome because they respond to promises made during the last reading in 1994 and also to events , some of them very tragic , that have occurred consequently in other parts of the Union . #% Industry should pay and face the consequences of its actions , not the man-on-the-street . #% Now we have to move away from that , we have to overhaul it , and I hope proper reporting mechanisms to committees will be part of that overhaul . #% The Agreement of August 2003 to add an annex to the original WTO Agreement that allowed these countries to import generic drugs was thought to solve this problem . #% Finally , how would you assess the implications of the failure of the IGC on the proposal -- of which you have been very much in favour -- related to the creation of a European Foreign Minister to manage some of these issues ? #% · many of our members support the death penalty in certain circumstances and in any case regard the issue as a matter of conscience ( paragraphs 164-170 ) ; #% We therefore believe that it would be better to focus on this area , rather than extend an already over-complex code . #% That means that , no matter how high the standards of nuclear design and subsequent operation are , the quest for improvement should never stop ' . #% It is the nuclear industry -- not governments -- that needs to make provision in advance for decommissioning and ensure that the full cost is included in the balance sheet from the start . #% The gap can be filled with renewables only with great difficulty , whether solar , wind or biofuels . #% The countries of Europe have benefited from and been revitalized over the centuries by the waves of immigrants who have come in and stimulated the development of our societies . #% Mr President , the Commission is wrong in insisting on maintaining the word ` possibly ' , especially if we are offering it a menu of different options anyway . #% In the field of in-use compliance testing , the Commission has also been asked to produce proposals . #% Clearly , we want a dialogue in Kazakhstan between the government and the opposition ; we want them to respect international law . #% I will be pleased to see all six major greenhouse gases included . #% We have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the 21st century , its consumers , traders and citizens by voting for the committee ' s report or we can look at the future and then turn our back on it and find superficial comfort in the last century by voting for the amendments . #% Mr President , Taiwan is a prosperous , peaceful , democratic country which upholds high standards of human rights and the rule of law and threatens no-one . #% I feel sure that the results will demonstrate that the UK government ' s approach is not only inhumane , it is also uneconomical . #% The fact that 241 amendments were tabled gave rise to some concern in the Committee on Budgets . #% We also welcome recent action on war criminals and the action that the government , or at least some of it , has taken against corruption . #% I have to justify to my constituents the ethics of a report which originally sought to bind road rescue services and public utility vehicles - all absolutely essential to society - to strict new working hours . #% Any report such as this requires accurate information . #% That would enhance the role of Parliament , which already receives a quarterly report on the agency ' s activities and has the important task of giving discharge to the agency ' s director for the implementation of the budget . #% The British Conservatives support the use by the EU of certain civil instruments to help head off or alleviate crises in third countries . #% Other papers show the perfectly normal forward-planning of language training for the 2004-05 period but suddenly , in June 2004 , the teachers learned of their abrupt dismissal . #% One was the access to capital markets . #% I have seen the European Union Landfill Directive , which has had industrial waste - laughingly called ` compost ' - thrown upon the land . #% It is for this reason that we should not emasculate the proposal by removing pay from the scope of the directive or applying it only to workers in assignments of more than 12 months . #% The state of democracy and the rule of law in Russia remains of concern . #% I agree with Ms Oddy that this is voluntary in its nature . #% There was a difficult vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this particular report which in the end was a straight left/right divide . #% I have had the opportunity to visit China recently , at the invitation of the Chinese Government , to look at developments in the country that represents a fifth of the world 's population . #% Many of the recommendations are not implemented at all and many have to wait considerable periods of time . #% He should know that British beef has been banned from America for a number of years and that it is his government that is causing a problem for the beef industry by refusing to revalue the ` green pound ' . #% This blight could have appeared in any European country and could still hit at any time in the future . #% I was glad to hear the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development say that they would settle for the four-month advance that would involve coming forward from January 2002 . #% In the course of this debate , the Commission has been described as discourteous , our action improvised , dysfunctional and laggardly . #% This first reading is predominantly about the asterisk amendment concerning Kosovo , the Morocco fisheries agreement , East Timor and Turkey , which was mentioned by the rapporteur . #% They will vote for us to leave the European Union and begin the unravelling . #% This time , we are not obliged to do this because we ourselves have been prominently involved in the drafting of the reforms , both in the Convention and the IGC . #% It is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context ? #% If they reject what you are proposing , especially as far as the revision goes , the question remains : what will you do next ? #% There is one other key ingredient we should not miss out on and that is the principle of public accountability . #% However , some of the measures in this report encroach on areas better dealt with at Member State level . #% Finally , he is right to stipulate that team leadership , team working and team building are all critical to the effective operation of modern managerial skills . #% I suggest that Amendment No 8 , by the PSE Group and others , is split so that we have the first section from the start , ` welcomes the fact that the Commission has presented ... ' , down to the words ' ... in the Commission 's budget ' as the first split . #% I would like to see some financial incentives or rewards introduced to enable them to stop polluting water . #% The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries : there were two communications . #% Of course the background of the NATO military threat has been absolutely essential , as we in the Socialist Group have always insisted . #% Because we see the two groups as complementary , the committee majority chose to accord similar social rights to the two groups . #% That is totally unacceptable , and I therefore formally ask the Commission to initiate without delay an investigation into the situation in El Salvador and to consider a temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences . #% I would ask Commissioner Kovács to reiterate his support for this idea , which he expressed at a conference of the European Charities Committee on VAT here in Brussels two months ago . #% We have to surrender to the secret harmonies of comitology if we are going to leave it to Commission to advance the precise definitions . #% What is the way out ? #% We want some take-off from the Commission , not just cruising along . #% Eighteen months after they bombed hell out of Afghanistan , the heroin crop in that country is now greater than ever . #% We must do all we can to help . #% It is not often I get up to speak , so you will have to allow me some self-indulgence . #% I again commend these reports to the House and I apologise for the absence of Mrs Patrie , who was unable to attend because of other business . #% Events have shown that the answer really was that we do not know and it will be made up as we go along . #% 
Much-needed humanitarian supplies have been cut off after the disgraceful shooting down of two UN planes , whose personnel are still unaccounted for . #% This period has not been without its moments . #% Let me say , finally , I particularly welcome the fact that we have held these two debates today . #% We know , since this Parliament has discussed it on many occasions , that rape is used as a means to demoralise opponents by demonstrating the people can not even protect their own families . #% I do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind . #% Now our work on this proposal is presented as an attempt to force citizens to carry umbrellas . #% Nor does the common position include a reference to the modus vivendi which was agreed between the three institutions in 1995 . #% Iceland is a small , stable and wealthy democracy and a founder member of NATO and the Council of Europe . #% Mr President , I just wish out point out , so that Members are not in any way confused , that it is Amendment 1 -- the first vote on this report -- which ascertains whether or not Parliament is in favour of the theory of setting up a health scheme for former Members . #% It is unacceptable that when we are making such enormous scientific advances we still accept the infliction of pain on small animals in order to find out whether a new face cream is safe . #% If we fail to bring in such a softer procedure , it may never be possible to alter the political chapters . #% To outline priorities is fine and the priorities chosen are good ones - perhaps obvious ones , but nevertheless the right ones . #% I congratulate every one of my colleagues here who was involved in achieving that . #% At the stroke of a pen a new interfering busybody will be given a gigantic budget with which to expand their personal fiefdom and create another mountain of red tape . #% in writing . - When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission 's plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs , Greens were enthusiastic to help . #% One of them , the Pride of Kent is being fitted with the converter , the Eco-Silencer , and its sister ship the Pride of Canterbury is not being fitted , although it has been adapted for fitting at a later date . #% The overwhelming majority of you , with only one or two notable exceptions , were very much in favour of my report on early years learning and the other reports we debated today . #% This is in spite of a large American-led counter-insurgency force which operates in parallel to ISAF . #% We voted against to register our displeasure about this particular aspect and this is something that we will also need to fight a big battle on when it comes to the forthcoming Chemicals Directive . #% We should ask ourselves would we want to be receiving an injection from a doctor at the end of an 18-hour working day , which is not unusual . #% The EU 's Europe and partnership agreements are designed to encourage this further with due respect to the human rights and rights of minorities wherever they live . #% The purpose of confirmation hearings is to hear the candidates and to assess them objectively , not on nationality or on politics but on their views as potential members of the European Central Bank . #% I think we played a role in this Parliament in putting pressure on the Commission , so it , in turn , can talk to its negotiating partners about the need for greater transparency . #% We can dwell on that forever . #% The ten Member States that joined last year all had referendums in their countries . #% We have Euronews , an excellent independent channel , but like all public sector broadcasters , it needs funding . #% The money being spent belongs to the taxpayers of Europe , it is drawn from national governments , each of which has its own unique problems . #% The fact that the Champions League includes Russia , Turkey and Norway ? #% We have seen that the stress lies not with the reflection period - and it is right to scrap that - but with an unconditional right of withdrawal . #% For example , in my own city , the largest single cause of homelessness is domestic violence , namely violence against women and children in their homes . #% The money for the candidate countries up to 2006 represents one thousandth of the GDP of the EU and is 10 % of what Germany has spent on its own unification . #% It could be improved by some further amendment . #% Mr Haider said in 1992 of Professor Pelinka , after the latter had pointed out the Nazi past of Hans Steinecker , a precursor of the Freedom Party : `` The time is up for falsifiers of history and those who insult Austria . #% Mr President , the European Parliament has a strong record of condemning violations in Chile under the former military dictatorship of General Pinochet and of welcoming the return to civilian rule and the genuine progress which is being achieved in the observance of human rights in that country . #% The fact that the people of France and the Netherlands , two founding States , voted emphatically against the Constitution has to be of profound significance . #% The Parliament has made clear that registration for lobbyists who want to meet with MEPs will be mandatory from now on . #% On the contrary , it is very much a step in the right direction and , if our hopes are realised , it may prove to be one of the most significant measures this Union has ever taken , of real long-term advantage both to our economy and our environment . #% We would like to see more of you in the Internal Market Committee because we think that some of the proposals you have sent to us are not delivering benefits to consumers in the way that we would like to see . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , adoption is a positive way of providing a new family for children who can not be brought up by their birth parents , or children who lose their parents . #% That is the balance I suppose . #% I too did not support the Jürgen Schröder report , specifically because paragraphs 43 and 44 call into question the completion of the Temelin nuclear power plant and , in fact , contradict the earlier paragraph 42 which welcomes the Melk Accord between the Czech Republic , the Austrian government and the European Commission in December 2000 . #% If we do not , the European press will take each Member State in turn , they will look at the safety measures that are in those states and they will compare and then people ' s confidence in beef in general will collapse . #% I am glad that the EU is still trying to lead the world on the whole issue of climate change . #% I hope and pray the markets break you . #% It may have brought profits to a lot of people but to many others it has brought a great deal of pain . #% We have the opportunity to build on the already substantial achievements in the committee ' s final report . #% Therefore , we conclude that we must incorporate the Charter firmly within the Treaties , so that what is at present an important source of reference will become a central source . #% And further afield , indeed , there are babies available for adoption . #% It is absolutely essential that the other governments give the British Foreign Secretary a short , sharp shock at her first Summit and ignore her attempts to preserve secrecy in this unfair and unacceptable way . #% We must look at all the issues . #% It is a matter of great importance to one of my constituents , a lecturer at the Language Institute in Naples , who has been treated quite disgracefully in a Member State which is flagrantly disobeying and disregarding European employment law . #% For so long relegated to second class under the Tories , Britons are now first class citizens under Labour . #% Mr President , Commissioner Wallström always brings a light and happy touch to our proceedings and we are grateful for that . #% We should also ensure international compatibility - especially with the USA , the largest market . #% I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so . #% I applaud the resolve of countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary , which have been used to the tyranny of communism and have stood firm on any relaxation of the current arrangements . #% But then it would have to abandon its inflation target . #% I agree we should make the political point and we should also be asking for some of the other things that he is asking for , but I think there are a number of aspects here where he has exceeded his role as rapporteur for this committee and it has become rather a Christmas tree of some of his own ideas . #% But if we do not accept the proposition , the logic falls apart . #% This report , when he looks ahead , is an excellent report and provides useful guidelines for future action . #% It refers to where we are now . #% The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience , but rather a window through which we evolve our industry . #% But in particular , we need also to make sure that the airlines carrying them are aware of what they are carrying and the situation during the procedures . #% Belarus is a very poor country . #% We would have a totally different agricultural policy if the Agriculture Committee had codecision . #% We must also ensure that whatever solution is reached is practical and that we are prepared to give financial and other support to enable Lithuania and Poland to enforce it . #% 
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I welcome Mr Orbán . #% Parliamentary immunity is of course a matter for this Parliament , it is not for us as Members . #% I support a strong Russia with its recognised international borders , but say ` hands off Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova ' , and I call upon it to help solve the Transnistria question . #% At the very least we need very clear benchmarks , objectives and timetables for any voluntary agreements so that we can ensure that they are working . #% Mr Muis did not attend last night . #% Ultimately of course only the Greeks themselves can sort out the problems of the Greek public sector debt and we wish them well in their efforts to find their way out of the crisis . #% We must focus on that and indeed encourage the development of better academic and professional standards through exchanges and interrelations with academia in the European Union . #% Recital O of the report specifies that the Constitution should reflect the concept of the social model -- covering the same ground . #% It is in the power of the United Kingdom government , the German government and other national governments to remove that threat by complying with the habitats and birds directive . #% That takes time and money , Mrs Corbey . #% The first is one that Mr van Velzen has already touched on : the use of a communication in this matter . #% I believe every effort should continue to be made , because any deferment , any delay , would have a serious negative impact on public opinion in the acceding state and only encourage those interests most opposed to reform . #% I hope that the High Representative will insist on permanent observer status for the EU at the next ministerial meeting in April next year in Greenland . #% I would just say that some of the old public monopolies had their advantages and it would be disastrous if we ended up with new private monopolies with all the faults of the old public ones and none of the advantages . #% I am pleased that we reached an agreement and avoided a second reading and possible conciliation . #% If not , when will they come down ? #% Universities elsewhere may be overtaking us , but they owe their beginnings to European universities . #% We want adequate protection of new medicinal products . #% So I will leave those points to be made better by other people . #% Therefore , I believe it is vital that we bring that area of medicine out of the ghetto and into the mainstream and recognise the very real benefits it can bring . #% Indeed , the history of Israel-Jordan relations is as much a history of water relations as anything else . #% A great advantage of EU enlargement in the long run is the inclusion of a country such as , for example , Ukraine , whose aspirations to join the EU the Commission is , sadly , ignoring . #% Producers and consumers alike have everything to gain from a monitoring authority which protects the interests of all and is beholden to none . #% Mr President , at the Laeken Summit , the heads of government agreed to set up a constitutional Convention on the future of Europe which includes the possible incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , with its costly , social and economic rights , and the direct election of a European Commission President , which I oppose . #% So I hope no groups will take advantage of that deadline - if any have , I hope they will , even at this late stage , withdraw those amendments . #% If you put the words ` data retention ' in the title box you get 45 documents , but with no way of navigating what meeting they relate to . #% If there is an attempt at any stage to try and change that agreement or make it less rigorous , then this Parliament will roundly condemn it . #% May I remind the Council that the ICJ 's opinion articulates obligations incumbent on the whole of the international community to see that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end . #% Too many boats taking too few fish is the cry . #% Mr President , most people know that 1 May is International Workers ' Day , but I wonder how many people know that tomorrow , 28 April , is International Workers ' Memorial Day ? #% Can you give assurances that France is not just playing for time ? #% I thank Lisbon for giving us the Agenda , and the son of Lisbon on the Commission front bench for his leadership of that Agenda . #% The function of the mobile telephony market is to allow the maximum efficiency of the industry , while striking the right balance in consumer interests . #% Do not roam down the lanes of healthy eating or comparative diets , however important in health promotion work such routes may be . #% He was very sympathetic and expressed frustration at the lack of government action . #% The public post offices can make a profit and this is advantageous to the taxpayer but their prime aim is to perform this vital public service of postal communication universally for everyone , wherever they live , at an affordable price . #% Today 's proceedings , and I hope the vote tomorrow , are a victory for common sense . #% Compare that , for example , with Eastern Europe , where the figure was 30 % . #% I asked Commissioner Dimas one question : is the Natura network of sites complete , or is the Commission still taking Member States to court for failing to designate those sites ? #% It was my view that by voting against the Rothley report I could serve that political goal . #% Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights , twenty years after the Helsinki Final Act , ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and one year after the coming into force of the Amsterdam Treaty , there are constitutional provisions remaining in the heart of Europe which belong to the medieval age - provisions which have no place in a modern Europe . #% Specifically , it calls for the abandonment of the medical model , which regards disabled people as a problem , and instead recognises that disabled people have rights that should be enforced . #% On the EU code of conduct on the arms trade , is there yet a common list of military equipment covered by that code ? #% I should like to say on behalf of the Socialist Group and , I am sure , on behalf of this House , that we hope the Austrian Government will continue to press during the German presidency for the implementation of measures that will help to tackle unemployment . #% Secondly , the EU is dysfunctional in the area of justice , home affairs and human rights . #% The first decision was utterly deplorable . #% Recently , I questioned the fact that the ECB had decided to double its printing of EUR 500 banknotes this year -- the highest value banknotes in the world and the Russian mafia 's currency of choice , each one worth seven times a USD 100 bill . #% I thank the Commissioner for his answer , but unfortunately he did not address the particular point regarding the proposals to ameliorate the impact of abolition which he put to the public hearing that he earlier referred to earlier . #% But there was not sufficient management skill and management numbers in the Commission to carry these contracts through . #% If we are not very careful , we will find a mass of used packaging being exported from the European Union to China and elsewhere in order to escape this situation . #% I am quite sure we can carry on with this work and make sure that we have a good result in the end . #% I would like the Commission to bear in mind that at the time when Parliament put forward the amendments last April , the composition of this Parliament was indeed very different . #% Anything less than that and we would be betraying the generations which are looking to us for support and we must not let them down . #% At present in my country of Wales there seem to be more inspectors than sheep . #% That would arguably benefit developed world pharmaceutical companies and shift the emphasis from prevention to treatment . #% On GMOs it is clear that liability still has to be worked out , as legislation dealing with GMOs has only just come on to the statute books . #% We must seek to ensure that history is not repeated . #% By setting up a task force you have recognised that it is a serious problem across the Union . #% Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today . #% For the umpteenth time , the Petitions Committee has emphasised the need for the Commission 's infringement proceedings to be more robust and we welcome , therefore , the proposals made by Mrs Frassoni in this respect . #% The fact is that this type of technology can not be used with caution when you consider that , at a hundred miles from the ship which is the source of the noise , this noise can still cause a tearing of the tissues in the air sac , for example , behind whales ' and dolphins ' brains . #% Let us hear from you what practical actions you have taken and what you have achieved over the past twelve months to contribute towards the aims of that resolution . #% We are treating it as if it were new . #% We know the issues surrounding this area of media and communication will only increase and continue to haunt us . #% Nearly 20 % of the budget is not spent correctly , as we would like it to be . #% Mr President , I would like to add my voice to those expressing their concern about those beyond the immediate farms who are being affected by this crisis . #% 
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which , in seeking to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative . #% I urge you to help in this case . #% We do not need a tsunami warning centre in Asia . #% There have been attacks on opposition figures , that is true , but the authorities to their credit have arrested eight suspects , in spite of them being part of the ruling party coalition , and two radical Islamist groups have recently been banned . #% I hope we will look at that soon . #% Parliament will be keenly awaiting the agreed studies and will equally keenly want a positive approach from the Council and the Commission to reforms of the Treaty , notably Article 129 , to continue the progress that this represents . #% We have also been campaigning for a suitable framework to cover bonds . #% I have two specific questions , Commissioner . #% Finally , there needs to be an adequate review procedure to ensure that these criteria are applied in the execution of the contract . #% Interesting times , and an interesting side-effect to our report . #% Nevertheless , we intend to ensure that future money will be allocated to British redundant workers and , if we find that they are not eligible , we shall vote against all future mobilisations of the fund . #% Mr President , on behalf of our Group I should like to warmly welcome Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi ' s excellent report . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Harrison on his excellent , pragmatic report on late payments . #% There are also allegations that there have been numerous paper or technical candidates submitted by backers of Mr Yanukovych in order to distort the composition of the local election committees . #% These materials have been in widespread use around the world for forty years , yet there is no evidence of any kind that any damage has ever been done to anyone . #% I thus support this regulation to improve the safety of European citizens in their places of work and at home , whether they be carrying out projects independently or professionally . #% I would like to echo that call for both colleagues across the European Parliament and governments across Europe to reach an agreement on this directive as soon as possible . #% Only 1 in 10 000 people in Africa is a scientist or engineer , whereas the figure is 1 in 200 in industrial nations . #% It envisages a political process to put the country back into the hands of the Iraqis with the involvement of a UN special coordinator . #% In the ` passerelle ' clause , will the blocking of a single parliament be able to paralyse it ? #% There again we have had half-hearted sanctions by the EU going through the motions of taking action , but in effect allowing the regime off the hook because of the self-interested agenda of one or two of our Member States . #% Even as recently as last week , a Sudanese Government Antonov plane was bombing villages in north Darfur . #% If you persist with a closed shop of 27 EU countries when there is a whole world out there just waiting to engage in trade with Europe , then the problems of your own making will continue . #% He is now coming to Cardiff to say farewell to heads of state - and to savour the delights of the capital city of Wales ! #% As a gesture of goodwill I will be accepting five small amendments from the EPP , though incidentally none of those mentioned by Mr Evans . #% It is as if Charles Clarke 's frenzy of activity on this topic was a mirage . #% If we are looking at figures , then if we were to take this Parliament as an example , we would be looking at a group roughly the size of the Liberal Democrat group as the percentage of those suffering harassment . #% Anger was defused because it was agreed that one polling station in each community could stay open until complaints were investigated . #% But subsequently , in cases before the Court of Justice , it is now being further elaborated into a means whereby trademark owners can actually protect their brand , or supposedly protect their brand and their authorised distribution systems , by essentially keeping prices higher artificially . #% And now we have got the licensing of authorised economic operators , which hugely benefits those who qualify and undermines everyone else with extra costs and bureaucracy . #% Well , we have our two pygmies . #% This has been a difficult and complex task and the three rapporteurs have certainly done a very good job in the circumstances . #% In the vast majority of modern occupational settings there will be no risk . #% We want to see and allow free trade in these substances but , at the same time , maintain a high level of protection for human health and the environment . #% Mr President , I would not disagree at all that this is a sensitive issue . #% However , that still leaves us with the problems facing industry if other amendments also pass . #% Regular collection and dissemination of data on the use of pesticides should help increase awareness and control of pesticide use , and play a small but significant role in ensuring that pesticides are safe both to human health and the environment , whilst avoiding the concerns expressed about the previous package . #% Looking ahead , we must ensure that the rules are properly implemented , that transport as meat increasingly becomes the norm , and that the rules are driven more by science than by emotion . #% I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has taken up my suggestion that we should have an own-initiative report looking precisely at these issues . #% Continual industrial restructuring is vital for a healthy economy , for the replacement of yesterday 's unwanted jobs with the fresh jobs needed for the future . #% The margins for the years to come , which the Commission has promised to respect , would be further reduced if budgetary neutrality were not common to all institutions . #% Although the political guidelines proposed by the Commission for negotiating the new cooperation agreements with the ACP provide a starting point for discussions on the renewal of our relationship , in too many areas I am afraid they are not much more than that . #% Similarly , on the wider definition of institutions and the bodies and agencies , the Commission is mandated by Recital 8 and by the joint statement to review the rules of agencies and , where necessary to propose amendments as soon as possible . #% Will he use that successful experience as a means of persuading the different Commissioners and the different directorate-generals to work together to develop a common purpose and common strategies , using their common resources to combat both social exclusion and long-term unemployment ? #% However , we are opposed to the Code becoming legally binding . #% Mr President , can I just object to the fact that the Thorning-Schmidt report and the Ghilardotti report are going to be voted on immediately after the debate ? #% I asked for roll-call votes to make sure . #% Secondly , municipal elections will be held , probably in November but maybe next year . #% We are talking about coaches , perhaps travelling at 90 kilometres per hour on motorways . #% It sets out how Israel 's policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development . #% We must find a way to stop that . #% Secondly , there is a role for foreign direct investment . #% Finally , this meeting could have resulted in a far-reaching action plan of concrete actions . #% Were this not bad enough , even more suffering is now being planned by the European Union under the REACH Directive , and we will see millions more animals moved around for live testing . #% We , in the Liberal Group , welcome the thrust of the report , because it grapples with the real issues and it avoids the sort of populist solutions which , I am afraid , are on offer in many of the amendments before this House . #% We should be flexible in reflecting developments on how that charge is measured . #% We need these countries to work together with us to stop multinational crime . #% This age requires sound infrastructure , sound technical capacity , knowledge and content . #% At the same time , though , a full liberalisation of the sugar market would have an adverse effect , not only on the European sugar industry but also on the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries and less-developed countries . #% - The British Conservative Members decided to abstain in our vote on this report . #% We also all agree that education is rightly a matter for the individual Member States and the regions . #% Could somebody clarify that he has actually said this please , Mr President , because it is a change of views . #% I do that in the full knowledge that these are made in my own constituency . #% Will it just be a question of how a common fisheries policy should change for the future , or will they actually consider the broad spectrum of alternatives which might go from complete renationalization - not something that I would advocate - but through regionalization and into a completely unified European fleet . #% I am sure many of us know somebody who has suffered from , or has , multiple sclerosis , and I take Mr Howitt 's last point . #% What sort of period would he like to see before an application for EU membership came from Montenegro ? #% 
May I turn specifically to some of the amendments . #% This means immediately releasing all political prisoners , especially Xanana Gusmão in East Timor , and recognizing the right of the East Timorese people to self-determination . #% Mr President , the single currency - the euro - will , of course , save a great deal of money : most European Union countries will not require agri-compensation payments after 1 January . #% Socialism does not do that . #% They imagine -- or believe -- that they will be supported and that the airlines will give them assistance . #% In Eritrea there has been little response to the démarche so far : forced military conscription , arbitrary detention , harassment of refugees and the use of torture continue . #% It will enable us to work with other countries beyond the European Union to prevent , control and defeat the health threats that we face today . #% Equally , we need to make sure that the system is not abused . #% Why should we who are charged with representing the peoples of Europe pass a law to prevent firms from giving good deals to their customers ? #% Finally , I will warmly welcome contributions from the outset from all parliamentary committees to establish the sectoral priorities for this budget . #% It covers such things as aircraft , ships and buildings . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament over the next six months to ensure that we have proper accountability of the European Central Bank and to ensure that the aims and objectives of economic and monetary union will promote the objective of employment within the European Union . #% Secondly , looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening , paragraph 28 is of particular importance . #% If there are no fish , there are no stocks and nobody will be able to fish . #% But if it were members of my family who were separated and somewhere else in the world - whatever the relationship or their situation - I would welcome this and would hope that we could have family reunification that would draw us together . #% The Commissioner mentioned the communication , which clearly is not now going to be on the table in time for the ICO and world high-level round-table meeting in London . #% At the WTO in particular , there is enormous scope for the EU and ACP working more closely together . #% The first pointer is that it is quite clear that technology runs ahead of politicians . #% We will then bring forward effective and well-understood regulation that is easy to implement at our borders . #% It would be very unfortunate if the European Parliament were to appear to be less liberal than the Commission , bearing in mind that we are talking of a very high technology , fast-moving area where Europe is in very grave danger of falling further and further behind the United States . #% I want Member States here to be required to do all that they can realistically to meet the targets , no more and no less . #% We have built that up ourselves . #% With someone so practical in his approach to life , I am sure we can also look forward to a very practical Presidency . #% That is too prescriptive . #% Can I now ask you , Madam President , to write a formal invitation to the Czech Presidency , as well as the incoming Swedish Presidency , to open a formal dialogue with the European Parliament as soon as possible ? #% A diplomat from the German Embassy in Estonia , Mr Carsten Wilms , made a speech in favour of accession . #% With regard to health and safety at work , I would also like to see an amendment to the 2000 biological agents directive , to protect health workers from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from needle-stick injuries . #% We have heard enough from the political classes of Europe . #% If you look around Member States , for example the United Kingdom , we can see that a genuine lead has been taken to recognise the undoubted potential benefits of these technologies but also that there is the need for controls and proper licensing arrangements which reflect the very real ethical concerns . #% It may also be that this is not possible and it has to be broken up . #% However , what a directive can do is to change the perception individuals have of nuclear energy and their judgment as to whether or not it is safe . #% How can we speak derogatorily of the 1 000 Iraqi Kurds in the `` East Sea '' as illegal economic migrants , when NATO members , including my own Member State , are sufficiently conscious of their vulnerability to Saddam Hussein 's persecution , as demonstrated in the past , to enforce a no-fly zone in northern Iraq ? #% We must also recognise that there is still considerable abuse by the armed forces against those who wish to express a desire for autonomy in parts of Indonesia . #% The rules of origin requirements are far too strict , with the result that a large proportion of developing-country exports to the EU fail to gain preferential access because they are deemed to be non-originating . #% President , our spokesman will be speaking for our Group later , but I also have a few comments to make at this stage . #% Your colleague Martin Bartenstein , who I have got to know very well over the last six months , was quoted in the in December saying that it would be a miracle if you achieved agreement on the Services Directive during your Presidency . #% Every time I come here I have to smile . #% If you want our citizens to relate to the EU , I give you a cause worth championing . #% Whilst we should prefer such laws to be the laws of each member country rather than of an EU superstate , there must be laws covering such matters . #% Secondly , mandatory targets in the first instance are too restrictive . #% We know from our own experience in this Parliament that there is not always that necessary coherence between our objectives . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the reference Mr Cook made to the need for economic reform . #% These things are in need of quick action . #% Therefore I urge the Commissioner on his visit to Egypt to raise at the highest level with President Mubarak the case of Dr Ibrahim and his colleagues . #% The essential point at every stage of the EPA negotiating process is to ensure that the outcome works in favour of development . #% As a member of the Committee on Budgets for almost ten years I would challenge any Member - except Mr Samland and Mr Colom I Naval - to explain the formula for VAT and GNP-based own resources , that is to say how to calculate Member States contributions . #% The story of international aid to these countries is sadly one of waste , embezzlement and corruption . #% I should like to answer very quickly the other questions , starting with Mr Lund . #% The problem is that the poultry meat can not be tested for growth promoters or , if it is , some time may have elapsed and the meat can no longer be tested for it . #% I have to say that I have received no representations from allergy sufferers on this point . #% I warn anyone who thinks that he can play fast and loose with this kind of report that the gloves will come off . #% That is why the issue of employment , which was discussed at the informal summit meeting , must be a critical point in the discussions in Vienna . #% In fact , is there a future for this project or should we now be rethinking the whole initiative ? #% I am very grateful to the many colleagues who supported my report . #% You said in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs . #% In other words , political stability in some regions is bringing recovery and the hunger elsewhere is caused partly by fighting , although only sporadically , but much more by the drought . #% In that connection , more work needs to be done on Mr Zappalà 's report . #% Mostly they were concerned with issues such as sex tourism and general abuse in countries all over the world . #% Organs are for another day . #% Of course we all want to see improved relations with China , but not at the expense of our own security . #% Consider , too , the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP . #% Mr President , I welcome the fact that enlargement is proceeding relatively smoothly . #% Should we not respond to the calls that have been made repeatedly by Aung San Suu Kyi for political and economic isolation of the SPDC . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the Commission has created a huge crisis in the egg industry . #% I have seen it . #% The whole subject needs to be treated with care , and I know the Commissioner will ensure that this is the case as we move forward to take on good practice throughout the European Union . #% 
Only yesterday Mr Schulz complained that the elected MEPs in this House did not have as much say as the Council and the unelected Commission . #% Labour MEPs have been campaigning for two years to introduce these measures which represent a genuine triumph for European consumers and could not have been achieved without the EU . #% Following the Commission 's decision on Charleroi , we feel this principle should be upheld in respect of the TENs and in particular the motorways of the sea element of the programme . #% Liberalisation and the pursuit of free-trade policies will lead to a more competitive and dynamic economy in Europe . #% We must continue to enforce a no-fly zone , including giving the pilots the right to self-defence . #% That was a real illustration of the EU delivering the increased security from crime and terrorism our citizens want . #% Mr President , perhaps the most surprising thing about this is that in the committee vote it was only passed by 36 to 1 . #% This will result in a dramatic reduction in rescue time and make it possible to treat more injuries in the crucial ` golden hour ' following the accident . #% This is not clever , what we need is a resolution of this problem and that means an early negotiation of a framework . #% Finally , I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg . #% I was particularly pleased that he raised and played back to us a number of items from our resolution of 19 June . #% The cost of all this , despite our best efforts , is unknown . #% An IGC that failed to grant the citizen improved access to the European Court means a charter will be more of a public relations exercise than a powerful re-definition of European citizenship . #% Through what we have voted , this will also apply to Rule 29 in its new version , which lays down the minimum size for constituting a political group in Parliament . #% The report , as many speakers have said , is judicious and balanced . #% Most of all , how can we guarantee the system of prior notification for high-risk products at ports that have the necessary facilities to deal with them ? #% It is a shame that Conservative MEPs sided with the mobile phone industry to oppose consumer protection , making the case for higher charges to be levied . #% Secondly , we are now moving towards having an efficient and transparent agency system as reported in the budget . #% It is long enough - I would have liked it to have been shorter , but let us hope the governments , and the British Government in particular , adhere to that . #% The mandate given under Rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure was , and I quote , `` to table amendments seeking to reach a compromise '' , in order to adopt the Regulation in a single reading and within the date set in the Treaty to implement Article 255 . #% . Mr President , I shall start by expressing my thanks and paying tribute to colleagues across this House who regularly attend the ACP meetings and contribute so much to it . #% We must have the framework first and then look at how it is best implemented and whether such harmonisation is appropriate . #% It is also hotly opposed by the Consumers Association . #% That is a very reasonable compromise . #% Only then will the market in beef and veal fully recover , and our farmers will again have an assured income . #% It is clear , unfortunately , that China 's competitiveness is built , at least in part , on its exploitation of its workers and on its externalisation of social and environmental costs . #% It is right that we concentrate much effort on our relationship with Russia , and there is much that can be done there . #% But what we have to deal with is how to prevent the transmission . #% That just can not be good enough for Parliament or for Europe . #% That would be the true road map for women . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome the initiative by the British Presidency to establish a new code of conduct for the arms trade . #% However , we support the Commission in its legislative resolution and want the Council to come to an agreement as soon as it possibly can . #% Mention has been made of the fears of some Member States . #% The European single market allows borders to be crossed , but we must do all we can to prevent such exploitation of our borders . #% People who do so do not help Hong Kong . #% Madam President , for the Committee on Foreign Affairs there are two key issues in this discharge : transparency and implementation . #% Commissioner , we have the support of insurers , the support of legal practitioners , the support of victims , the support of those we represent , but somehow we can not transmit these concerns to the Commission or to the Council . #% There is growing demand for specialized services and there are clear environmental benefits to encourage the maritime sector . #% If we can iron out one or two little problems that still remain in his report , then we should be able to get a large majority to support it . #% Depending on the eye of the beholder a bath of hot water may be half-full or half-empty ; I compare the changes proposed by the rapporteur , with cross-party support , as representing very much the half-full option . #% It delivers prosperity , choice and the conditions required for democracy and civilised values . #% It is particularly important that you look at this , Commissioner . #% Do they have to go through the national offices of the Commission ? #% I understand all the hard work that has been put into it , but let us say straight away that many people have been involved , inside and outside this Chamber , perhaps more than we know . #% One fact is certain : without good governance in Africa , increased aid will be of only marginal value . #% These are all questions that as a committee we seek answers to . #% The public right across the Union no longer supports the currency , and the battle for Spain has not even begun . #% Can we trust the Commission on that ? #% I would agree with some of the remarks made by Mrs Schörling . #% Who can own land in the Ivory Coast ? #% In my view , retrospective laws are often extremely bad laws - they are grossly unfair to existing users and industries which have grown up under an existing regulatory framework . #% Mr President , I also would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco for an excellent report . #% We welcomed the conclusions from the Lisbon Summit last year : the move towards flexibility , the move towards entrepreneurship , towards innovation that were reflected there . #% Every time Mr Blair and Mr Brown say that it is a matter of economics whether the UK joins or not , they are deceiving the British public or they are deeply deluded about the future of Europe . #% Flooding in the Low Countries of Europe is not permitted to get out of hand : the Dutch Government has made great efforts to fight back . #% Where is the application and the resolve to achieve some real results ? #% However , may I draw his attention to the Daphne-funded analyses , recently conducted surveys focusing particularly on long-term institutional care , averaging 13 months , of children under three years of age , which is the time when they are most likely to be damaged neurologically . #% These are challenges that go right to the heart of the reform process and challenges that concern my own committee . #% Those who sometimes worry that in seeking such guarantees Parliament is trying to modify the interinstitutional equilibrium should remember that this substantial delegation of powers is itself a modification of the interinstitutional equilibrium as it exists and that in those circumstances it is quite legitimate for Parliament to seek to obtain certain guarantees . #% Could the Commissioner tell me if what he said adds up to a guarantee that there will be a better balance between commitments and payments in Asia and Latin America and that we will have better utilisation of the funds voted for in the budget ? #% It is no good banning something if you are unsure about what will replace it . #% In fact some people responsible for saw mills say that it is the worst situation they have experienced in 45 years in the industry . #% Europe is the proud home of the international capital market and this deal now gives that international market a way of bringing its benefits across to domestic investors too . #% The important proposal of mutual recognition is also absolutely essential to making everything work successfully . #% What value is there in diminishing the lives of ordinary human beings ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Damanaki for her recent proposal to end the appalling practice of discarding . #% 
Had the report not insisted on every one of these reforms being a precondition that has to enter into force before any further enlargement , it would no doubt have gained a larger majority . #% If local fishermen have proper ownership of these waters , the conservation measures will work . #% Meanwhile we should tackle the lack of democracy in the oil-rich states . #% All of these are good and positive things . #% But the fact that they were prepared to vote for protection of `` strict legal requirements '' met by European farmers , but against the destructive dumping of agricultural goods by us in Europe against peasant farmers in developing countries is scandalous . #% I congratulate Mrs Weisgerber . #% If you are not a card-carrying Zanu-PF member then you are subject to harassment , discrimination , assault , selective starvation policies and murder . #% However , the whole report as it stood is still unacceptable . #% There is no natural light at all and we demand huge amounts of electricity . #% As we have a particular interest it may be that , by maintaining that contact , we can support the process in a very constructive way . #% All it will mean in the end is that a country having trouble sticking to the rules of the pact does not have to . #% We need to see Parliament and the Council working closer together . #% Mr President , I wish to make an oral amendment to Amendment 19 . #% I would also echo the concern of the rapporteur on the issue of comitology . #% As a mere backbencher , if I get one minute -- determined by officials and not by knowledge or need -- I am lucky . #% We were prepared to support the Commission proposal if it did not contain these amendments ( 9 or 39 ) but abstain if they were included . #% Those public rules are often a marked improvement on the practice in a number of our Member States . #% He has done an excellent job and it is a very good report . #% The first of these is shared management : the problems about which we heard from the President of the Court of Auditors in the Budgetary Control Committee yesterday evening , when , much to my surprise and that of other colleagues , he said he was not particularly interested in shared management because the Council pays and it is the Commission that takes responsibility for signing off the budget . #% Since Mr Sasi has kindly agreed to come to the meeting of the European Parliament ' s Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy on 12 October , I suggest he presents his formal response to both these points at that meeting . #% We therefore welcome the new direction which has been developed by President Barroso . #% In particular it has missed a rare opportunity to alter the political priorities and instead has continued to fund the traditional spending programmes . #% I also welcome the fact that we will be supporting civil society ' s objectives in these next few weeks . #% We have secured a great prize and we must build on it . #% When the conflict in Iraq is over , North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise the transatlantic alliance before it is too late . #% Can we please avoid such distasteful displays in the future , or at least see that the interests of victims and their families are given due respect ? #% Europe must introduce stronger measures to tackle this disturbing subject and ensure that offenders are punished in a similar way across the European Union . #% Clearly , with new technology and globalisation , child pornography on the Internet , in particular , is an ever-growing international problem . #% Yet as someone who follows the country closely , it is a complaint I have never heard . #% Enforcement of regulation must be something that you will look at . #% Finally , I deplore the attacks on Mr Alvaro ; he delivered a resounding near-consensus in Committee . #% I also fully support the paragraphs in the motion calling for the Syrian authorities to ensure that detainees are not tortured in prison . #% The principal recommendation here is for a further study of the consequences of a transition to the use of the principle of international exhaustion . #% today reported scientist James Lovelock saying that , frankly , it is too late already . #% If it does not , the least we should do -- and I mean the least we should do -- is maintain our EU embargo on trade in arms . #% Should this be the case , this seems to be against the letter and the spirit of both EU law and convention , in that many of these nationals are outside of their home territory for perfectly legitimate reasons . #% I hope this legislation will be implemented without delay so that this disgraceful practice can be stopped as soon as possible . #% Can I also make it absolutely clear that Amendment No 11 is also a compromise text and that is shown at the bottom of your voting list . #% He also said that the IGC will ` take into account ' . #% Would it not have been a magnificent gesture and morally right to have offered to airlift out all the local victims of the Bali bomb , to show that we were not just looking after rich white westerners ? #% The decision regarding multiple sites was of course taken by Member State governments and my purpose here is simply to indicate the consequences of such actions . #% I therefore appeal to the sponsors of these amendments to consider withdrawing them . #% If we get those things clarified I think we can get the solution the Council is looking for . #% Second , in the light of last week 's unanimous vote in the UN and 's revelation that the US has agreed to allow a joint UN Development Programme/World Bank agency to administer the funds , it is now easier for us in Europe to think of allocating more funds for Iraq 's reconstruction . #% Mr President , I would like to speak in favour of this request . #% It would prefer its own little Marxist state , living in the past . #% This may not sound much to those of us who have been working on the report since March , but to the already overburdened managers of companies in the freight transport system all over Europe it would prove a great help in making applications for assistance for projects much easier . #% So far as empowering managers is concerned , the best instance we can give is that from May 1 we inaugurated the new internal audit service , the central financial service and we will shortly be having the first meeting of the Audit Progress Committee . #% Finally , I have made a few comments about the European Investment Bank taking a controlling interest in the EIF . #% Its merits are spoilt , however , by paragraph 8 . #% What are we to tell our constituents who ask for research before reassurance , wherever it leads ? #% Now she has been allowed to answer precisely two questions in three months ! #% Indeed , when Commissioner Byrne spoke in front of the House , he congratulated the UK Government on its swift , direct handling of this issue . #% In the work of our committee on citizens ' rights and freedom , the challenge must be to ensure that despite deep-rooted changes we are still able to maintain the rights of over 400 million EU citizens to freedom of movement , a decent education and a decent home . #% There was a stronger report from the Court of Auditors for the year 1994 . #% We have an increased administrative and bureaucratic burden , which still leaves different firms facing over 15 different legal systems and rule systems . #% We need to develop environmentally friendly technologies , partly because of the employment opportunities they create and the training needs that exist , but also because of their positive social repercussions . #% Britain is far from rich as it is . #% I commend both the amendments and the report to you . #% Given these conflicting aspects of the Commission proposed by Mr Barroso , we have , with regret , decided that we have no alternative but to abstain . #% I hope transport ministers will be persuaded to agree to it , otherwise this whole package might be rejected . #% I very much support his desire to legislate so as to see Europe meet the technological challenges in this sector and maintain a leading position in the world . #% On the other hand , we talk a lot of rhetoric about human rights , we preach to third countries , but there are credible indications of complicity by many EU countries in illegal rendition and torture . #% I say that we have a quarrel with those who abuse Islam and who turn the principles of Islam into weapons against the innocent . #% Only through a united and coordinated approach will the EU 's diplomacy eventually succeed . #% As we steer our way out of the crisis , we must look to European solutions that promise to build a stronger European economy and better-integrated financial systems that benefit the people of Wales and the whole European Union . #% 
I am delighted that there has been no question of the Luxembourg presidency being intimidated by noises off from certain great figures in European politics about the problems with that directive , of how they have sorted it out , and of how they have killed the directive in some cases . #% Madam President , I too would like to extend my thanks to the rapporteur for what was an extremely difficult job . #% The EU has just pledged EUR 1.5 bn in aid to Afghanistan over five years at the Tokyo Conference . #% I first met her in the late 1980s . #% I am sorry but , for the real world of industrial technology , your blunderbuss amendments are simply not good enough . #% She , above everyone , knows the heartache that this disaster has caused and I pay tribute to her tireless efforts on behalf of the people of Galicia . #% We had 50 000 sheep on the move , largely untraced , when the virus struck . #% Nevertheless , for single products , it is clear that their agricultural origin should be available to consumers and this is 100 % feasible . #% Is it not the case that those same companies benefit from access to the single market and from the European Union whilst foisting charges upon EU citizens ? #% Probably the biggest benefit of the European Police College will be policemen getting to know each other and working together for the first time . #% And if we involve ourselves in removing the imperative to export military material then we may force the incoming Bush administration to reconsider its apparent blind commitment to national missile defence with the threat to world peace and stability that poses . #% There will now be greater cross-border police cooperation , including - at Britain ' s suggestion - a new Police Chiefs ' Task Force and a European police college . #% It is ahead of its time because the extension of patent regimes to cover drugs in India and other countries in 2005 has not yet bitten . #% I urge the Commission to carry on its good work on TB , AIDS and malaria and to renew its efforts in the neglected diseases , because they are also killing and debilitating people across the developing world . #% The cage is factory farming at its very worst . #% The common position that we received from the Council was a major advance over the first reading text and I would like to thank the Council and Commission for accepting so many of Parliament 's ideas and suggestions . #% I hope that these amendments will be taken more seriously by the Commission than some of the amendments that the Commissioner referred to , which call for even stricter levels that may not be cost-effective . #% Our vote accordingly urges the Commission to bring forward proposals to this effect . #% I will be supporting my electorate , who are large sugar producers , and I will not be supporting the multinationals who are lobbying very hard . #% I will address my final remarks to the Commissioner , even though she will probably never speak to me again . #% Much of the rest of the region has also benefited . #% However , the nuclear crisis is still hanging over us . #% That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see . #% It is 20 years since the Soviet Union collapsed , but for President Lukashenko of Belarus , it is as if nothing has changed at all . #% The Court of Auditors quite properly has raised the matter of the appalling contract which was agreed between the Council and the Greek state on the provision of a new building . #% Mr President , the Council should realise that it is heading for a great row if it carries on as in its complex package of 27 December , making legal definitions of who is a terrorist without any democratic scrutiny . #% We know the proposal is not absolutely perfect but the general feedback , both at a recent hearing in committee and from those who have lobbied Members has been : ` let ' s have what might be an imperfect directive with a review rather than none at all ' . #% How can we run a competitive European economy when we saddle a major industry with those sorts of compliance costs ? #% We have shown that we are prepared to do that . #% I agree with him that there are a large number of NGOs doing sterling work . #% It is to encourage and support continued progress , with respect for human rights and democratisation , and to raise concerns where abuses occur or where the situation is evidently deteriorating . #% Mr President , when I hear the litany of crises and problems that confront us , I am alarmed that so many think that the answer to these problems is more European Union . #% This is an area that we need to revisit at a future time and examine the particular circumstances that exist in the new Member States when they enter the Union . #% Therefore I call on the Commission to act in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties and the fundamental rights enshrined in those Treaties . #% Of course , it is unacceptable to destroy the livelihoods of thousands of tobacco farmers without assistance with restructuring . #% Without the Constitution , the Union will fail to have the capacity to act to fulfil the Commission 's ambitions for it . #% Adoption by the duma of the budget proposed by the government for the year 2000 will be a significant test . #% We have no Objective 1 funding . #% Secondly , that the deal on applying Lamfalussy committees to the securities market was a strictly temporary measure , which is why there are four-year ` sunset clauses ' agreed by the Council in both the prospectus and the market abuse directives . #% In my view this is at least as important as many of the conclusions reached by parliamentarians ' meetings such as ASEP II . #% The Commission in future must show that it means business to ensure that sport , like other businesses across Europe , must observe European rules and regulations . #% Romania before Communism and Fascism was one of great prosperity , with the Anglo-Romanian oil company and significant investment from France . #% However , if we are to deliver the Lisbon Agenda , it is not good enough simply to say that the guidelines will not change before 2006 . #% Could you confirm that there will be no exceptions whatsoever to that and that under no circumstances can decommissioning funds be used for commercial purposes ? #% What more can Europe do ? #% I have campaigned on disability and age for many years , but I was convinced quite some time ago that we could not leave anybody behind . #% The ` producer must pay for disposal principle ' is a part of the EU mindset . #% Let us not lose sight of what is in this budget . #% The invitation which invites us to celebrate the inauguration of the new President of the European Parliament comes in the name of Mr Luigi Mormino , chairman of the artistic committee of the European Parliament . #% I support measures to prevent a similar outbreak of foot and mouth disease , as proposed in the report . #% Let us keep Question Time . #% On this basis , producers and eventually their customers , are being asked to sign a blank cheque . #% Mr President , it is no coincidence that my colleague , Mr Bushill-Matthews , and myself have asked to speak in this debate . #% I gather that we are now going to consult on smiling faces : if we end up with the happy , smiling face of Mrs Wällstrom looking down on Brighton beach , I am sure that will be a boon to mankind , but it must stand alongside the blue flag . #% However , there are some aspects in the report which need clarifying . #% It seems to me that this one example demonstrates why it is crucial that care is taken with regard to the EU 's fishing agreements , ensuring that the Union is helping to improve governance in third-country waters , but also addressing the urgent need on all sides to step up the quality of monitoring and enforcement . #% Mr President , I came to this opinion on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee with many misgivings . #% Dotcom benefactors make up India 's rich list , cashing in as India becomes the global hub for ITC development . #% We ought to investigate this . #% Mr President , this debate on my report is most timely , coming as it does only two days ahead of the first formal Justice and Home Affairs Council under the Swedish Presidency . #% I am sure colleagues will agree he has been one of the best and most accessible of all the Commissioners . #% I agree absolutely with everything the Commission has said . #% It is not long before the new waters around these islands are fished out . #% We similarly propose to give the Commission the right to maintain an implementing measure , provisionally , when Parliament has objected to it , pending a full legislative procedure to review , amend or repeal the implementing measure - again an element of flexibility that I expect the Commission to welcome . #% We want to get back to a report about the social dimension , not just the Socialist dimension . #% So we believe this is the right package , but I commend the way that Bill Miller has sought to tighten up some aspects , particularly those relating to Commission officials who may take the retirement package and then go on to take up other jobs . #% 
In other words , when can I get my first document out of the Council ? #% Pope Benedict is entitled to his views as his own human right , whether or not others agree with them . #% On a minor point , Mrs Harkin mentioned agriculture . #% Therefore if we are genuinely interested in the competitiveness and good functioning of Europe 's economy , we have to proceed with this directive . #% Half a million people were genocidally slaughtered by this method . #% It should surprise no one that the Chinese Communist Party prevents him or his family representative from collecting the award . #% That would give a clear signal about the direction he wants to go . #% Tell British truckers and businesses , because they will bear the cost . #% But , with the free trade agreement in place , products arriving from the EU into South Africa duty-free will also enter the other customs union countries duty-free - there are no tariff barriers between them . #% The failure to act , President Van Rompuy , President Barroso , is feeding ammunition to Mr Farage and his allies . #% What I would like to know is : in what way does the detention of persons without charge , the refusal to provide meaningful information for the reasons for detention and the removal of a lawyer 's right to take meaningful instructions in such matters either reaffirm these values or assert their validity ? #% Will the President-in-Office say where the substance is in this proposal ? #% No fault to you , Commissioner , but please go back to the College and say we need to debate with the Commissioners responsible for the briefs in question . #% The British Delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support . #% If there is evidence , it will be presented , and we rely upon you to take action where it is necessary . #% We must not allow this terrible slaughter of 10 million animals to happen again . #% So we should really be welcoming that agreement , particularly as it established the general principles governing any agreement to be signed , including the point made by colleagues that no agreement should be signed if it means that people will enjoy impunity . #% I should like to point out that the costs to the individual Members of Parliament who took that legal action was , surprise , surprise , in the order of # 1000 each , something rather more than the fine that has now been imposed upon the World Cup organisers . #% Finally , to take account of a problem on pre-accession assistance which arose from the Council 's reading , and which we were not able to pick up quickly enough , we ask the Commission at the end of paragraph 25 of the resolution , ` to present a transfer request or amending budget during the course of 2007 if the amounts foreseen in the 2007 budget turn out to be insufficient ' . #% How many people in this Parliament can really say that they understand the procedures that have now been set up within the Commission to improve the quality of legislation ? #% So we can not exclude one country because we do not like it very much : we have to open our doors to as many countries as we can and encourage the work that is being done . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement . #% So there is an urgent need for us to seize our opportunity for renewal . #% The threat of a trend towards a non-permanent workforce will lead to a lack of job security , lower skills levels , lower wages , a deterioration in working conditions , and will have a detrimental impact on the surrounding communities . #% One of the justifications for strict rules of origin is that they should promote so-called backward linkages , i.e. the production of intermediate goods in developing countries themselves . #% The prevarication , the delays , of course are indefensible as both Commissioners have said . #% Mr President , the fact that the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a political priority for the European Union is shown by the speedy progress of this measure . #% It is intended as a first step towards establishing an accounting regime across Europe which meets the requirement of a modern global market place and which , in particular , will provide those who read company accounts with the kind of information they will want and should be entitled to know . #% Then we can all continue to enjoy an excellent cup of the world 's most popular drink - coffee . #% On these and other grounds , we have decided to abstain on the resolution . #% But I frankly believe that this is a false promise which really offers very little practical benefit to the countries that we are all , I hope , trying to help . #% Freedom of movement in the European Union has been a real success story , and when our citizens choose to exercise that right by living in -- and often retiring to -- another Member State , they deserve our protection and support . #% It is particularly galling that , of the six named phthalates to be banned , five are not even used for children 's toys and only two are suspected on the basis of unreplicated tests on rats . #% However , you are quite right and I support you . #% Surely we should be told who has asked for a roll call vote . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party fully supports reform of the UN Security Council , in order that it better reflects today 's world , and also supports improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN . #% One of these is Amendment No 18 , which I see the trade unions are supporting , while curiously claiming that many employers support it , too . #% Why are the CSTEE minutes not published until April , and why has a statement critical of the Commission 's misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the research still not been published ? #% Sadly , reports such as these can not see their own great contradiction . #% The third pillar is a vital repository of national competences arrived at through historic development , reflecting different cultural and social histories of the nations . #% He highlights the need to put in place an effective advance warning and monitoring system ; he encourages prompt and appropriate political responses ; he agrees with the G7 's request to the IMF to establish new procedures regarding finance mechanisms and , of course , he calls again , through the G7 , for strengthening international cooperation . #% At the Laeken Summit , Heads of Government should commit themselves to a thorough review of the degree of respect in practice for the standards we have signed up to in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Mr President , there can not be anyone in the House who is not aware of the most important rule in politics : when you are in a hole , stop digging . #% We also support the efforts of the presidency to open up the issue of the future revision clause . #% But there are worrying signs that both Hong Kong 's economic success and its political and civil freedoms could be put at risk after the hand-over on 1 July . #% The second point concerns sea-fishing . #% In that spirit , could he look again at the 2004 electromagnetic fields directive and the serious impact it could have on the use of state-of-the-art MRI scanners and see his way to bringing forward an amendment to this directive to make sure that MRI scanners will be protected in the future ? #% Anyway , I would like to thank colleagues in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their amendments which have generally improved the report substantially . #% Europe responded swiftly , supporting providing not just the powerful antibiotics and the intravenous fluids , but water purification systems and disposable , protective gear . #% In the UK an independent body of experts which advises the Government expressed serious concern about the presence of a bacterial gene in the modified maize which is coded for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin . #% By reaching out to Turkey we underline that the EU is not based on an exclusive European identity , but of an inclusive one . #% I understand that a Hungarian player who has had his transfer put on hold is probably going to mount a legal challenge . #% I am sure we all agree that the mass culls that followed should never be seen again . #% Women were once , in the 1960s and 1970s , welcomed by the government of King Mohammed Zahir Shah as full participating members of society in their professions , in higher education and in politics . #% I support the Tibetans in their peaceful struggle to leave the grip of China and hope that they will pray for the people of the UK in their struggle to leave the dead hand of the European Union . #% I agree with him that our citizens are genuinely concerned by the process . #% It is about giving homosexuals the equal rights and equality that others take so much for granted . #% It will also help us face up to enlargement . #% I then become aware of stem cell research and how this might lead to a breakthrough for sufferers like me . #% We should congratulate the coalition armed forces for their restraint and their great success . #% Unlike one of the previous speakers , I would like to see the Dalai Lama coming here and addressing Parliament . #% Finally , the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system , what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support . #% Those are two words : ` candid ' and ` friend ' ; so let me be a candid friend to Israel first of all . #% This morning speakers have been talking about the past , of Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli . #% The Commission hopes to obscure the principal issue , namely its quest for legal personality or EU sovereignty . #% I am pleased also that a sensible compromise was reached on early intervention powers , which could be a useful addition to the armoury of the regulators in securing proper prudential supervision . #% 
I believe it is much better , in the public interest , that we have well-regulated online gambling services than uncontrolled services which come into Europe from other countries outside the remit of the European Union . #% To that question I now add another : what are the European Union 's connections to the Global Security Fund and what relationship does it have with European Union institutions ? #% To the Corus workers in the north-east of England or Wales , to the Vauxhall workers in Luton - or , for that matter , the Danone workers in France and Holland - the idea of a corporate code of responsibility - as I said in an earlier debate - is a sick joke , quite frankly . #% Mr President , the honourable Member 's approach to these and many other matters is I know extremely constructive . #% The Council has indicated that it is unwilling to accept further amendments from Parliament . #% I have not come across a single employer who supports this . #% I think that , when we are looking at this , we are always looking at it from the point of view of the problem that we have and sometimes tend to underestimate the daily reality for people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan of the many deaths , the targeted killings of the Hazara population , for example , in parts of Pakistan , the attacks on girls ' schools , on the police and so many others . #% I may be the only person in this room to do so but I will certainly vote against because I feel that strongly about it . #% Clearly North Korea is a state of concern . #% The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis . #% We are dealing with the oral amendment by the PPE-DE Group and then the amendment by the UEN Group -- which Mr Schulz seems to be amending again -- but not the rest of the revised amendment by the UEN Group , to which I think Mr Cohn-Bendit is referring . #% However , even this poses difficulties . #% Politicians must be accountable and responsible for their decisions . #% UKIP believes it is morally wrong for MEPs to vote on an issue which could lead to personal enrichment . #% We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms . #% We in this House should push the Israelis and the Palestinians to get back to the negotiating table and push the United States to take an active part in making sure there is a Palestinian state created and that there is a long-term solution in the Middle East . #% The EU has allowed a situation to develop where we can not prosecute terrorists , but we can persecute terrorist suspects and deprive them of their rights . #% I would urge that we must never hesitate ; we must apply the same rules and standards regardless . #% The Spaniards have just voted on the Constitution , but the fact is that 90 % of Spaniards -- whom the Europhiles think were well informed about the Constitution -- told Spain 's state polling organisation that they had little or no knowledge of it , and less than half of them bothered to vote . #% Well , now it has happened and it is called Article 47 , and it is called this Maltese Commissioner , Joe Borg . #% I urge the Committee on Agriculture and others who quite rightly care about European citizens and farmers to take a much broader view of the context of agriculture in the world . #% I am not worried about voting for the Dell ` Alba report . #% I want to put the question on behalf of the British Association of Ski Instructors as this is also a question for them . #% But I have to say that these solutions will never be affordable or accessible to the tens of millions of the world ' s poorest people . #% Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report . #% The Convention certainly examined all the options , refined all the arguments , and took a broad political approach with the common interest of Europe very much at the centre of our work . #% We have to make sure that at the end of the process we have a European Union which is effective and efficient , built on democratic legitimacy , which respects the relationship between small and large states and which respects the principle of subsidiarity . #% I am extremely worried that if someone were now to approach and gain access via either the Commission 's decision or the Council 's decision we would see a violation of the regulation . #% There is a procedural problem in this House . #% Freedom from the yoke of a terrible tyranny has been achieved . #% That point is precisely at the centre of the dispute over the 1992 agreement on large aircraft construction . #% At the beginning of September there were some indications that Mugabe might be prepared to respond to international pressure . #% Each insurance company will have to appoint a designated representative or agent in each Member State and the victim will process the claim directly with that designated representative . #% Can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent ? #% . Mr President , I should like to report to the House that , following the debate last night and discussions with the presidency , in the spirit of compromise reflecting our work on this portfolio , I am mandated by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy to withdraw Amendments Nos 3 and 11 . #% We should remember that it does mean real improvements in water quality within the ` good ' and ` excellent ' categories now proposed . #% However , now it is being used as a political instrument to bash Israel and the settlements . #% author . - Mr President , the people of Sri Lanka - Sinhalese and particularly the Tamils - have suffered enormously over these past 30 years from a ruthless terrorist campaign conducted by the LTTE . #% They can not have a veto on the future of the EU . #% Mr President , we welcome this report so deftly piloted through Parliament by Mrs Wallis because , in the brave new world of e-commerce , there is going to be the same share of crooks and mountebanks as in the non-digital environment . #% We need to support the Commission in their efforts to bring this complex sector into line with other CAP reforms not argue to retain the status quo . #% We have a lot to celebrate today . #% We need the European arrest warrant ; we also need a programme of equivalence in common minimum high standards . #% As one conflict ends another begins , as the half a million returnees expected in Timor by December this year go to demonstrate . #% This is a first attempt , as many people have said , at talking about the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002 . #% We should be aware that uniformity can stifle innovation and prevent adaptation to local or national circumstances and problems . #% You have stripped them not just of money ; you have stripped them of their democracy . #% I believe there is a case to be made for India and Japan to be given permanent membership status as a result of their size and democratic status . #% Indeed , many of us want budget cuts and a reduction in Britain 's excessive contribution . ( ... ) . #% I will now turn briefly if I may to transport and just say to members that I hope they are able to support the Committee on Budgets ' moves to restore the cuts to the transport safety line and the cuts to the line on sustainable mobility . #% Unfortunately -- I have had some experience as the originator of this democracy programme -- it is now rather bureaucratic and errs on the side of safety . #% It is our joint challenge to enable everyone in the new wider Europe to live freely in a safer world , of which Europe is just one part . #% EU air pollution limits are significantly exceeded along London 's major road network , in Central London and around Heathrow Airport , where nitrogen dioxide is 50 % above the limit , due to a combination of aeroplanes and vehicles . #% It has to reconcile the six countries who wanted to limit EU spending to 1 % of GDP with those who want a much larger budget . #% It also wants SMEs to benefit from the growth in markets . #% Yes , we can do that if it would be helpful . #% I further welcome what you said about the modified risk weight curve and retail lending and collateral . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank President Abbas for giving me this unexpected opportunity to contribute to this debate . #% - The agenda of the IGC has now been set by the Member States . #% Therefore , we need to build into this method time for real consultation , not just here in Parliament but also for NGOs to exercise their own internal democracy in making their contributions as well . #% I was somewhat relieved that it was not Commissioner Fischler , who comes from a landlocked country , who answered my question . #% There was an interesting report in the UK press at the weekend about Germany : Chancellor Schröder was apparently finding it increasingly difficult to get acceptance of much-needed labour market reforms because the social partners were blocking them . #% When you consider that at the moment in the UK there are women graduates likely to earn less than male graduates with similar degrees at the start of their careers , then there is a problem . #% It is an outrage that people who can barely scrape together enough to keep body and soul together should be squeezed to pay back loans to the rich . #% The Commission adopted the proposal for the third directive only about a year ago and today it is before us for decision . #% I conclude by saying that in our Parliament we need to network with the national parliaments , the Council needs to give us the lead through the heads of state in each of the Member States and last , the Commission can produce guidelines so that we know what course this debate will follow . #% 
I hope that you and the College of Quaestors will take this seriously because it is an encroachment on the right of Members to come to this House and vote freely on issues that their electors have sent them here to debate . #% There must be joint EU pressure on the US to secure civilian trials with normal safeguards . #% But if further serious breaches are reported , resolution 1441 has to be followed through . #% The continuing refusal to deal with some of those elements in Hamas who want to take a step towards us just makes promotion of peace in the Middle East impossible to attain . #% I am glad to hear that the rapporteur has very much moved towards the amendment which the ELDR group tabled . #% This is a matter that should be determined for them at a local level . #% Could the Commissioner please tell us why the Commission 's line has changed from this morning and why it is refusing to publish this document so that the discharge of the Commission 's budget can proceed as urgently and speedily as possible ? #% Again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity . #% Does the Commissioner not agree with me that we need to to be able to offer the citizens of the European Union clear guidance about the progress of research ? #% The result could be that we have not served the interests of either Asia or Latin America . #% Here I also owe a debt to the Commission for its help , to the Swedish Presidency , which has taken this through with a commendable sense of urgency , and most of all to my own parliamentary assistant , Michele Smyth who has laboured tirelessly on all of this . #% People can and do achieve , despite severe physical and mental disabilities . #% This is a single market issue ; this House should not be standing in the way of the completion of the single market but should be actively promoting it . #% Not only are they undermining the position of companies which actively want this proposal , they are also undermining the good work that has been done in this Parliament over the last nine or ten years . #% Many people have already referred to the basic four freedoms of the EU . #% It is particularly important for lawyers in England and Wales as English law is an international commercial law . #% What we are about is creating new rules to look at who can play and on what terms . #% Yesterday , a Parliament spokesman said that the protests had caused considerable damage , but what will be the damage in British ports if this directive is applied ? #% Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences - not least , perhaps , to their future employment - of reporting such an injury . #% So our task must be to support aid and sustainable development projects and to look for political solutions . #% All these problems suggest that voluntary partnerships , however good our intentions , will have difficulty delivering the goals . #% I do not think that including self-employed people in this particular legislation is burdensome . #% Mr President , this debate on Mrs Morgantini 's report is about the link that we need to make between trade liberalisation , economic growth and poverty . #% I would like to conclude by saying to all those who are likely to be the important players in the end game : do not faff about . #% If people are going to be interested in Europe , they have to know about it . #% We have only to look at the increase in trafficking and the difficulty in recruiting skilled professionals to demonstrate this . #% The only remaining issue to be resolved , as the Commissioner and Mrs Sornosa Martínez pointed out , is that of barometers . #% If the Commission had clear and accepted priorities and could see the wood for the trees , we would not be having this debate this afternoon . #% There is no universality , so there is no Taiwan gap . #% Notwithstanding all the other issues , but bearing in mind the fact that the people of the North of Cyprus voted for membership of the EU , could the EU not , at the very least , see its way forward to allowing direct flights to Northern Cyprus ? #% Will you in particular ask when the law passed in June this year requiring crimes against humanity committed by the Colombian military to be transferred to the jurisdiction of civil courts will actually be implemented . #% Why should we contribute towards it ? #% It should more properly be entitled `` How can Saddam Hussein be controlled more effectively ? '' #% Do you agree with me that this is an outrageous affront to free speech and that it flies directly in the face of the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights ? #% Nevertheless , the Commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place . #% This report had a long gestation period . #% Commissioner Georgieva was on the scene , and , when I met with Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani , I was certainly able to discuss the EU 's response with him . #% As long as fish are considered to be a common European resource , there will be no sense of ownership or responsibility . #% Finally , does Mr Duisenberg believe that it was a wise decision to have the euro banknotes printed by the eleven separate Member States ? #% The fact that there were over 200 amendments at the committee stage for what was and is an own-initiative report , is hopefully seen as a reflection of their priority and not entirely down to the inadequacy of the rapporteur in the first place . #% Are we really saying that we are going to turn the tide of history by telling China to turn into a democratic country with full human rights overnight , just on the basis of one report from the European Parliament ? #% But in cases where export capacity exists , in countries like South Africa , Mauritius , Ghana , Botswana and certain Caribbean countries , then one does see export growth as a result . #% Therefore to do nothing is to condone human rights abuses wherever they occur . #% Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched . #% However , we need a mechanism to draw all the threads together and that means a temporary committee . #% Many of my party members and constituents share that sensitivity and are alarmed at the Nice developments which seem to place far too much power in the hands of unelected Commission officials . #% Fifty-two million people are afflicted with epilepsy in our world ; 80 % of them are not treated ; 70 % could live seizure-free lives with comparatively cheap five-euros-a-day anti-epileptic drugs . #% She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland . #% This is an important sign of our support and solidarity with Taiwan which , under President Ma 's inspired leadership , has sought pragmatic solutions to the international isolation imposed on it by the People 's Republic of China . #% There are , however , some differences between the proposed code as now drafted by the Ombudsman , which I hope that this House will support , and the codes currently in use . #% Too many men can not cope . #% I should like to highlight , once again , one of the key issues that has already been raised and on which my group has tabled an amendment , namely the contribution of complementary and alternative medicine . #% I fear that we are moving forwards with the EIO whilst its very foundations , and the European Arrest Warrant on which it is based , are decidedly shaky . #% I can only hope that these new elections teach all of Ukraine 's politicians the lessons that must be learnt if Ukraine is to join Europe 's democratic nations in going forward in partnership . #% This is important in terms of continuity and stability for individuals , society and business . #% Therefore , the kind generosity of my friend in the Socialist Group in reducing it to half an hour is cutting it not to half but to one third of what it should be . #% So tell me where the problem is . #% Mr Barroso recently claimed that regulations might be cut . #% The text in the English version is not clear and it would be useful if that were tidied up when the translations are verified . #% I am encouraged that even in this Parliament , just one month ago , over 100 Members voted against the Senegal deal . #% It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 1441 actually says . #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on producing a report which is a fine balance of the arguments and interests involved . #% We need to be certain of the rules , qualifications and funding of all applicants , however obscure . #% There are precedents for delaying the debate for some period of time . #% That will be very welcome as part of the conditions for release of the staff reserve will be a statement from the Commission in February next year . #% In my own country we have a very thriving small canal boat industry to which Commissioner Patten has just referred . #% 
The second issue , mentioned briefly by Mrs Gebhardt , concerns cover provided for citizens who take up temporary positions in other EU-Member States , such as students moving to a university wishing to take a car with them ; workers on secondment or members of families moving to another country for a temporary period . #% Our Conservative position has been set out by the Conservative Leader Mr McMillan-Scott . #% In the end we urged the Commission to collate more information on the state of play in the accession countries . #% It is something that we should deal with as promptly as possible , because starving the terrorist of his funds is just as important as subjecting him to military attack . #% Mr President , I certainly agree with Mr Bowe 's final summary . #% However , please do not assume that is the wish of this House . #% . Mr President , I have served in national parliaments where debates were timetabled to a second and the inability of this Parliament to get its act together means I have to apologise to the Commissioner because I will have to leave before hearing his concluding remarks . #% I would like to give you five reasons why we need a Europe-wide campaign against violence to women . #% I have been told by the university ' s advisors that it will not resist so long as the disclaimer which may be added to the patent continues to allow them to carry out their lawful work on human tissue . #% Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur . #% I believe that it will help reassure EU citizens that human rights are being upheld by the ` Brussels bureaucrats ' and by EU governments when they are implementing European law . #% Those who currently do not have a negotiated position for more than one payment for their own activities are the losers in all of that . #% I wish you and members of the conciliation delegation , and the Commissioner and her staff , a merry Christmas . #% So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that , I would be grateful . #% The left in Europe remain wedded to the old ways of inflexible labour markets , high non-wage labour costs and other barriers to growth . #% We owe our constituents our judgement , and mine is that for all its flaws and deficiencies , the directive is one that should be commended , with amendments , to those many people who are frightened and nervous , who depend on these food supplements to preserve their health , and some of whom even believe it is a matter of life or death . #% Healthy people are succumbing as fast as , or faster than , the very old and the very young . #% I am concerned about the practicality and cost of having to post-mortem all animals for which the cause of death is unknown . #% The suspicion amongst many in the United Kingdom is that these issues and the high-minded pronouncements are yet another power play by stealth on the part of the EU and its institutions . #% We can continue to pursue that balance between flexibility and security . #% Three , my Group is wholly in support of an increase and improvement in the Ombudsman 's investigative powers . #% Nevertheless I , like everyone else , will support the compromise tomorrow . #% This enlarged Europe must be for the benefit of the world as a whole . #% Lastly , I dislike the garish design and colour scheme of some of the carpeting in the bar areas , reminiscent , as pointed out by another Member , of a cheap night-club rather than the desired dignified atmosphere of this house . #% We support especially those elements which expand the European Union ' s capacity for action in global affairs : those that strengthen the status and the profile of the citizen , including the Charter ; and those that will postulate further political reform in the interests of a strong executive and a mature parliamentary democracy . #% We argue in defence of the right of privacy whilst our citizens ' lives are being physically damaged , undermined and sometimes terminated . #% The term ` family reason ' in the amendment is , in my view , too vague . #% Frankly , if we are concerned with the competitiveness of the European Union and if we are particularly concerned about job creation then we need to ensure that the growth capacity of our economy is expanded . #% The controversial question is different . #% Question time is the one opportunity that backbenchers have to challenge the Presidency-in-Office ; it is supposed to be one full hour . #% In short , it is a carrot-and-stick situation . #% Mr President , last month in the UK , in a region that neighbours mine , the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres . #% This is a lesson for our committee on other dossiers too . #% But the fact is that , as the old joke says , ` if you line up all the economists around the world head to toe , you may never reach a conclusion ' . #% That is a court case that is ongoing . #% We do , however , recycle waste oil produced from such establishments as fish and chip shops , that monument to the culinary art , but also from other catering establishments and private homes that produce waste cooking oil . #% Although the right try to deny it , the 1999 Framework Directive clearly imposes a duty on employers to assess all occupational risks . #% A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005 , but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion . #% Now we have a proper process , a proper interinstitutional dialogue . #% But as Terry Wynn said , when we were in the Windward Islands last week , we actually faced the stark realities that people in those islands are facing themselves , as they try to meet the challenge from dollar bananas . #% If the Council does that , how would the Commissioner assess the value of the financial perspective ? #% But , still in the Balkans , Croatia 's bilateral border dispute with Slovenia must not be a barrier to joining the EU , and I hope that Macedonia will also be opening negotiations shortly . #% In addition to severe structural problems like lack of investment , the public debt , particularly foreign debt , has grown rapidly and at present it is not clear how the authorities intend to service that debt burden . #% In the last couple of years I have seen that there is something of an addiction to gesture politics here , which is something we must be extremely careful to avoid in our relationships with the United States of America . #% Are we unintentionally making women less employable by demanding that businesses offer rights that they can not deliver in today 's economic climate ? #% However , there can be no trade-off between the two , the clause and the softer revision procedures needed for a Constitution to work well and fluently in practice . #% Of course we recognise the fact that we need a rules-based system to regulate world trade but let us see more openness , let us see more and better ways of achieving and building global consensus . #% The listing of category imposes costs on farmers and butchers , and at the same time would give consumers irrelevant or misleading information . #% We also strongly support the report 's aims regarding EU funds being better spent and better allocated in order to fully support the Roma people . #% Article 23 of the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights says that no one shall be forced to leave the country of his residence or be arbitrarily deported therefrom . #% The second lesson -- and we hardly need to learn it from Afghanistan or Iraq , because it is so obvious -- is : ` it 's the economy , stupid ! ' #% For the music and entertainment sector , I think we have established a very good approach . #% To restate Zola , ` J'accuse ' - I accuse - the parties of the British political establishment : their support for the European Arrest Warrant has put everyone in Britain at risk of random arrest . #% 30 August marked three months of detention at the end of 13 years of open prison for Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy . #% The rights of Chilean citizens , including elected representatives , were not respected when they were confined in the sports stadium , tortured and killed . #% I condemn as well the brutal and widespread use of the death sentence for lesser crimes - such as economic subversion and pimping , believe it or not . #% No one pretends that it is perfect . #% Firstly , a high level of consumer protection . #% The French beef ban , as everyone but the French Government agrees , is illegal and totally unjustified . #% Finally , if there is a criticism that has to be made of the Commission , and I am glad it has realised the importance of this criticism , it is that its White Paper did not address the role of Parliament . #% Opting out from the working time directive is voluntary : nobody can legally be forced to sign an opt-out and it is important to give people the flexibility to work longer hours and earn the overtime if they wish . #% First of all , no-one here this evening should claim that budgetisation is a silver bullet for the ACP for the delivery of the EDF . #% Would Mr Simitis agree with me that unless we can modify the future revision procedures we will be forever trapped in the dual lock of unanimity plus national ratification procedures - frequently protracted and problematical ? #% However , I find myself unable to support it because of the inclusion of paragraph 8 on Austria . #% There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation . #% We call on the UN Security Council to consider the rapid constitution and deployment of a UN peacekeeping operation to support the peace process at this crucial moment and to strengthen and complement the African Union 's peacekeeping mission , which has already been deployed . #% 
Many of them are still more potential than production , and we must be realistic about how successful we have been in achieving target levels of energy from renewable sources . #% While , for other diseases , we had 2 100 projects in clinical development . #% Mr President , this debate has shown that the procedure on the 1996 discharge has been the most difficult ever . #% On that basis I commend this proposal to the House . #% We have , Mr Commissioner , to make sure that the world does not stop looking on this occasion and we want to make sure that action is taken . #% Compromise was very necessary . #% However , this resolution does not sufficiently address the fact that most of these fires seem to have been deliberately started by arsonists . #% Article 9 of the directive requires that members be given sufficient information on risks . #% Listening to some of the speeches you have heard this evening , you would think that option was under threat . #% We simply can not support such an appalling set of proposals , particularly as Baroness Ludford 's approach could have the unfortunate result of turning the majority against the minority rather than harmonising relations . #% Property owners who have lost out through collusion between property developers and the local authorities in Valencia must be properly compensated . #% It would be helpful if the invitations could be officially sent earlier . #% For the eleventh year in succession , the Court has been unable to give a statement of assurance on the accounts . #% in writing . - I wish to confirm my support for this report . #% We are in favour of having a stability pact that looks at the wider employment and economic implications for Europe , a pact that contain spending and borrowing at reasonable prudent levels , but which allows countries to take the necessary steps to prevent their economies slipping into recession . #% We ought to be seeing a much stronger role for parliaments to play in this process because by having a parliamentary dimension we will ensure that nobody turns a blind eye to cronyism and corruption . #% This weekend , I attended a vigil in London to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of Brian Douglas at the hands of the police . #% All trade agreements refer to the territory where the goods are produced , not the nationality or the religion of the producers . #% I can not accept Amendments Nos 10 , 11 , 12 or 15 because these restrict the scope of the proposal . #% We also had the problem that many of those people were told that compensation , or even refunds , would not be possible as they had not purchased their ticket with a credit card or booked through a travel agent . #% If , as you just said in your statement , the accounts are so reliable , then why write those things in your report ? #% However , I would like to ask what else - this is only the first step - will the presidency be doing or does it think it has already done during this presidency to achieve more in the field of the environment and completely sweep away this image of the UK as being ` the dirty man of Europe ' ? #% That is perpetuating a second-class citizen status . #% The whole approach of the common asylum policy is integral to the work of our committee and we are very much committed to it . #% With reference to the previous speaker 's remarks , we should remember that the United States is carrying enormous burdens on behalf of all of us and we should stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in these difficult times . #% in writing . - Whilst the ECR Group supports much of what is contained in the Stockholm Programme , such as cooperation and solidarity over issues of policing , fighting cross-border crime and corruption , protecting fundamental rights , and finding solutions for immigration by seeking to assist those countries in southern Europe that face serious immigration problems , we do not support proposals for a European Security Strategy , or measures which would hand over control of our criminal justice system and asylum policy to the EU , or calls for ` compulsory and irrevocable solidarity ' . #% I would also like to support the rapporteur when he questions the Commission on how far vague concepts will be applied in concrete terms . #% ` What 's a Luxembourger ? ' says my mate . #% There are just two issues I would like to highlight , both of which have already been addressed more eloquently by my colleagues Mr Pronk and Mrs Bastos . #% Mr President , at the start of this debate Mr Poettering referred to a resolution from the PPE-DE Group . #% I would also like to thank our colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who have worked so hard in reaching what I think is a sensible practical compromise and Mr Katiforis who has brought a lot of detailed technical knowledge from the Economic and Monetary Committee to this debate . #% Lastly , cancelling the debt of the world ' s poorest countries would also help the young people of those nations considerably . #% When we met Louise Arbour , the Commissioner for Human Rights , in Geneva , and when she made her return visit to us in Brussels , we explored in detail her proposals for the universal review procedure now agreed , which will enable , it is argued , a much stronger , more objective examination of the record of all countries . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I live on a lovely island - a beautiful island - which has been systematically destroyed by the European Union over the last 15 years . #% This does not sound too bad a compromise . #% If not , when will it be in operation ? #% You said you wanted to focus on the Lisbon Agenda . #% However , you have forgotten something : you have forgotten about the people , you have forgotten about public opinion . #% There are a number of important priorities the committee on Development has identified relating to the central role of women in the development process . #% It is high time they did . #% So that is the first message of the report : that we need to go a little further . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the measures under discussion are part of the existing so-called area of justice , freedom and security , of which immigration is a part . #% The Commission 's view is that when a women does a job which is as demanding as a man 's she ought to receive the same pay and benefits , even if it is a different job . #% When they came for me - there was no one left to speak out . '' #% It is a treaty in form , but a constitution in substance . #% This is an opportunity that we ourselves must not miss . #% Nevertheless the shadow of conflict hanging over the region makes it even more difficult to see human rights significantly improve in either country . #% Let us hope that we now get that timetable . #% Let me just clarify one or two other points . #% That in itself can not be a cause to delay Romanian and Bulgarian accession any further , although there is a case to be made for invoking the one-year safeguard clauses in regard to particular chapters such as justice and home affairs . #% There may be many other ways in which the European Union and the European Commission can facilitate cross-border clearing and settlement , without necessarily having to resort to a hard law solution . #% Like any annual report , this one has its limits . #% Also related is whether action can be taken on sites that are fed in from other Internet service providers from outside the European Union . #% Some months ago I wrote to the President of the Commission asking a formal written question , as I am entitled to do as a Member . #% Can I first say that of course , AIDS and HIV are themselves not prejudiced . #% Is that so , Mr Juncker ? #% Firstly , on the outcome of the conciliation process itself : the deal which has been achieved is probably the best that Parliament could realistically hope to expect . #% The EPLP could not agree that the directive needs to be included as a ` Lamfalussy ' type of directive , which was the suggestion of Amendment 6 . #% He and others would be very welcome to visit my constituency . #% We also welcome the rapprochement between NATO and Russia which now shares a common agenda with the EU in the fight against global terrorism and the goal of becoming a functioning market economy as a member of WTO and at peace with its EU neighbours . #% In addition , companies face fierce US competition which threatens their survival . #% I would like to first of all express my condolences to the much-afflicted people of Zimbabwe at the awful bus crash that took place near Masvingo in Zimbabwe last night , when over 30 trainee teachers were killed . #% But anyone who recalls the asbestos tragedy will know that money invested in the testing now can save thousands of lives and millions of pounds downstream . #% The police forces are to be given no such choice : the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , gave the 43 Chief Constables an ultimatum to produce plans for a mass merger , like it or not . #% I wonder , on the basis of your five years ' experience at the head of the Executive , what your top tip would be for your successor as regards the conduct of relations with this Parliament ? #% Applying the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees all over Europe in a proper manner is still the best way of dealing with asylum issues . #% 
Furthermore , issuing debt , which risks increasing the EU budget and directly guaranteeing EU lending , is a major departure that undermines the principles of sound public finance which we are supposed here to be reinforcing . #% In fact , the President decided to refer it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure . #% It is perfectly entitled to apply for a contract . #% We have seen what happened in France and the Netherlands and the fact that people do not trust the European Union , Parliament and the Commission . #% For the purpose of facilitating the investigation the proposal includes a carriage requirement of a voyage data recorder - a black box . #% Mr President , I shall be abstaining from voting on Mr Trichet 's appointment partly because , as the UK is not a member of the eurozone , I tend to act cautiously in speaking on these internal matters of organisation in relation to the euro , and partly because I have mixed feelings about Mr Trichet 's appointment . #% The House will be aware , of course , that the Commission can not fulfil these objectives alone . #% If you accept market disciplines and the opening-up of a market , you must expect reconstruction ; you must expect firms to close and look for new possibilities . #% If we get that right , we will go a long way towards managing the challenge of change . #% We must learn the lessons from this terrible blight to our countryside , farmers and the rural population . #% Citizens will also judge us more by what we do than what we say . #% We need safe cosmetic products . #% President Barroso enjoined us this morning to be proud of Europe and its values . #% In this long gestation , it is easy to forget that some of the things in this recast were actually considered quite radical when they were first raised . #% They should be subject either to US law or to the rule of international law : legal representation , a fair trial and the right of appeal . #% I am afraid to say that some of my colleagues are still living in the past and calling it the ` Bolkestein Directive ' . #% It is the Member States who are dragging their feet on Lisbon and on the European arrest warrant . #% In particular , I think the ability of manufacturers of all scales and sizes to be able to get their vehicles approved by a national type-approval authority to a European regulation and to be able to sell those vehicles in every market across the European Union is a major step forward . #% I want to emphasise that one of the EU 's great strengths lies in its variety of different institutions : they have different and complementary roles . #% Recently the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy of Parliament asked for a high representative to be appointed to Kosovo . #% In voting for the Ceyhun report we recognise the complexities of this issue and will continue to work for a full and common asylum system for the European Union that has humanity and the interests of the most vulnerable at its core . #% The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment . #% My first is a general one : to what extent are we talking about fraud , Mr Friedmann , as opposed to mismanagement of funds ? #% Europe must look at Asia and consider its astonishing growth as an opportunity rather than a threat . #% Nineteen soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered . #% In working towards a common policy for fifteen countries and ultimately twenty-five , there will always be some variations in detail . #% For instance , for the country strategy papers , I can find no evidence that parliaments were consulted in any meaningful way , although civil society and NGOs were quite rightly involved . #% We do not have time for me to go through the six specific questions I asked but I have to say that my luck with the Commissioner is rather like my luck with the United Kingdom lottery . #% If we fail to do that , then we will fail in our Lisbon Strategy . #% There was , eventually , a derisory offer of 200 peacekeepers from France -- even Bangladesh managed more than that , and quicker ! #% I do not know - and I conducted some research into this - what is happening as regards such research within the Framework Programme , either the present one or the one which is planned . #% COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat #% Because the burden-sharing was clearly unfair , we have an opportunity here . #% The ELDR is concerned that Amendment No 13 may delay the implementation of the management measures and also believes that Amendment No 15 could potentially have a negative impact on the environment . #% We welcome the reassurances from Commissioner Piebalgs that he will keep Parliament informed in advance , but we need similar cast-iron reassurances from the Council too . #% In the recent past , we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998 . #% We should recall today the major contribution she has made to the cause of freedom on this continent . #% Madam President , I appeal to you to write to the Taliban authorities about the unfortunate case of Shelter Now . #% Madam President , outside the door of this Chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet . #% But what there has not been is fully developed two-way scientific cooperation between Africa and the EU . #% I quote in conclusion : `` The Commission was unable to support the approach and in consequence did not amend its original proposal . '' #% Mr President , the President-in-Office mentioned a forthcoming decision about putting some documents of the Council in the public domain on the Internet . #% Fourthly , does what we are doing help responsible companies ? #% But , be that as it may , it does not excuse or justify the rampant homophobia that exists widely in some parts of Africa . #% Finally , we will only manage to focus on poverty if we reallocate properly our use of resources . #% We also all support the waste hierarchy where it is best to prevent , it is next best to re-use and recycle , and after that comes energy recovery . #% In particular , it is absolutely right that this specific initiative - growth and employment - should be discussed within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , although it is clearly also of interest to other committees . #% Such a call ignores the democratically expressed wishes of the people and does this House no credit . #% To polish up his international image he has , to his credit I suppose , compensated grieving families , but in truth , the maverick Gaddafi would be totally ostracised by the West were it not for Libya 's prodigious reserves of oil and gas . #% Taken together those are fairly serious weaknesses , although the committee is collectively doing its very best to overcome them . #% I agree that there should be justice , but there should be no recriminations , no reprisals , no revenge , and , as all the institutions of Europe affirm in unanimity in this debate , no dilution of respect for human rights . #% Mr President , I welcome with satisfaction the proposals before us because I believe that not only will aviation safety in general be improved , but this will also strengthen cooperation procedures , as well as reinforcing preventive strategies . #% The trouble is , when you talk about nuclear issues - especially Sellafield - it is dominated by a distortion of the truth . #% I say that to whoever is doing it outside : lay off , because we will not allow our fellow Member to suffer in that way . #% Finally , it should complete the revision of the financial system of the EU , to produce a fair , transparent and buoyant budget that will permit us to match financial resources to our policy objectives . #% An Iranian nuclear device could turn out to be the biggest suicide bomb the world has ever seen . #% We endorse the strong commitment of the British government to the evolution of the ESDP and to maintaining the integrity of NATO . #% Thirdly , it requires a stable currency which can go anywhere in the world . #% Similarly , Nigeria or Brazil could be candidates . #% I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics , some of which are now - thankfully - gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU . #% It is the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the key to that supply chain , the innovative industries who are now designing , who are involved in value-added manufacturing services . #% Many other sections of Bulgarian society face difficulties , but the Roma question is important , not just for the stability and prosperity of Bulgaria , but also because of its potential impact on other countries in the European Union , not least my own , when Bulgaria achieves full membership . #% I believe that the fifth framework programme will be part and parcel of that , when it comes . #% One day `` EU origin '' may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment . #% I have to subscribe to BSkyB another channel if I want to follow my team . #% Can you confirm that in that phrase you are talking only about the year 2000 ? #% 
You gave the floor to someone that was opposing the position which the rapporteur had taken on this particular issue . #% So far as the allowances are concerned , there has at present been a provision available to European civil servants since the 1960s which allows them to make transfers of parts of their salaries to their home countries . #% He was far from absent , of course , because he was sitting in front of me waiting for an answer . #% The drop in consumption Europe-wide has been between 10 % and 15 % , so we have to cut production or we have to promote the eating of beef . #% There is indeed , as earlier speakers have said , considerable overlap between their programmes , and I believe that their management and administration , at least , could usefully be merged . #% I welcome the strengthening of political and economic dialogue and engagement as well as discussions on human rights at the India-EU Summit on 13 October . #% I accept that this is a matter in which there ought to be more choice and it is an issue of striking the right balance . #% The Commission strategy for change across the policy spectrum must be framed inside a constitutional context . #% The ECB took on all the assets and liabilities of the EMI . #% Services represent 75 % or thereabouts ( there is some debate/disputes over the exact numbers ) of the EU 's GDP compared to only about 2 % for agriculture . #% Five -- on air , waste , sustainable use of resources , marine and aviation -- would be with us before the summer . #% Our citizens know where their local courts are , but will they know how or where to access the EEJ Net ? #% That is why I particularly deplore the U-turn by the British Foreign Secretary , Margaret Beckett , which completely contradicts both the views of her Prime Minister and the general thrust of reform and transparency in the European Union . #% However , there are other energy sources that we must remember . #% We must have stricter controls at all EU ports and airports to stop such meat getting into Europe -- witness , colleagues , the devastation caused by foot-and-mouth outbreaks across Europe . #% I shall finish with the words of a former President of the Court of Justice , who said , ` the Court does not take political decisions but it does sometimes have to remind politicians of the decisions that they have taken ' . #% I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas . #% So we must keep the importance of that peace process very much in our minds . #% This problem was brought to my attention by a constituent in the city of Leeds who has a small company selling DVDs - the kind of materials you mentioned - and employs 31 people . #% It is as a direct result of the improper influence which Chiquita exerted over the US Administration that the complaint was originally made to the WTO . #% I would like , on behalf of the committee , to thank Mrs Müller for the immense amount of work she has put into this report . #% I would also like to say , just to correct something that Mrs Morgan said earlier , that I am very lucky in this debate , because my party declared in our manifesto - which helped so many of us on this side get elected - that we would not give discharge to any EU accounts until the Commission reform process had been successfully implemented . #% I hope and pray that we vote to leave , but either way the people simply must be asked . #% Given the amount of paper we have received this morning , if these votes are going to continue , will the President look into the provision of extra trunks for Members in future to allow us to get the results back to our offices in Brussels ? #% So the idea that there has been sort of British conspiracy within the Commission is utterly fanciful and unworthy of a report of this House . #% Mr President , progress towards stability in Macedonia is a real example of how cooperation between NATO , the EU and the US can have very beneficial effects . #% So I tabled a question at Question Time asking for an explanation and miraculously - but maybe there was no connection - the French Presidency and the Commission got together to negotiate to remove the blockage . #% This is an area of enormous development and I am interested to hear that this has in fact been through Parliament before and was then withdrawn . #% These international accounting standards seem to hold out such a promise , both within and beyond the European Union . #% When the Consumers ' Association in Britain tested this out on a random sample of 30 , only 5 were able to offer knowledge in terms of the recommendations they made . #% The EU record on upholding fundamental rights , already fragile , is at risk and needs to improve radically . #% The introduction of a common range of penalties in particular is worrying . #% I would like to add : humanity , respect for human rights and equality before the law . #% The Commission should not aid it in this secrecy or become complicit in it . #% It is an arbitrary procedure . #% Amongst those freedoms , the freedom of movement of people is perhaps the most important . #% We are not there to do that . #% How long will we continue to pile cost , liability , uncertainty and vast bureaucratic burdens on employers , making European economies less profitable and less competitive ? #% It could also devalue some categories such as young bulls , as supermarkets rationalise the categories they stock . #% We would argue strongly for consistency . #% I abstained on the final vote on this report on the basis of my speech on Wednesday evening . #% We have to take tougher action . #% Last year this House approved a resolution which drew attention to serious human rights abuses , despite the fact that Yemen has agreed to some human rights conventions and incorporated them into its laws . #% in writing . - I abstained on this report as a response to our Christian Democrat and Conservative colleagues blocking the oral amendment that would have made it clear that a right to education extends to all migrant children whether or not their parents are in the Union legally or not . #% Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has rejected the proposals and called for a ` no ' vote by the Greek Cypriot community . #% It is almost impossible to monitor and call to account the movement of radioactive material . #% I know this is a difficult dossier which all of us would like to see resolved some way or another . #% As we have heard , complaints concerning environmental assessments on the Newbury Bypass and the M40 , both in my own country , the United Kingdom , led the Ombudsman to believe that the Commission was failing in certain ways and that it was more appropriate for a general examination of the procedural position of individual complainants in the Article 169 procedure to be looked at , and also , his owninitiative enquiry arising from complaints to promote public access to documents held by Community institutions . #% Mr President , I welcome the prospect of Croatia 's accession , not only in itself , but also , as Commissioner Verheugen said , as a practical demonstration of the EU 's commitment to the eventual accession of other Balkan countries . #% Madam President , Winston Churchill once spoke of an iron curtain coming down over Europe . #% The report is a clear indication that Iraq is in breach of Resolution 1441 , it is not fully cooperating with the inspectors , nor is it coming clean . #% Evidence , indeed , of the law of unintended consequences . #% It is absolutely necessary that we do this . #% The United Kingdom Independence Party supports the EDD and rejects the dangerous and unworkable scheme to create a new nation called Europe . #% My second point is about something in the explanatory statement which the rapporteur has referred to , and that is the use of the 112 number . #% Even China , this time , recognised that there are limits to national sovereignty and accepted that there should be international verification of its emissions because we are in this together : one race , one species on a single planet . #% The Commission has a Treaty responsibility to ensure that EU rules and directives are properly respected . #% Mrs Fontaine 's excellent report makes a number of important points - apart from the obvious that good projects always require more money . #% It is decentralized civil society organizations within developing countries which have the ability to adapt cooperation policy to local conditions . #% This is a real vote of confidence that the ECB will continue to deliver price stability and will not allow an inflationary erosion of people ' s savings . #% It is now more than 1000 days into the Intifada and 3000 people have lost their lives . #% Madam President , I merely wish to correct something Commissioner Monti said . #% This report and the Commission communication to which it responds makes two major contributions to progress in seeking to reduce sexual exploitation of children through so-called sex tourism . #% Now is the time to set criteria which not only deal with the technical aspects of the Schengen system , but assess the impact of organised crime and corruption , also within the assessment of existing Schengen Member States , and I would like to see Europol and Eurojust involved in those assessments . #% The Commission has made a brave attempt to put something on paper , limited in scope though it is , to help the consumer . #% We look forward to working with her . #% 
One matter surprised me a little , although I will read his reply in detail to study it , and this is the police unit set up within the Council . #% It is not and was not . #% As a group we are also very keen that we should learn the lessons from Seattle and not use the launch of the round , or the text for the launch of the round , to somehow foreshadow or preclude the conclusion of the round . #% Second , it is clear that nickel-cadmium batteries only contribute between 1 % and 3 % of cadmium in the environment compared to 27 % from fertilizers . #% Concerning data sharing , for example , the compromise provides far too many loopholes . #% Our role now is to develop and deliver this as a matter of urgency , even though , as usual , the Member States are back to their old habits of dragging their feet on this much-needed project . #% That is something that we both regret . #% Madam President , I will confine my remarks purely to the issue of the opt-out . #% As usual , EU legislation adds expensive costs to industry which disproportionately affects SMEs and therefore favours the big players . #% In Egypt homosexuals are being entrapped on the Internet and incarcerated for no other reason but that they are homosexual : this is appalling . #% He has been fully briefed about the level of fraud and corruption here and is now fully acquainted with much of the detail published last month in . #% Mr President , is it your wish that certain Members of this House be regarded as second-class citizens or not ? #% We must try to address that question , or at least get the Council to address it . #% By the end of this year the Commission will be in a position to adopt finalised decisions on all issues that do not require changes to the Staff Regulations and also to present a formal proposal for a revised set of Staff Regulations to the interinstitutional Staff Regulations Committee . #% As a strong friend of Armenia , I am glad that the final version of the report is more balanced than the initial ones . #% I would like to add my thanks to those already expressed to Mr Bourlanges for the support he has shown to the Culture Committee . #% It represents a challenge to those Prime Ministers who prefer to opine on the fringes of the Convention but who seem far too frightened to contribute official proposals . #% We must monitor flocks on the flight paths of wild birds . #% In that pragmatic sense we already have a European constitution , not a very good one , but we have it and we should improve it further . #% I am also against Amendment Nos 2 and 43 concerning payment of unemployment benefits , both of which only just scraped through in committee . #% Where , for instance , Russia could possibly turn off our gas supply at any time , I think we have to look to alternatives . #% Mr President , may I start by thanking the Commissioner for his wise and thoughtful comments in introducing this debate and , in particular , for putting the main emphasis on people , because that is central to the subject we are discussing . #% It has been a tortuous process this particular year for everyone concerned , especially the rapporteurs , Mr Bourlanges , Mr Virrankoski and Mr Colom i Naval - because of the agreements with the Council . #% The Commissioner knows that there has been a certain exasperation over some of the committees that have been set up and the discussions that have been held about consumer protection , not just in this institution but elsewhere too . #% We know that , whatever the safeguards on paper , these do not always apply in practice . #% We must not induce , however unintentionally , any more closures in that vital area . #% Already , our failure to join the Single Currency area is costing us billions in inward investment and tens of thousands of jobs . #% The problem is that the cost in real terms of overvaluing the policies meant that Equitable Life paid out nearly GBP 6 billion more than it earned between 1997 and 2000 . #% One has some misgivings there about the rationale for what we have done ; but equally the Commission was probably uneasy to some degree about the fact that we have extended into the codecision procedure any further consideration of the exemptions for the UK , Sweden and Ireland , which will follow after five years . #% The fact is that we are dealing here with added animal fat - a quite different matter . #% I am disappointed that this report did not make origin labelling compulsory for textile products , but I am encouraged that the Commission will come forward with an assessment report to address such issues in the future . #% Although the common position places firm controls on permitted emissions from waste incinerators , I know that whenever proposals to build such an incinerator are made in my country , people rise in protest , they distrust the operator 's claims and I have a degree of sympathy with them . #% Maybe the Commissioner has some news for us today . #% Any amendment could potentially be a wrecking amendment in this situation . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to welcome this report and to thank my colleague , Mrs Roithová , for her outstanding work , and the shadow rapporteurs , who are here as well . #% That is , of course , if the Member States have the will to do so . #% Mr President , you recognize of course , just as the Commission does , that what we are dealing with here is one of the most barbaric regimes in the world ; a regime which relies upon child labour , forced labour and slave labour for its very existence . #% We must understand that those reforms brought in by Governor Patten now have broad support . #% As regards the race directive , the government has refused to give protection against discrimination based on colour , claiming the ban on discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin does not extend to colour . #% There have been significant regroupings of Taliban and al-Qa ` ida forces bent on murdering international aid workers in the provinces , which will set back progress . #% I acknowledge the Commission 's role in this and hope that the Commissioner at that time will show the same commitment as that shown by Mrs Diamantopoulou . #% Could I also say to colleagues that this is part of the compromise package we discussed . #% Commissioner , you need alliances in Johannesburg . #% Mr President , I was privileged to be part of the European Parliament 's delegation in Tunis . #% The important thing is to make sure we get to Copenhagen as a finishing line , not just another stage on our route to the successful completion of enlargement . #% In that context I would like strongly to congratulate the Belgian presidency on brokering such a successful deal on the setting up of the convention . #% Brian Simpson , who is responsible for this debate , is a member of the Labour Party . #% Why , then , is Russia tolerated as a member of the Council of Europe ? #% It is a priority for us all that the Constitution should enter into force . #% But a terrorist is not the same , for instance , as a burglar , and must be handled differently . #% The report to Parliament introduces improvements in some areas but perhaps left some issues needing clarification . #% Secondly , it would be interesting to hear how the Commission thinks other countries could be encouraged to participate in the Kyoto process . #% It is a mark of a civilised society how it treats its animals . #% To turn to Mrs Ahern 's report , I welcome Amendment No 1 , which refers to the use of new technology to apply to the ombudsman . #% As she said , it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years . #% That debate is being held in committee , and it would be premature to resolve those issues today . #% There have been serious breaches in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland . #% For the first time in my parliamentary career I can honestly say I am looking forward to working with the Committee on Budgets on this year 's budget . #% In my view , the Commission proposal with our amendments can be the basis for a solution to the comitology problem that is compatible both with the current treaty and with what is likely to come out of the European Convention . #% Saddam has used these weapons before , as we have heard , both against his own people and Iran . #% I hope at least that , in the Commissioner 's new role , she will , over the next five years , at least have the opportunity to communicate a message of success . #% Having said that , ultimately it is clear that Milosevic himself will only understand the threat of force . #% Figures for this female disease are much the same as when I raised this matter in the House last year : up to 14 million women in Europe affected , up to EUR 30 billion in costs to the EU economy for lost days at work . #% Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this , not only in Britain but indeed in most EU Member States . #% The report is thoughtful and well-considered . #% Finally , can he tell us is he shares our belief that development is the best form of conflict prevention and to commit himself to enhancing the EU 's development programme to avoid the need for crisis intervention in future years . #% 
But this resolution offers some hope that relations can improve over time , and for that reason I voted to support it . #% I hope that the Commissioner-designate will go forward with our confidence but also with the understanding that your success also reflects our own success . #% The question is why should we have a paragraph on the satellite agencies again . #% That , of course , is absolutely true , especially since the studies done under the general framework of the Commission 's interest in trans-European networks have demonstrated that when the international social economic product is taken into account , the returns on infrastructure investment are substantially greater than when only the national social economic consequences are taken into account . #% Does the Commission now have a timetable for that review and any idea of the scope ? #% There has been a troika visit to Burma . #% Asking the British trucker to give up his sausage and eggs is like inviting the Pope to a disco - it simply makes us look absurd . #% We call on the Burmese Government to permit the UN special rapporteur on Burma to visit the country freely , and to allow him to carry out his mandate by guaranteeing him full access to the regions inhabited by the Karen people . #% Let me reiterate the philosophy of two of my predecessors : Mr von der Vring and Mr Samland . #% This is somewhat disingenuous . #% Mr President , the ELDR Group welcomes the proposals that the Commission has brought forward . #% As the United Nations Special Representative said , if you are trying to introduce western-style democracy in Afghanistan , you are wasting your time . #% That has been done by individuals who have opted me in to the lists held by the spammers . #% Eventually the Commissioner agreed to act and in 2008 , as Liz has said , did draft an amendment to the 2000 directive , but then HOSPEEM and EPSU , the public service unions , signalled their desire to formulate an agreement . #% I hope it is a step closer to getting the moratorium lifted so that we can start to approve new GM products which will be of benefit to all and utilise the new legislation , of which I was the author last year . #% Mr President , I think that as Mr Kellett-Bowman might well attest , in the budget arrangements for 1999 we put in a series of amendments to ensure that the Commission actually tops up on the third or fourth payments every year the losses made by any agency through exchange rate fluctuations or the weighting arrangements . #% Madam President , I think back to this time last year and I wonder , if we had had this debate in February 1996 , whether there would have been quite such a consensus in favour of the Commission proposals and in favour of the Mayer report . #% These are shifting sands . #% To that end we have previously had action plans from the Commission on how it can use its instruments to support that process . #% We have to have a structure whereby national regulatory authorities must work together . #% Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy . #% I agree with that point . #% In my view , to delay accession by one year would bring no real benefit to the European Union , Romania or Bulgaria or to their electorates , as one year is not a significant timeframe in accession terms and no significant reforms at all could be expected in such a short twelve months . #% The UK Government is in favour of harmonising qualifications . #% Water ought to be one of the topmost priorities . #% I strongly urge the House to show its support for the protection of young people in Britain and to vote in favour of this report . #% I have only just arrived in the Parliament because of delays . #% Therefore , in line with the E-commerce Directive , we have asked for a two-year review . #% I therefore support this resolution . #% In important ways , therefore , efficiency is the enemy of democracy . #% This is a toxic mix and I ask you to look at the contrasts and contradictions in this area . #% Amendments to ensure the principles of development underpin our relations with all Latin American countries highlighting the very severe social impact of the structural adjustment policies , supporting far greater involvement of civil society in our dialogue and agreements as well as the sensitive question of fair trade access for products of the countries own choosing , not ours . #% It is right to draw this to the attention of people . #% I shall respond to them all . #% So any criticism can only apply to next year . #% Europe , which has done so much in terms both of humanitarian aid to Lebanon and in evacuating innocent people and committing peacekeeping troops , must now relentlessly pursue that political dialogue . #% It is troubling that a large proportion of children in care or in institutions in Bulgaria come from the Roma community . #% For this reason , and with reservations as above , I have voted against the report . #% What are the real risks , in particular the risk of absorption when we use these products ; and what are the risks of alternative products ? #% What is Israel expected to do when it is surrounded by countries who do not even , to this day , accept its right to exist ? #% The future of the ECSC operating budget is not without controversy or complications . #% . Mr President , I want to start with a word of praise for the Commission . #% I warmly welcome this approach , and in particular the setting-up of a dedicated police task force , Usig , to bring those in authority who have ordered human rights violations to eventual justice . #% Many of my colleagues - I hope all my colleagues - feel that we are dealing with a very unsatisfactory situation . #% One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges . #% Mr President , Iraq today belongs to the Iraqi people . #% I agree with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that the conference can be described as a qualified success . #% Whilst a superficially attractive proposition , many of us were right not to be taken in as this has proved a false prospectus . #% Pensioners across Europe have reason to be grateful to him for the work he has done . #% Let me remind you of some of the interventions in the Doha plenary debate . #% Another milestone was agreement earlier this year on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities , for which I was Parliament 's rapporteur . #% This will apply to all the other reports on this item and will save me from constantly getting up . #% Why is there such a legal obligation ? #% But nevertheless , no one can under-estimate the challenges it poses in terms of Turkey 's absorption into the EU , with its very large population and hence the political influence it will gain by joining the EU , its relative poverty and therefore demands on the structural funds , as well as its distinct and separate cultural and religious identity . #% We warned even the Commission against putting forward its quite reasonable proposals , on the grounds that if you start to undo one bit of the draft Constitution , then another bit will unravel and that will be the excuse for somebody else to come up with another proposal , and so on . #% We welcome the human rights dialogue with China and Iran . #% And , to that end , I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation , or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity , particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security . #% At the same time we support the rapporteur 's own amendment , Amendment No 5 , which deplores the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deplores the development of national missile defence , which we believe will trigger a new arms race in East Asia . #% This House should speak with one clear voice , pointing out that the needs and the rights of the disabled are above party politics : they matter to us all . #% Before any food safety agency is set up , the Commission must examine all these cases in France as well . #% It rightly calls for the European Union to press for a global code of conduct on ethical recruitment . #% Those are the central elements in the report . #% I am confident it will . #% With its report , Parliament has responded thoroughly , responsibly and with vision to help establish a sound framework for progress . #% We must have the full and fair implementation of the Copenhagen criteria in political and economic matters . #% Like him , we believe in a vibrant maritime industry for the whole of Europe . #% 
So the whole system has to be refreshed , renewed and looked at , as the Council has said . #% So I hope the Commission will take into account some of these amendments . #% The Commission supports the creation of a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo and deeply regrets the continuing ethnic violence . #% It sounds great at this stage , but let us not forget that this has not been an easy process for Parliament . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , to make a personal statement , I spent a lot of time with Salmaan Taseer when we were both in our twenties . #% This is obviously an issue we need to address extremely rapidly . #% Perhaps I should begin where I left off in this Chamber in June when I offered an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group 's abstention and my own national delegation 's vote against the then resolution . #% For example , last October the Deutsche Bank estimated that contracts concerning new oil fields in Iraq , worth USD 38 billion , were signed with oil companies mainly from China , France and Russia . #% A longer-term programme will ensure young people have the opportunity to benefit from such schemes for a guaranteed time . #% I hope that the theme of your strategy on the internal market will be that consumers and enterprises will get a better deal from the internal market and you will bring in provisions during your term of office to make sure that we really achieve that essential goal . #% In the light of the European Mediterranean Partnership that we have , we speak as friends of Egypt , because indeed Egypt today is still one of the foremost defenders of democratic rights and guarantees of democracy and human freedoms in the entire Arab world . #% Why are we using public money to support people to grow potatoes to make into starch that we can not use in the EU ? #% Mr President , every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships . #% Mr Corbett , I shall probably borrow your wording for a pamphlet in my constituency , but this is in a common good cause . #% I should first like to congratulate Mrs Wemheuer on her excellent report . #% As well as that , would the Council not agree that the real solution to stop all these sorts of acts - and there have been many deaths in Kashmir over the years - would be to grant the people their self-determination ? #% We recognize that the Commission will be coming forward soon with a new proposal with regard to comitology and the development of the modus vivendi . #% If Japan is prepared to go ahead , then there is the suspicion that the Japanese may want to re-write the crucial proposals within the protocol , notably using the year 2000 perhaps rather than 1990 as the base year for calculating greenhouse gas emission reductions . #% If so , or if not , when does that opportunity disappear ? #% Mr Barroso is a rampant free marketeer , according to the people over there , while his ideas went out with the Ark according to Mr Mandelson , from the right . #% It would be a gross mistake and an intrusion into an area of uniquely national competence to try and ban such recruitment . #% . -- Mr President , as well as questioning the legitimacy of the EU entering into the International Dolphin Conservation Programme instead of individual States , I would also question whether the EU can be trusted to make the right judgment . #% When the OLAF investigation into CDE found that corruption had taken place and that the Commission had failed to exercise due diligence as members of the management board of the CDE at the time the fraud was taking place , one would have expected action and certainly protection for the whistleblowers concerned . #% I would be grateful if you could convey to the President that I have discussed this issue with Mrs Kinnock who also wishes to express her concern . #% In the conclusions of the Council relating to the Convention , one paragraph is devoted to the forum and it seems to be more about informing the network of organisations than having their contributions in the work of the Convention . #% We still do not have a full understanding of the causes of MS and we should not rest until this problem is solved . #% Do you not know that for some species the annual weight of useless discards is as much as the weight of the fish legally landed ? #% I thank Mr Collins for his excellent report and hope that his common sense approach will be adopted by Parliament . #% It is only right that we try to promote this around the globe . #% In my constituency in the north-east of England , there are Zimbabweans who fear summary death if they are forced to return to their native land . #% We are Nationalists , valuing the sovereignty of the nation state . #% I am trying to get a better understanding between the cofinancing for the international networks and the co-financing at Member State initiative level . #% It happens time and again . #% This , of course , will aid not only the internal market , but also free movement of people and labour within the EU . #% However , I also understand that the letter says it is not a matter for this House . #% That remains the fundamental problem which faces Europe . #% Would the Commissioner agree with me that the TRIPs is neutral on parallel imports and actually allows for compulsory licensing ? #% However , given China 's attitude towards Taiwan , Tibet and its own dissenters -- ranging from the peaceful practitioners of Falun Gong to the pro-democracy activists who were imprisoned so brutally after Tiananmen Square -- I support maintaining the EU arms embargo . #% I want to make it clear in your voting list , colleagues , that the first part of Amendment No 15 is part of the compromise text and I am recommending you vote against the second part . #% That report went on to say : `` We see it as logical to use the capabilities of ESA also for the development of more security-orientated aspects of European space policy . '' #% What level of deterioration in the situation will trigger these sanctions ? #% Finally , on a different note , I congratulate Prime Minister Berlusconi on securing for historic and gastronomic Parma the seat of the Food Safety Agency . #% Now it wants more money to spend on yet another ambitious and seriously misguided project . #% I was interested that the budget blood still runs in the Commissioner 's veins . #% Although some within the pharmaceutical sector protest at the very thought that there might be any risk of that , it seems reasonable to myself and many others that the use of public resources and legal support should be absolutely transparent . #% They seriously question the nature and direction of the EU project . #% We are increasingly concerned that ever-spiralling levels of tax on cigarettes may lead to increased smuggling . #% I have not been to Nicaragua but Christine Oddy has and she has reported faithfully what she saw . #% It is essential to stress with maximum emphasis that a clear distinction must be made between the costs of meeting the Commission 's carefully measured request for 717 new posts including 118 posts in Delegations , submitted in the amending letter last September , and the far smaller gross costs of investing in reform . #% This debate has shown that there is much support and much appetite in this House for reform , in this lively exchange we are having in the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of this debate . #% I see no reason why these should be abolished . #% If we are lucky , we will see a world approach to outlaw these very bad practices . #% This committee takes less than 1 % of the EU budget , but I would not want anyone to think that we should see education , culture , media and information as optional extras . #% The Commission has set out some useful lines of discussion and debate looking ahead post-2004 . #% This can not be allowed to go ahead and every effort must be made to ensure that it is prevented . #% I am generally in favour of free movement but I think it needs to be limited . #% For example , the British Technology Group employs just 182 people and has a turnover of EUR 22 million and a balance sheet of EUR 32 million . #% As of today , the prisoners have still , regrettably , not been released . #% We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded . #% We regret the continuing emphasis on economic growth without regard to the quality and effect of that growth . #% I certainly have never been asked whether that is what I want . #% As for Category 2 , we may have the commitment on commitment appropriations but we certainly do not have the same understanding when it comes to payments . #% The second and perhaps bigger challenge is that of the new technologies , the advent of e-commerce . #% It might become contagious in this House and we might adopt a resolution and then consider voting again because we have reached the wrong conclusions . #% Faced with the enormity of problems concerning the environment , she once said that we can not cry about everything all the time . #% The government of Chad needs to reassure public opinion in Chad and throughout the world by holding an independent and a public inquiry into the allegations that have been made . #% 
I am glad about that because the early drafts I have seen of the Kok report would be an inappropriate conclusion for a mid-term review as the balance is wrong . #% That was the reason for abstention . #% Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained . #% There is a point which has already been made by many other speakers : there has not been an independent study , and we need one . #% We propose to give the Commission the right simply to withdraw an implementing measure if Parliament objects to it or indeed if the Council objects to it . #% Police and the military have destroyed ten houses of Catholics in Quang Ngai Province . #% We supported calls for moves to ensure free and fair elections and we also supported the calls from civil society for revised and updated electoral registers to ensure that maximum participation would be possible within those elections . #% He is clearly an exceptionally talented , able and intelligent central banker . #% . Mr President , Mr Juncker 's speech was made with all the passion that a civil servant is likely to raise . #% I sat in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom for 18 years before coming into this Chamber . #% Now that Africa makes that political decision , hopefully it too can move ahead . #% I particularly welcome the fact that Mr Collins has devoted a clear section in his report to health and I strongly support his calls for the airlines to be far more proactive in giving information about health risks . #% Finally , a word on INTERREG . #% The extension of inspection by ancillary staff in the case of red meat causes us special concern . #% The first is on paragraph 1 where we mention the need for a Members ' statute and an assistants ' statute . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I believe that Alejo Vidal-Quadras , a good friend of mine , and others who have spoken are profoundly mistaken and that we should support the amendments , because the Iraqi Government has announced on more than one occasion recently that it has no intention whatsoever of forcing the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf to leave for Iran or to go to any other country . #% Finally , would he give a view on how , in view of the very tight timescale until the end of June this year and the fact that we have European Parliament elections in the intervening period , the Council and the Commission will be consulting this Parliament on their proposals - which we hope will be forthcoming from ECOFIN or from Berlin - on a extension to the duty-free regime ? #% It would be very wrong if a report dealing with disabled people 's rights were put back to Thursday afternoon when most of the Members are not here and most of the Members will not be here to vote . #% Mr President , this legislation has often been referred to as the lawnmowers directive . #% There are few Russians who do not see a connection between Gusinsky 's criticisms and the heavy-handed treatment now being meted out to him . #% We are deeply concerned that there should be a field of safety and of common practices throughout the European Union in the matter of blood products and their safety . #% In addition and crucially , Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees . #% It is very dangerous . #% Madam President , I am informed by the British Foreign Office there is a factual error in Recital M. I would therefore like to propose an oral amendment to which I have the agreement of Mr Dupuis and Mr McMillanScott , to say : ' welcoming the announcement by Chinese authorities that they will sign the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights and are studying the possibility of signing the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ' . #% Whilst I appreciate that MEPs are amongst the worst culprits for excessive cabin baggage , I would hope their sense of responsibility would enable them to recognise that a problem exists , that this problem compromises safety and that Amendment No 16 should be supported . #% Mr President , may I first of all welcome the Secretary of State and thank her for her excellent overview and also , of course , thank Michel Rocard for his report . #% That is not a record to be proud of and not something I am prepared to stand before my constituents and say . #% I certainly would agree with everything he has said so far . #% My final point is addressed to the Commissioner : for those who have food , there are many problems ; for those who do not , there is only one . #% In 1993 , the Commission admitted that the laws on animal transport were being systematically flouted . #% I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way , into squalid and unfit jails , not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme , but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created . #% I have the honour to represent an area in the north-west of England , Blackpool and Fylde which is very dependent on tourism . #% Madam President , on the Nicholson report , I voted against it because paragraph 20 seeks to delay the completion of the second nuclear reactor at Cernavoda . #% Therefore I would commend to the Commission the majority of my colleagues ' amendments which extend , clarify and develop the proposals of the Commission in a direction which is worthwhile and , in particular , the amendments which extend the provision of information through safety data sheets . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Fontaine and colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights for their considered and intelligent discussion of this topic . #% It is being used for geopolitical engineering purposes , apparently under the guidance of the intelligence services . #% We need to make certain that small producers can come forward and be reassured that it will not be a costly and prohibitive process . #% We need to have PSAPs upgraded to deal with this . #% In the last couple of years the citizens of the European Union ... #% I strongly support measures to protect those who work in the cultural industries by protecting intellectual property . #% Let us remind ourselves that , in the last six months , 80 % of Portugal 's debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank . #% The only way to deliver on this is to vote against the Commission as a whole . #% What we have got to recognize is that either we must get stuck into this approach , as we are doing at the moment , or else we will fall well behind the Americans . #% We called for that in our resolution and we regret that it clearly is not going to happen . #% I am therefore proposing that the debate should resume at 4.45 p.m. today , and I would ask 32 Members to support this . #% This was a most disturbing report and I will send it to your services . #% As members will be aware , the UK Government was party to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council . #% We need to look at that as well as to consider the future role of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions , especially with the development of competences in the field of justice and home affairs and also with enlargement . #% Mr President , with your permission and pursuant to Rule 141 ( 4 ) , I give way to my colleague , Mr Helmer , to put a question to me . #% I think the Commission should look at this . #% How many times , Commissioner , do we have to listen to Aung Sang Suu Kyi , the democratic leader of Burma , ask the international community and tell the international community that only isolation and only sanctions will affect the SLORC . #% It is time not for defeatist language but for constructive and practical answers . #% As far as the contents of the Rothley report are concerned , we British Conservatives have deep reservations about some of them . #% It would be a counterproductive political gesture which would cause more economic harm to Europe than Israel because of the balance of trade that exists . #% We also know that it would lead to a disproportionate burden on small businesses . #% The Kissinger question of who to call in Europe has not really been answered , has it ? #% The debate , therefore , should and must reflect the need to assess the impact of these reforms on the EU 's declared poverty eradication objectives and our sustainable development objectives for the world 's poorest countries . #% So , Commissioner , we look to you to be firm , fix these problems and come forward with solutions for SEPA direct debits by 30 September 2010 . #% Mrs Delmas-Marty is the former head of the supervisory body of OLAF and she has written many books on this particular subject . #% Mr President , I will start by declaring an interest , because I have been a Class 1 football referee for 18 years now and I am attached to the English FA , and also by congratulating both France for winning the Euro 2000 championship in such a fantastic way , and alas , begrudgingly Germany for winning the World Cup bid for 2006 . #% We can also claim credit for slimming down the original proposal and giving it more focus . #% In this Chamber , it asked to be judged on its record over the six months it was in office . #% It says the President may have a round of catch-the-eye . #% I am quite sure that this is where the sticking-point actually lies - in the compulsory element . #% Madam President , it would be wrong if our votes were determined on the basis of faulty equipment . #% As far as the overwhelming majority of its citizens are concerned , the European Union is not , and should not be , a political state . #% 
What on earth does it have to hide ? #% The European Council , under the Presidency of the United Kingdom , must maximise its special relationship with the US to make joint efforts to add to the existing ties with other Muslim countries , such as Egypt , Jordan and Turkey , to name but a few . #% However , the critics will continue to remind us that more new settlements have been built this year on the West Bank than were evacuated in the last month , that 8 000 settlers are left but more than 240 000 still remain . #% We need to be absolutely clear on the status and treatment of people who are excluded from international procedure , but who are non-removable from EU territory owing to any of the different reasons which may lead to this status . #% When Mrs Kinnock , Mr Thomas and I were in the Windward Islands in May it was quite obvious that the producers there were living in fear - and I mean fear - of the WTO ruling . #% I want to make the point here that this is a reference and not an attempt to harmonise taxation across the European Union . #% I would ask the Council what steps it is taking to achieve that . #% Everyone should of course be mindful of the fact that the Russian authorities are responsible for repaying the principal and the interest due on such assistance . #% The micro aspect covers minimum standards for the auditing exercise . #% It is slightly disappointing therefore to find him back here at the following part-session adopting such a cautious approach on such a fundamental single market issue . #% It is an urgency which has been voted by this Parliament - so be it , but it is quite ludicrous . #% I could bore you with them but they are all contained within the explanatory statement of the report and in the Commission report itself . #% I say to this House that it has to understand that what Israel has suffered these past months , the murder of 418 innocent men , women and children , is almost too much for any democratic state to have to bear . #% My argument , therefore , is that -- as has been agreed by the PPE-DE Group -- we should maintain the human rights debate on Zimbabwe , where there is an appalling humanitarian situation under Mr Mugabe , and we should have a full debate on Transnistria at the next plenary part-session . #% My specific question to you , Commissioner , is would the Commission advocate sporting bans at this time or not ? #% The population of Darfur still faces the prospect of so-called security being provided solely by the Sudanese Government , with no international protection . #% It is about ensuring adequate generation capacity , an adequate balance between supply and demand and appropriate levels of interconnection . #% I would finish by returning to a remark by Mr Falconer who implied that this was an institutional question and not a political question , or something along those lines . #% On lines B7-611 , 851 and 852 , where sums in the region of ECU 11.5 million remain unused , what will happen to those amounts of money ? #% If you look at the Irish economy , Prime Minister , you will see that in your own economy the role of public investment has been absolutely crucial in getting the sort of growth rates that you have had in recent years . #% Action by the EU to control the proliferation of small arms in fragile states is undermined by our role as major arms exporters . #% I would like to know whether the Commissioner agrees with my assessment that if the EU substantially enhances its preference system , it could meet the requirements of the improved GSP option , the EPA alternative , which some non-LDCs are continuing to call for , as the Commissioner is well aware . #% I would certainly urge that a representative - the chairman of the Petitions Committee - should be on the Interinstitutional Committee so that citizens know that the Members of this Parliament who look after their interests ensure that this secrecy does not go any deeper than it does at present . #% We hear about many deaths , but too many go unreported . #% All three institutions are bound by that agreement and that is what should govern this situation . #% Prime Minister , I know this is a European not a Finnish project , but you are particularly well placed with your former President , Mr Ahtisaari , involved in the status talks on Kosovo and your former assistant , Olli Rehn , as the Commissioner for Enlargement . #% That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively . #% What , incidentally , are the Commission 's new proposals on controls ? #% I know that you are sending the national allocation plans back to the Member States and saying that a 15 % margin between allocations and real CO2 emissions is far from good enough . #% Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital . #% I would like some clarification from the Chair , because according to the Guardian newspaper today , John Stevens and Brendan Donnelly , members of the Conservative Group opposite , were expelled and then later reinstated by the Tory Party ; they later resigned and then , after a hasty compromise , were persuaded to stay . #% Finally , I fear that bananas and sugar will be well and truly on the agenda in Hong Kong as far as the ACP countries are concerned . #% Does the presidency agree that Kashmir is a good example of a conflict allowed to fester for too long ? #% It is not only that he is prepared to implement his reactionary prejudices against women and gay people in public policy -- and what signal is he sending to his eight female colleagues ? -- he also has a very poor record on asylum and immigration , security and the rule of law . #% The inability to deal with the big states , most notably Croatia , and President Tudjman 's activities , particularly in relation to the Croat community in Mostar and the inability also to deal with what I suspect are the real villains behind the situation in Mostar , that is the gangsters on West Bank who have clearly got the city tied up for themselves and do not want normal peace to be resumed . #% We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue . #% If we are going to Nice to ask for more powers for this Parliament it is hardly a good precedent for us to send the whole Parliament off for four weeks , away from the place where they are elected to do their duty . #% It is great to see the Commissioner here and I would like to thank her and her staff for the help they have given me while compiling this report . #% Far too many of our citizens are economically inactive , and therefore we should be putting investment into active labour market policies that enable people to get back to work and then policies that support people in order for them to be able to continue in work . #% Today his life is our story . #% In addition to repressive measures , it is fundamental that we look at and try to address the root causes - poverty , war , oppression and a whole range of issues - that lead to terrorism . #% All of us are suffering because fuel prices have gone up . #% It is because of the failure of the common fisheries policy that we are having to provide this money . #% As regards efficiency , the Commission has made it very clear that we are deeply dissatisfied with the fact that the original deadline was not respected and , even more importantly , that it has changed on numerous occasions . #% We need some form of European-wide action on this issue . #% We must ensure the good functioning of the Union for our citizens present and future . #% The Commission is no exception and the fact that the general quality of staff is high is evident in the continuing essential policy performance of the Commission . #% I have apologised to you , Commissioner , because I can not stay . #% I believe that farmers throughout Europe will welcome these recommendations as uncertainty is their greatest problem in an area where long term planning is absolutely essential . #% The Commission is very good at developing new ideas but less good at managing these ideas once they are up and running . #% I suggest he would have published a book with pictures of MEPs who monkey with British postal traditions entitled ` Stanley Stamps Gibbon Catalogue ' . #% Let us not forget that this follows hard on the heels of the protracted and frequently bitter negotiations of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement where the EU acted very dismally indeed . #% Will he promise that the Council will at least keep the impact of the Charter closely under scrutiny and review its status on a continuing basis ? #% Mr President , I am speaking specifically about the Turco reports . #% We have at the moment a situation unparalleled perhaps in our continent over the past 200 years where we can stabilize the security and democracy of Central and Eastern Europe . #% In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to accept Parliament 's amendments and utilize them to improve the text ; to ensure that progress in this area takes place in the atmosphere of public trust and confidence which is necessary if the industry is to prosper . #% This must be the reason why corruption in the area of international adoptions has continually been circumvented by special adoption commissions . #% Secondly , where trade is across national borders it wants protection from exchange rate variations to improve trade . #% If the budget goes through the first reading in early December , that will actually be operational . #% We in Parliament have tied our hands somewhat in not making full use of the possibility of using substitute Members in the Conciliation Committee . #% People were particularly grateful to have the opportunity to submit their comments to the committee members in person . #% Nevertheless , in Nigeria we have the terrible spectacle of women being executed for simple adultery by a barbarically slow and painful method . #% Our task , as Members of the European Parliament , is to deliver an informed political verdict on this crucial election at the Brussels part-session later this month . #% We agree with the actions in the six priority areas , but a large majority of the respondents of the Commission 's own consultation said that it was necessary to fix an end date in order to incentivise the reluctant . #% It has become a tragic fact of life in India as well , not just in Kashmir but in Mumbai where 200 people were murdered in July and in Malegaon on 8 September 2006 , where some 40 people were killed . #% The policy of ramassage has been a great success for this Parliament . #% 
It has recently negotiated and ratified extradition treaties with both Serbia and Croatia in the fight against organised crime . #% This is a very disturbing statistic which has also been referred to by other speakers . #% Finally , I am happy to send the Commissioner documentation from a major mobile phone trader in my region . #% There are three priorities for the Council at the moment : action , action and action . #% Lord Plumb feels that there is little point in this resolution before the House today . #% We are particularly interested in the proposals on monitoring mechanisms , which are likely to come forward soon . #% Unlike the Minister , I now want to concentrate on Mr Blair 's increasingly frantic attempts to get an agreement on the financial perspectives and the future EU budget . #% I have to say , Commissioner , I was rather disappointed by your response to them . #% Mr President , in 1999 Commissioner Kinnock was given the task of cleaning up the Commission 's accounting and eliminating fraud . #% According to my calculation , unless there are new members of the Conservative Party , the proportion of Members from our side and their side are almost the same . #% This report and the Stability and Growth Pact in the convergent programmes are clear evidence of the link between tax-and-spend policies and monetary policy . #% For this reason , my group does not wish to see any opening of the revision of the Financial Perspective over the next 12 months . #% Where do we go from our new position ? #% In paragraph 9 , the resolution stresses Member States ' competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies . #% The disputes between us will be about costs and time-scales , and perhaps also about the accuracy of the Commission 's methodology and the achievability of the targets it has set in this directive . #% Madam President , I would also like to add my voice to the condolences that have already been expressed in this House following the unspeakable happenings in Spain this morning . #% On such an important subject we want to deal with the present , thereby being better able to shape the future . #% Let me remind the House of the wide range of measures that are already in hand which address our security of supply needs : both legislative measures , such as the TENs Directive , and actions by the industry in building pipelines , storage and LNG facilities . #% One condition on which my group insisted was that this culture of secrecy must change fundamentally , opening up decision-making not only to us in Parliament , but to the world outside . #% Many people in Africa feel threatened by efforts to promote homosexuality , particularly when those efforts are led by NGOs and organisations based in the west . #% For example , minors and those who have committed offences under physical duress , should clearly not be subject to the same penalties as all offenders . #% Alex Erwin , the Trade Minister , speaking this morning in Cape Town , said that the decision on Monday was extremely disappointing . #% Can we be reassured that there is some close coordination between the two ? #% Many European citizens are deeply critical of the proposed US national missile defence system , which they rightly see as an offensive system which is certain to start a new and costly international arms race . #% With enlargement , these six months will be great ones . #% However , the people who have not been involved - as is so often the case - are the people most likely to benefit or suffer from our decisions . #% But there is also a third important element : that of ensuring fair competition between the various modes of transport . #% We unanimously support in our group the Council 's decision for this case to go to the Court of Justice . #% Perhaps even worse is the effect on those who choose not to smoke , especially pregnant women and children who are forced to breathe in dangerous particles emitted from those around them who light up . #% It was also responsible for blowing up a South Korean airliner . #% If we want the single market to be truly functional and the right to work across Europe to be meaningful , a period of study or work across Europe should not just provide an opportunity to experience the way of life in another country but should be to get a tangible qualification . #% There is also the not insubstantial cost to business and individuals , who presumably would have to pay for the installation of such technology . #% I applaud the work that Mrs Peijs has done and I hope that we have finally sorted this issue out . #% We condemn guerrilla violence and whilst welcoming the release of the kidnapped 70 young conscripts earlier this year against some expectations , we express concern at reports of widespread interference in the electoral process in the run-up to local elections due on 26 October . #% Even this small step forward will cost one billion euros per year , a cost which will be ultimately borne by the consumers buying the goods which are delivered by ship . #% Of course I have tremendous sympathy for the Names who suffered these underwriting losses , among whom are a number of my friends , including the godparents of one of my own children . #% Most of the EU nationals have now been released -- certainly all nine British citizens -- but around a dozen people who have legal residence in an EU country , for instance as refugees , are still there . #% So rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British vets to carry out the work . #% Postponement would have served no useful purpose . #% That is why we need concerted action at European level : a common economic policy , particularly in the field of public investment , so that we can boost growth rates and tackle the unemployment problem . #% If anything should be brought forward very quickly in a pilot stage by Mr Busquin and his team , it is the idea of moving into the virtual centres of excellence and achieving progress in certain key areas . #% It is clear that there are real economic problems in the eurozone and I have heard nothing from Mr Trichet that would indicate his ability to solve them . #% I wish to protest that we are navel-gazing and ignoring the greatest threat to the world 's security today - a war in which millions of people could die . #% I am not very good at mathematics , but I make that 24 , so one of the Member States you told me nothing about at all . #% People do not want politicians to protect them from sunlight ; increasingly , people simply want to be protected from politicians . #% I said that this conveyed a pathetic image of the EU . #% In this House we must end the interinstitutional argument and act collectively with the Commission and the Council to achieve agreement , with checks and balances on data retention , the use of biometrics , passenger name records , Schengen Information System II , VIS , police and intelligence cooperation . #% If you have more than three priorities , as Bob Zoellick , the USTR , said , you lose yourself in detail and you can never focus on what is really important . #% That certainly is the view of my dog , which is the proud owner of two human beings ! #% I am also impressed by your assertion that you intend not to be beholden to the Member States and in particular that you do not want super-Commissioners . #% It takes resolve to get a matter on the floor of the European Parliament , and for someone suffering from the ravages of this disease , it shows outstanding strength of will . #% This is an essential safeguard . #% Mr Assange arrived in Sweden less than a month after WikiLeaks leaked the Afghanistan war logs and announced it had many more revelations to come . #% Only then will the Greek people accept they have got to make these cuts . #% Prime Minister Aznar spoke about targets for ` inter-connectiveness ' . #% Thirdly , for us more importantly , Mr Newton Dunn , the rapporteur , has taken the opportunity to introduce an amendment in pursuit of one of his pet subjects , namely the establishment of a European public security force , in other words a European gendarmerie or armed police . #% The answer is certainly ` yes ' . #% Thus , given the final outcome of the report in committee , I reiterate the necessity of our open approach - the carrot rather than the stick - designed to encourage the participation of the business community . #% The three Amsterdam leftovers will be part of the package but they will not be alone . #% Our first objective - and I support the conclusions of the Cardiff Summit - must be a cessation of hostilities to allow international observers into Kosovo to view the situation for themselves . #% As such , it is a slap in the face for all developing countries which invested so much hope in the Doha Declaration and in the objectives of the Doha development round . #% We must , of course , be sensitive about forcing our more liberal and tolerant values on others , because it can sometimes be counterproductive . #% I am sure this is going to have a resonance over the rest of Europe . #% The statement of assurance is supposed to cover ` down to the level of taxpayers ' . #% I do not criticise individual staff , but I receive too many complaints from prestigious organisations like the European Youth Orchestra , the European Youth Parliament , the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation - renowned organisations doing a wonderful job for Europe and our young people . #% To be competitive and to market their goods , there needs to be substantial investment in their ability to do so . #% 
It is also saying that this is the way to encourage - and it is encouraging - a black market in these tickets . #% The proposal , as Mr Goodwill has said , has two important aims . #% This sly and shadowy method is not a clever strategy because if the European public one day finds it does not like the system of surveillance constructed , it will react strongly . #% But what is vital is that the people across Europe have a debate about the future , a debate about political union . #% The EU action plan itself makes a strong case for a more proactive and consistent European approach in satellite communications , asserting , and rightly so , that European information technology and satellite technology lags behind the United States , first of all , in terms of the technology itself , but also because of the regulatory framework . #% We need new , additional money , and the needs of victims of other crises , such as those in Sudan , Congo , Haiti , Liberia and northern Uganda , should not be forgotten . #% Speaking in a personal capacity , I have been delighted in the last few weeks to discover that the British Conservative Party is now the champion of the rights of the European Parliament , although I regret that this has been to the detriment of their former commitment to enlargement of the European Union . #% Politicians can play an important role as intermediaries , but it is important that non-elected politicians , as you choose to be nowadays Sir Leon , are aware that it is a two-way process . #% What would be the core competences of the European public prosecutor ? #% I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal ; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density . #% In Africa , and this is a continent to which the European Union apparently attaches special importance , a very clear test case of the seriousness of our resolve is Zimbabwe . #% As Mrs McCarthy said , in terms of operation and protecting the public interest respectable operations are extremely important . #% I want to concentrate on security in the justice field . #% More precise rules on the rights and obligations of officials to report wrong-doing through internal channels and to OLAF are required , and rules defining external channels for the reporting of alleged wrong-doing need to be compiled and proposed , as they will be . #% Meanwhile that country is breaching the UN Refugee Convention by deporting migrants to Libya and preventing their access to an asylum determination procedure . #% That has now risen to the dizzy heights of 18 MEPs , to hear what is an important statement on an important subject . #% In his communication on the reform of external assistance , Mr Patten recognised , and I quote , `` acute staff shortages have had a direct and negative impact on the speediness and quality of EC aid delivery '' . #% Maastricht recognizes the significance of culture in clause 128 but for millions of Europeans sport is more important . #% I predict that the Council 's next step will be to institute Europe-wide bans . #% Mr President , this afternoon I am speaking not only on my own behalf , as I have worked closely with the rapporteur , Mrs Echerer , but also more particularly on behalf of our shadow rapporteur , Mrs Fourtou , who is sorry that she is unable to be here to share in these comments . #% This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa 's work , because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon , allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations , is often needed when dealing with such technical details like ` use it or lose it on the slot ' . #% The enlargement process is going to face us with a whole series of new problems with regard to implementation and enforcement of legislation . #% I am sure the Commissioner will confirm this . #% Our principles centre around development , and if they are not addressed , then the Council should understand that we will not give our assent until that is clearly part of the way in which you are operating . #% It is that subsidy that has caused the overcapacity that has led to the depletion of stocks . #% It is vital to ensure that we are consistent with the e-commerce directive , and a country-of-origin approach will be consistent with the e-commerce directive if we adopt it in the ISD . #% I first became engaged in the whole project of the human resources reform in the Commission at the end of 1999 when I was first appointed provisional rapporteur - and subsequently confirmed as rapporteur - for Parliament on the overall strategy . #% There is a threat and an opportunity with the introduction of the euro . #% The prospect of EU membership has already empowered modernisers and human rights defenders in Turkey to push for the necessary changes . #% We talk about the problem of unemployment , then we pass directives that destroy jobs . #% I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union . #% One of the great difficulties in establishing a network of mutual recognition is the complexity of the procedures required to put it into place and to ensure the ongoing compatibility and appropriateness of the mutual recognition network . #% By 2005 , 11 % of US retail sales will be online , only 6 + % in western Europe . #% The final point I want to make is in relation to the way in which we now have a centralized monetary policy and what we do on economic policy . #% That issue must be tackled by this IGC . #% The UK Government passed the correct legislation in good faith but then failed to make sure that it was implemented properly . #% Aung San Suu Kyi is a symbol of resistance to tyranny and personifies the hopes of the people of Burma for freedom . #% If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution , it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem . #% Mr President , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has long argued for greater consideration of social and employment standards in public procurement in two ways . #% We can all remember the old-style Western films where bandits gallop across the state border while the Sheriff 's posse has to grind to a halt on one side . #% The time has come , accordingly , for NATO and its members to act , and since European Union Member States make up over half of the 19 members of NATO , the EU has a special responsibility to promote action . #% I have witnessed many projects in my own region , such as the Tornado , Eurofighter , even Airbus and its derivatives . #% The Court of Auditors ' report says quite clearly that under Article 54 , 15 pits received subsidies . #% Where do we go ? #% Only yesterday a new report highlighted the pitiful plight of the battery hen , crammed into a cage at just 18 weeks , no room to flap its wings , not enough room to stand fully upright , not able to scratch , doze or bathe . #% Therefore it makes sense to curtail the mandate of the existing Commission and move rapidly to the approval of a new Commission by the new Parliament with the full democratic legitimacy that it entails . #% My first concern is that there is flexibility for Member States to extend the information available . #% I think perhaps I have a remedy for you . #% We must not deny the patients of the future the therapies of tomorrow . #% I am aware , as others must be , that there are now no areas in this House at all - even those that are declared non-smoking areas - which are free of smoking . #% I hinted earlier that the conventions negotiated at The Hague deserve much more attention . #% These states are extremely dependent on our benevolence . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office to comment on the second part of my question , in particular the need to incorporate binding regulatory standards , especially in the areas of labour , the environment , investment incentives and restrictive business practices in any new multilateral agreement on investment , alongside rights for investors . #% The social model is profoundly discriminatory . #% In this respect it is crucial that EU support for the electoral process is conditional : the elections must be free and fair , with opposition politicians allowed to return and participate ; with equal access to the media guaranteed for all parties who wish to participate ; with the infamous media sub-decree annulled which outrageously defines any critic of the government as a traitor ; with the displaced fugitives able to return freely to Cambodia from Thailand ; with the repatriation of Prince Norodom Ranariddh , as provided for by the Manila peace plan . #% It is clear that our programme for justice has moved from an emphasis on security to an emphasis on justice , and all of us in our Member States have to get that balance right . #% I know that accession to the European Union is seen by many Cypriots as a path to security and stability and will lead to a situation where Cyprus is at the heart of decision-making in Europe , with a seat at the top table of European decision-makers . #% But let us have no illusions . #% We must respect the principle that policing can take place only with the consent of the communities being served . #% Finally , we must not weaken or lower the standards of our asylum systems under the guise of fighting terrorism , as the British Home Secretary is threatening to do . #% Because of a lack of coordination or cooperation , it has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned ; it has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out in a successful manner . #% There have been concerns expressed , although not followed up in amendments , about the extent of participation in such teams . #% First , I am also privileged to be a member of the ` CARS 21 ' Group , to which you referred earlier . #% The first amendment seeks to weaken the criticisms of the cost of the whole project and the second seeks to keep all areas eligible for aid , not just the less-favoured areas . #% Therefore we need to take action very quickly . #% We have to get out of this orthodoxy within the European Union of assuming that competitiveness in itself is the answer to all of our problems . #% 
I will not talk about fishing as such , but there are three general points that I think all the European Union institutions ought to address . #% If you want to indicate that you voted for or against , or abstained for a particular reason , this is the opportunity afforded by the Rules of Procedure to explain that nuance . #% At the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , the EU should sponsor a specific resolution on Zimbabwe and , in any case , use all means at its disposal over the coming vital weeks to ensure free and fair elections in that benighted country . #% They do not have to withdraw it , they do not have to take it away , they just have to make sure it does not go on the agenda of the next meeting . #% It was right not to declare the text dead , but to inaugurate a period of reflection -- one which has been much more about the context than about the text . #% Firstly , I should like to ask him what he judges his chances are of getting it through the Commission and , secondly , what happens after that ? #% It strengthens our capacity to act abroad and inside our Member States , making us prepared to stand on our own feet in world affairs , shaping Europe 's response to globalisation politically . #% I want to congratulate the Commission on the work it has been doing , on stepping up its efforts , and to congratulate the President of this Parliament for lending his authority to the establishment of the Assize . #% It is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals . #% Is he further aware that the payments made by these Spanish families have gone to Romanian foster families over a period of time , and thus these children are not officially abandoned according to international conventions , particularly the UN Convention , which has been ratified by the governments of all the Member States , including Spain and therefore forms a part of the acquis communautaire ? #% The first is the use of used cooking oil in the United Kingdom as animal feed . #% The IFF leverages money from international capital markets by issuing bonds which can potentially raise USD 50 billion each year from 2005 to 2015 . #% But , quite frankly , in most of the ACP countries where we have talked and worked with parliamentarians , they are seldom brought into the ambit of the work undertaken by their governments . #% Mr President , could I just explain to the President-in-Office of the Council that the last speech represents a very tiny minority of people in this Chamber and is not representative in any sense of the views of the European Parliament . #% What does it take to get the Council to point the finger at one of its own members ? #% NATO leaders must now question whether Albanian membership was granted too soon . #% What is worrying about this is that in the Doha agreement both the EU and the United States promised the smaller countries that they would have access to our textile and agricultural markets . #% Let me underline once again that this directive will only apply to new buses and will not threaten double-decker buses or Routemaster buses . #% May I also remind him that the job losses referred to are widely exaggerated . #% Mr Mandelson talks about Europe being able to adapt by moving up the value-added chain , but we have had this discussion many times . #% At the same time we have within the Maastricht Treaty a timetable laid down for monetary union which we need to stick to . #% All of us are extremely fortunate to be living in prosperous , democratic countries , and I for one , certainly hope we can open our doors to those who do not live in such fortunate circumstances . #% I do not know about God -- he has been around for a long time so he obviously has a healthy diet -- but I know what I think and that is that the Lisbon Process , among other things , requires us to have wellinformed consumers who make real choices which increase the marketability of the products they buy . #% It is not enough to demand military action if you are not prepared to provide the necessary forces , because we will have to have effective burden-sharing in any military action . #% This is a new insight , a new aspect of our work which has been particularly emphasized and underlined by his work and that of his Scandinavian colleagues . #% How we succeed in working with Kaliningrad will dictate how we succeed in working with the rest of the world . #% The risk would be to alienate public opinion in these countries against the Union and that would risk us being seen as vacuous and vacillators . #% We would also endorse the call made for the UN to deal with those profiteering from the pillage of natural resources , not least through the freezing of bank accounts and actions against companies . #% The progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy is another sign of the EU 's determination to create a single political entity with uniform rules for everyone . #% This Union has moved on . #% The report constitutes a useful analysis of measures to encourage theatre and the performing arts throughout the EU , particularly focusing on the need for mobility . #% It is a slippery slope . #% But before we do that , let us remind ourselves of the importance of services . #% Fourthly , we are concerned that some are simply not up to the job . #% India , you have our love , our respect and our prayers in this difficult time . #% That is what the Lisbon process is about and we are falling far short of that at the moment . #% Firstly , I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur Michael Cashman , his co-rapporteurs , the whole of the Civil Liberties Committee and the Swedish Presidency , who have been so vital in getting us to where we are today . #% This was widely published at the time -- in trade union newsletters , for example -- and no-one from the Commission seemed to have contradicted that . #% Apart from the matter of endocrine-disruptors raised by Mr Spencer , the Commissioner will be aware that there are others areas where EU legislation does not cover the ingestion of harmful substances through both the food chain and the water supply . #% Human rights issues are intensely political but it is a pity when they become the subject of partisan divisions . #% We want to hear that the Member States will sign Protocol No 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights which makes discrimination a direct infringement of the convention on the occasion of the convention ' s fiftieth anniversary in November . #% This Parliament , in its approach to Algeria , and to Albania , in the establishment of the conflict prevention network , and in its approach to the interinstitutional agreement on the financing of CFSP , has always shown that it is capable of developing a mature dialogue with the Council and the Commission . #% This Parliament has no competence in that area , either legislative or budgetary . #% However , in a debate where we are talking about third-country nationals , it is crucial that we are also very clear -- as the rapporteur has been -- that we are not talking about rolling back the hard-won rights of those individuals , but extending the rights to which our new Member States are entitled . #% I was delighted to hear yesterday that finance ministers were setting up a committee to look at harmonization of indirect taxation . #% Can I ask you to follow the same procedure ? #% This Commission deserves to be censured and future Commissioners need to know that they will be made politically responsible for the actions of those they direct . #% We have a clear and transparent process and a clear timetable for the approvals which ensure the mandatory consultation of the public which guarantees public registers of locations of GMOs grown and used . #% It is not what should happen and we have to remember that this week the World Food Summit is sitting in Rome . #% In connection with that last point , I am sure Mr Maystadt is aware of the ongoing court case in Lesotho , where European companies are on trial for allegedly paying bribes to win contracts in the Lesotho Highlands water project , a project part-funded by the EIB . #% We need to engage the US in constructive multilateral dialogue and to strengthen parliamentary involvement in this whole dialogue . #% Is it being duplicated ? #% It is very clear from your proposals , Commissioner , that you want to do just that and you have the support of the Labour delegation in this group and other delegations across this room . #% So the idea that you build up a resistance to it as an antibiotic is quite wrong . #% in writing . - UKIP condemns all forms of human trafficking as a modern day version of slavery and calls for the toughest penalties within the UK on such activity . #% That in itself party politicises nondiscrimination measures and fundamental rights . #% Is it , Mr Verhofstadt , because you are so embarrassed and ashamed that your own country is falling to pieces , that you come along here to encourage the rest of us to self-destruct as well ? #% Some Members have raised doubts about whether all the amendments that my report proposes are within the scope of the legal basis of the regulation - Article 255 of the Treaty . #% We have a mutual desire to see the necessary revision of the regulation within this legislature . #% Like others , we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women . #% The current influx of people from North Africa is , of course , just another beneficial crisis that gives the EU another opportunity to extend its power and dominion . #% The support and interest of this House is invaluable in all of these reform activities , both those relating to improvement in the gender balance and , much more widely , those seeking to ensure improvements in the efficiency of Commission staff and in professional support for them . #% We have always been responsible for our own policy decision-making on asylum applications and illegal immigrants and we should continue to do so . #% There can be no better example of this than the one million-signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg . #% Those who support the system would gain the satisfaction that the idea is kept alive - it goes forward to the Council and we will have to come back to it . #% We should ask the Court of Auditors to assess the performance of financial control systems in the applicant countries ; improve the Court of Auditors ' cooperation with the national audit institutions - which is a requirement of the Treaty of Nice - and establish more detailed specific DAS assessments - again , a requirement of the Treaty of Nice . #% 
Therefore , we really need to be paying attention to education and meeting the needs of the population who are also looking after those displaced people . #% I fully support the rapporteur 's view that the challenge is not simply one of closing chapters in negotiations but still one of dealing with endemic problems of corruption and political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria for democracy and human rights . #% We must revitalise the Lisbon process and ensure that we have an active social policy that gets people into work . #% Can we at least , if this happens in the future , have far more warning ? #% Once the insurers are in touch , matters are often settled by negotiation . #% My party has a clear vision of a Europe of nation states . #% It has made spectacular progress in the area of small to medium-sized enterprises , by far the biggest sector we could ever hope to address . #% For students from my own country there is always an imbalance between the number of Continental students wanting to go to the United Kingdom and the very limited number of British students prepared are willing to go to Continental countries . #% However , the candidate countries also have to realise that by joining the European Union they are committing themselves to the standards of the European Union , such as democracy and human rights . #% So we trust that will be remembered , as promised by Commission President Prodi , in the better governance arrangements and we are looking forward to the policy proofing and the impact on the social and environmental dimensions he mentioned today . #% Surely Saddam Hussein 's violations of the rights of the Kurds whom he has gassed , the Marsh Arabs and the Shias whom he has tortured and killed , and the Israelis , where he has paid the families of suicide bombers to kill innocent victims , are much worse than any of Milosevic 's crimes , - not to mention the British and the Americans whom he has sworn revenge against for our participation in the Gulf War . #% This will create markets for these drugs and lead to enormous market-driven pressures for parallel re-importation by unscrupulous middlemen from LDCs , which produce them cheaply as generics . #% in writing . - Whilst we are happy to see that common sense prevailed on misshapen fruit and vegetables , the British Labour MEPs still had some concerns with the Scottà report and have therefore voted against it . #% Secondly , in terms of the work outlined and personal experience , particularly in relation to the issue of providing information to the parents of children - to some extent setting aside the issues I raised in my question , as it is clear from the BBC report that parents of children are being completely misled by people wishing to exploit their offspring - are there perhaps grounds for involving the EU in some sort of campaign to overcome this problem of misinforming parents , to try and tackle the issue at source . #% Therefore I hope that Parliament and the Council will vote to maintain the concept as part of the partnership with research and development sectors and will include the practical means for the programme decision-makers to reach fair , just and accurate conclusions which also bear in mind the generic development industry . #% Families are unable to be together on a Sunday . #% How is it going to be defined ? #% But it is question of balance and getting ` European Arrest Warrant plus ' , and thus justice all round , through procedural guarantees to accompany simplified cross-border prosecutions . #% Now it is far less widely available and costs much more . #% I welcome the acknowledgement , as the rapporteur and others have already agreed in the report , of what is arguably the most neglected crisis spawned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic -- the plight of millions of profoundly vulnerable children who have been orphaned by the disease . #% The Commission has been a kangaroo court . #% Mr President , first of all , on the question of the availability of its reports , perhaps the Commission could show courtesy to this House by providing advance copy to the rapporteurs of this House rather than to the media . #% Governance can only be built brick by brick from the bottom , from the ground floor , from our nations and regions . #% It should be observed that there is nothing inherently intolerant and oppressive in the letter of the Islamic faith and in earlier centuries Islam exercised a culturally progressive and civilising influence . #% We have increasing numbers of death sentences in countries with which we have close relations . #% The distinction between developed and developing countries strikes me as odd . #% It is possible , if you wish , to swim in the sea off Blackpool in my region because of European Union laws that have improved the environment . #% Certainly Kosovo has shown the inadequateness of our response and we need to use that as an example to spur us on further . #% The fact that we are discussing the 1995 Commission report on monitoring the CFP in March 1998 is indicative of the slowness with which action is seen to be taken on enforcement . #% I believe that it is something that Parliament would like to see happen and something which we feel the Commission still has to address . #% We believe that the Treaty as it has turned out will not take things forward in the interests of the people . #% As far as I and the other signatories are concerned , that reference should remain in at the vote today . #% The Commission does not require more generalists and diplomats in its delegation , it needs competent managers , particularly those with expertise in tendering , contracting and , above all , project implementation ; personnel with business experience perhaps . #% You will know from the support for my report last year that colleagues have taken a very deep and intensive interest in the whole package of reforms and we have given you strong support for them . #% So , what did we achieve ? #% Yet the action programme , to be proposed by the Commission , is not yet a fully-fledged urban competence for the European Union . #% In that time , we have seen 190,000 animals suffer and be destroyed . #% It is unacceptable that Europe ' s directly elected representatives are , despite the presidency conclusions ' stress on democracy , marginalised in the creation of the area of freedom , security and justice . #% Now that the European Union is larger than the United States , richer than the United States and gives more assistance to the Third World than the United States , it is only right and proper that we have a common foreign and security policy dimension to that . #% There then follow two other cases which are perhaps more difficult and more complicated to get to grips with . #% The European Union is a self-perpetuating mega-bureaucracy that has carte blanche to finance its own programmes . #% I hope the Commission will also follow my opinion . #% I think the other controversial issue for us which is outstanding is the office-holders allowance . #% These things need to be dealt with on a fair and humane basis . #% The precedents are not good . #% This afternoon I am asking you personally what your proposals for action in this field are , both in the short term and in the long term , or is it perhaps a question you prefer to avoid ? #% In conclusion , Mr Karas has talked about some of the improvements we have made , and I agree with him about some of the areas into which I think we have intruded too far into Member States ' prerogatives . #% It would seem that some people were either preoccupied doing something else or we were not able to hear what was going on . #% Will the Minister urge the Council and the Commission to release any results on elder abuse across Member States , so that we can have an exchange of best practice ? #% This is a very important area for us in the European Parliament ; it would like the Union to send out a very positive message of good news for all of our citizens which will more than counteract some of the bad news that they tend to be inundated with at the moment . #% We believe that this is one of the most important instruments that we have been able to put in place in the last two or three years , with of course support from the European Regional Development Fund . #% Coming particularly to the statues , this destruction was much more than just a mindless act of violence by a regime that apparently intends to catapult us back into the Middle Ages . #% This has reinforced my view of the UK Independence Party as a group of paranoid reactionaries on the fringes of society who are now clearly prepared to throw their lot in with those who advocate the violent overthrow of governments . #% Because of the rise in the number of sufferers from this disease , there is often conflicting advice about the various treatments . #% The debate and vote on the first draft report was held on 16 November 2000 . #% However , defence procurement and securing the future of European defence industries are important . #% Finally , some comments , Mr President , on what the future holds . #% Mr President , this concerns the translation into English of the term ` loi organique ' , which has been rendered as ` organic law ' . #% He has spoken very clearly and I am sure that Commissioner Bolkestein has listened carefully to what he had to say . #% The reform should be taken further quickly so that no regionalist party , nor those of mainly Kurdish origin , should be under threat . #% Madam President , Belarus unexpectedly woke up to statehood in 1991 . #% Frankly this is a deliberate policy that is being pursued by the European Union year after year after year , and it is costing my country a great deal of money . #% One of the issues that I know the Commissioner is very much aware of , and which is reflected in some of the ideas in the Single Market Act which we will be bringing back to Parliament in two months ' time , is the fact that Member States need to start using and deploying these new instruments and encouraging businesses to use them . #% Above all , France and Holland 's democratic rejections of the failed EU Constitution are viewed with complete contempt by the Council , Commission and Parliament alike . #% The directive can deliver it and I hope will do so . #% Codecision is needed and , therefore , compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure need to be eradicated . #% 
On the second point , I should like to take this opportunity of saying what I told the Bureau of Parliament earlier today , and I have said it to many parliamentarians : the package of proposed reforms of the Staff Regulations are now before Parliament and the Council . #% It goes on to say that the control of the disease , as my colleague there has said , has failed because we are now having new outbreaks in the centre of Britain , in the centre of the region where we thought we were rid of it . #% That is why we must be consistent in implementing human rights policy and systematically follow up human rights abuses . #% When we look back at the SARS experience and when we look around at the constant threat of bioterrorism , we see the need for this centre to coordinate better , as the Commissioner has said , and we see the need for urgency in bringing this measure forward . #% I simply asked for a deadline to be set for the mission which our Parliament has agreed to send to the Spanish authorities . #% It was clear to me from the work of the Malta gay rights movement that the employment industrial relations act is not compliant with the employment framework directive , especially in relation to sexual orientation . #% It might have been worth considering whether a real ongoing dialogue might do more to assist improving human rights than merely passing resolutions . #% Mr President , this IGC will be supported by two parallel processes : the brave new world of a European defence policy and the defining of European citizenship within the drafting of the charter . #% Thereafter we will be out campaigning for the entry into force inside the Member States where referenda are to be held , including in France -- to oppose certain factions of the left -- and in Britain , where we will be fighting to oppose the right . #% That military action must continue until Kosovar Albanians are able to return to their homes in peace . #% Mr President , as long as people eat meat the treatment of farm animals will be the subject of lively debate . #% That is up to each Member State , but the functions should be separated so that they are both done well instead of badly . #% Indeed they will now be extended beyond the four Member States which currently recognise them and will also benefit from the passport . #% Mr President , perhaps I can assist the Commissioner here . #% A single government may well be tempted to hold the Union hostage . #% The scourge of child pornography and child sex abuse is a serious blight on our society , wrecking the lives of those most vulnerable and worthy of protection . #% This , as he knows full well , will restrict their ability to make progress to just Switzerland and the central and eastern European countries and we would regret that . #% I am not personally in favour of a system that shifts to one of voluntarism on an ad hoc basis state by state , nor is my Group . #% Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law . #% Whilst welcoming peace proposals from the Colombian Government , we recognize the serious and outstanding questions of human rights abuse against state authorities , including the apparent sanctioning of paramilitary violence through Conviver . #% It would help young Europeans channel their efforts on a broader level than just national . #% In contrast to last month 's debate on EU-China relations , his work and report have been a model of cooperation and consensus and my Group and I will be supporting his report . #% Given that there is no technology for side-facing seats , then we must say to industry that these particular seats must be phased out . #% I warmly thank the two Commissioners , Mrs Gradin and Mr Flynn , for their support and persistence . #% It took five years of negotiation to reach the agreement in the maritime sector . #% I would like to express to the farming community in the United Kingdom our great sympathy and concern with this situation . #% However , freedom of capital movements must not be exploited for undesirable purposes . #% Mr President , we all recognise the need to cut greenhouse gases and we all want to see policies on cleaner fuels . #% I suggest to you that this is going in the wrong direction : it is not helping small businesses , it is not helping large businesses , it is not helping open source movement . #% I have met people who turned out not to be infected , but only after months of uncertainty as to whether they were infected or not . #% We are not going to go anywhere if Member States do not actually produce the goods they have promised to produce . #% You are 50 % more likely to have an accident at work if you work for a small to medium-sized business . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the new provision for building parliamentary capacity in ACP countries is particularly welcome . #% These are legislative problems and therefore legislators need to be present . #% Could we ask the Commission to make a statement about employment prospects in the EU automobile sector ? #% It asked for 33 % , knocked down by the Council to 27 % . #% One is that every single Member of the current Commission agrees to resign on an agreed date , or this Parliament adopts a motion of censure forcing them to resign . #% I deeply regret this and , as this House followed East Timor 's independence struggle closely , many will join me in protest at the fact that nobody is going to be punished for these massacres . #% Mr Görlach produced an excellent report on the Commission proposals for rural development and put forward a small number of very practical amendments to bring them more closely in line with the Cork Declaration which the Commission had watered down somewhat . #% I should like , first of all , to comment on Mr Van Velzen 's report on reuse of public information . #% There are some difficult issues -- such as Holocaust denial and protecting freedom of speech -- but it is scandalous that in 2006 there is still no EU-wide response to the alarming and increasing problem of racist violence . #% It is one that they are completely ignorant of , and they are completely ignorant of the impact of this decision on the Caribbean . #% Their economies are invariably fragile ones and it is just not good enough that the farmers on the Isle of Lewis have to pay twice as much for their hay as farmers living near Inverness . #% The other point was extraordinary bonuses . #% The sanctions are controversial in that Saddam has been able to persuade some significant elements of international opinion that it is sanctions that are the cause of the distress of the Iraqi people rather than his own actions . #% Article 51 of the UN Charter states that ` nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations . ' #% It was Zeus who kidnapped Europa , and my fear is that you are kidnapping our democracy . #% We want to act as a budgetary authority , not going back to the old days where you voted on compulsory expenditure , we voted on non-compulsory and sometime in December we ended up with a budget . #% We have quite a body of information on consultation laws , but the inconsistencies and contradictions between them and the loopholes in them mean that they are often avoided altogether . #% I would ask this House to give urgent consideration to the exclusion of those citizens and to secure their representation in this Parliament so they can bring their concerns to this House themselves . #% One size does not fit all , whether it is trade policy or shoe sizes . #% The Commission needs to be much quicker and lighter on its feet on such issues , but then , so do we all . #% What will the European Commission be doing to ensure women 's rights to property , shelter and proper protection when they return to Rwanda ? #% Whilst issues such as netting seem to have been slotted in as an extra series of amendments , what we have here is a workable document nonetheless , capable of securing support in the House and provoking serious discussion within the Council . #% To conclude , we must not play politics with passenger safety . #% We must seek to ensure that the vitality and the independence of the press are retained under the new conditions . #% The only thing I hold back from is setting specific objectives for the percentage of women that should reach this grade or that grade or that position or another position . #% Idealistic as this may sound , I have received a great deal of support from both the Commission and the representatives of the ACP regions and , despite the many concerns expressed by NGOs and political groups , they and I , and I am sure the Commission , remain optimistic . #% He was followed by Mrs Lynne - also due to speak today - who reinforced what was said with great vigour . #% Mrs Wallström told this Chamber on Tuesday evening that people will get what she chose to call ` information ' about the Constitution , but I doubt it will point out , as eminent constitutional lawyers already have , that the Constitution totally reverses the relationship between the EU and the Member States . #% Recently the prospectuses directive was adopted and now - I believe , because of the activities of this Parliament - protects small - to medium-sized businesses from the bureaucratic requirements of continual registration or the dangers that threatened their ability to have access to funding . #% The Constitution is about how we do things , when our attention should be focused on what we do . #% For the European Union 15 , the figures have been steadily improving over the last decade , but there is still nothing to be proud of . #% As more and more money destined for academia comes through the European institutions , the European piper is indeed now calling the European tune . #% I know that the money he has been offered by Telefónica hardly can be justified by the description of a handful of silver and indeed it begs the question of just how seriously Members of this House will treat a company like Telefónica when it comes to lobby us as they surely will on the matter of the review and future legislation in this field . #% In the European Parliament we have over the years consistently denounced the oppression imposed on the people of East Timor and their suffering at the hands of the Indonesian regime . #% 
Too often in the past they have wanted to keep the European Union and its institutions away from the UN rather than ensuring effective collaboration . #% Decisions to end infringement of fundamental rights must be taken in the political context and can not be taken regardless of those consequences . #% They also show no understanding of the needs of the industry , or its employees . #% Which CAP beneficiaries are prepared , like the UK Government , to make public the information about where the money goes ? #% If we do , we run the risk that the problems will manifest themselves on our doorsteps . #% Can I ask this question , and it is a sincere one : what flexibility do the Maastricht criteria allow and permit ? #% The converse also applies . #% The Amsterdam Treaty , in developing a more effective common foreign and security policy , stressed the importance of closer institutional and organizational links between the EU and the WEU , including the evolution of the Petersberg humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks . #% The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time . #% The letter reminded me of a drug addict in denial , addicted to subsidies . #% In my view , this outgoing Commission has made more positive progress than any preceding Commission in recent times and I thank him for his efforts . #% These are capable of being used by any of the parties to those rules , so we have a major advance in transparency which I think works to the benefits of services and Commissioners and Commissioners ' cabinets . #% That doubt has now fallen over the position of the United Kingdom and its entitlement to Structural Funds because the United Kingdom government has not fully implemented or complied with the provisions of the habitats directive . #% We have seen two recent instances of American action on steel and now American action to increase agricultural subsidies . #% Capabilities are limited . #% We are now talking about implementation of the first stage in September 2000 and the second stage in September 2001 . #% However , it is clear that there must be some measure of control , and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner 's strategy in due course . #% I am grateful to them for their work . #% The people of Slovakia have every right to choose their own government . #% author . - Mr President , I was one of those politicians who supported the Iraq war back in 2003 in the belief that Saddam Hussein posed a serious long-term risk to regional stability , but also because of the horrendous brutality of his Baathist regime . #% Our national traditions are very divergent on this but it is right that it comes before plenary , and in many groups there will be differences of opinion on this . #% The matter of pensions is a hugely important issue , and I say that not just because I have a vested interest in this matter , being close to pensionable age myself : it is an issue of increasing importance to the people , for example , sitting up at the top in the gallery there . #% Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world . #% I have no goal of replacing a Pact that does not work well with one that seems to function but goes wrong later ' . #% As a number of speakers have already said , we are not civil servants - we represent the citizens of the four corners of the European Union , here at its centre . #% I want to say very briefly that we have to clamp down on sex tourism and make sure that nationals from Member States can be prosecuted if they commit a crime in third countries . #% The creation of a new public space around the building and the provision of the security glass wall are just two of the consequences of that integrative approach . #% In particular , would you agree that there is a need for a further stimulus - the ETUC has suggested 1 % of GDP - aimed at a positive entry strategy into the labour market that would be aimed at protecting viable employment and creating new jobs , in promoting intelligent work sharing ? #% It is important that those on lower incomes receive financial support to help them attend training courses , which would , in turn , give them more opportunity to fully integrate themselves in the labour market . #% It is taxpayers ' money , and I would have liked to have seen a Commission work programme that took this scandalous situation much more seriously and proposed action to deal with it . #% In this instance , not once have you identified who has asked for the roll call vote . #% Of course , the European Union has turned its back on the new GM technology which has dramatically reduced the reliance on pesticides by our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic . #% He was successful in that application and I am pleased to say that he was duly appointed . #% Indeed , the motion for a resolution I saw this morning contained no mention of any internal market or information society initiatives at all , despite the work that has been going on under your Presidency . #% It has to be used discreetly and effectively if it is to bring results . #% There are a few last comments on other aspects - budget control and value for money . #% The second point where the hearings were flawed was in the failure to hold indicative votes at the end of each hearing . #% That is why we welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution which we will adopt is not calling for significant changes to the draft Constitution . #% Amendment 16 in particular was crafted very carefully to get over the international legal difficulties in that respect . #% But the heat is now on , following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , with the so-called cedar revolutionaries on the streets of Beirut . #% They were sent by a friend a month ago , following the terrible date of 28 April when death and riots hit Dili again . #% My group will not vote to postpone the entry into force of the European arrest warrant until there are common minimum standards of procedural law . #% I congratulate the Austrian presidency on the work it has done . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . - Mr President , may I start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that he has done on this extremely important report . #% 1999 is not the year for which this Commission is responsible . #% In fact it all sounds a bit like the same sort of thing UKIP has been saying for the last ten years and I am delighted to hear it . #% I am not in any way against the intentions or sentiments of the report but solely in respect of the action plan on Sri Lanka . #% If that can not be shown clearly , then the legality of the temporary ban can and should be questioned in this case . #% We also identified that there was an important category of vehicle for disabled users - ` wheelchair accessible vehicles ' - which were series volume vehicles modified to allow access by wheelchair passengers . #% I hope Members will draw that to the attention of their colleagues who may be wandering around outside looking for them . #% Mr President , we meet at a time when congestion in our skies has never been greater . #% The issue is being decided at present by the Court of Human Rights and will not go away . #% I would like to congratulate Commissioner Palacio for having the initiative to bring this to our committee in the terms that she did , and with the force and verve that she has shown , initially , in setting up the high level group , and also in the leadership that she has given to addressing this problem . #% The response we got from the DGs - with very thorough analysis seeking to detect any practices remotely related to what we have observed in Eurostat - was rigorous and encouragingly thorough . #% There are safety considerations with the use of aspartame . #% I look forward with great interest to what Mr Byrne will say . #% He stresses that in Togo there exists a vocal and active political opposition which chairs some of the most important parliamentary committees . #% The EU 's commitment to diversification of source and supply under a common external energy security policy must surely strengthen our hand at the negotiating table with Russia . #% If harmonising rules is too difficult , at least recognise the right of any company to do business anywhere in the Union once authorised by one Member State . #% For these reasons , the approach that I took , supported by our shadows , in formulating Parliament 's position , was to strongly support the aim of improving the completeness , relevance and comparability of the statistics on offer in this field , bringing the statistics more up to date with new trends in the tourism sector to reflect , for instance , the increase in Internet bookings and in short-stay trips . #% -- The question is specifically about strengthening democratic forces in Iran . #% The Virgin report itself involves a cooperation procedure which will take months , or perhaps years if the Council does not get a move on . #% I also like the proposal - though perhaps it is not enough - that some of the catch should compulsorily be landed in Guinea for the food supply of the Guinean population . #% Mr President , in the rarefied atmosphere of this House it is very easy to lose touch with reality . #% Are we going to have rooms which we are going to have to adjust for over 20 languages so that in every room where there is a discussion in this Parliament every person has the right to use their own language ? #% That proposal , which has been accepted by the Vietnamese side , aims to encourage and support the continued commitment of the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues . #% 
By just putting a noun with an adjective you can not always make sense . #% The situation in Sierra Leone continues to be extremely unstable . #% We would like to see a solution as quickly as possible . #% Juliet accidentally pricked her thumb on the needle after it slipped when she was taking a sample . #% It is also right to begin to open EU markets , including our agricultural markets , to poorer countries that wish to trade with us , in ways that benefit them more directly and prevent future migratory pressures by the long-term stabilisation of their own economies . #% Mr President , North Korea is a brutal , secretive communist dictatorship . #% We do not support those amendments . #% I was interested to hear Mr Hallam 's comments in the long tradition in the UK of Socialists supporting champagne . #% It may be that we simply have to wait for things to burn themselves out . #% One of the paragraphs referred to the stereotyped image of Islam and Muslims in the western media . #% That must be the best mid-term hope for these starving children . #% The future must be about encouraging innovation and technology , not about tricking people who have no alternative into paying more tax . #% As far as offshore workers and mobile workers in the transport sector are concerned - there was an attempt in the common position to allow annualisation of working time for those workers without collective agreement . #% It must also be made clear that the right of return for Palestinians can only apply to the new state of Palestine , as otherwise the Jewish State of Israel 's , security would be compromised . #% I would hope that Members on all sides of the House could support that . #% We had part of this House announce even before the hearings started that they intended to reject the Commission . #% Already , we have 55 000 people claiming some form of State benefit . #% In this connection , there has been discussion of other amendments in the name of Mr Sifunakis : Amendments 62 and 63 , which refer to conflicts in Spain , Portugal and Greece . #% I particularly welcome the request that we delay for three months . #% The various draftsmen of opinions from the different committees have all provided the expertise which was properly supportive of what Mr Nassauer has done . #% Could you please slow down ? #% However , we must not be naive : these proposals and the way in which they are being promoted by some in this House give all suspected criminals the same procedural safeguards . #% First of all I am unhappy that we have lost one-third of our offices to an unnecessary bathroom . #% The Minister will be aware that the Court of Justice is already deploying the Charter quite broadly in its jurisprudence . #% In the UK General Election last month , you got 35.3 per cent , which is 10 per cent less than Jacques Chirac got . #% The person named by the honourable Member , who is a Commission official , has indicated total readiness to respond to all enquiries from the Swedish prosecutor . #% We should have acknowledged here that European railway systems are all different , and their diversity merits the derogations proposed . #% I can not say the same , however , for her unwelcome slurs on my colleague Mr Elles , particularly as he is not here to answer them . #% Of course , we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks . #% The world championship is of interest to people all over the world and certainly throughout Europe , and the number of seats that has been made available to European football fans is derisory . #% The last thing we need , when action against Iraq is in the air , is uncertainty about military arrangements in Afghanistan . #% However , in his review he is concealing a little - applying legerdemain - with regard to the sheep and goatmeat report . #% We regret that the Framework Directive for Services of General Interest did not gain majority support : we do need to find a way to differentiate core essential services provided for the public good from the services we choose as individuals . #% It is a little later than it might have been , but that is because there has been a full external evaluation and a full consultation of all stakeholders , which has informed the Commission 's proposal and indeed the recommendations from the Council . #% Do you intend to ensure that the mission to Spain takes place as soon as possible , if necessary with a different envoy ? #% He has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hard-hitting report . #% I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force . #% I believe I am the only Member of this Parliament who has visited Chernobyl , Khmelnitsky and Rivne , the three stations which have featured frequently in our debates . #% Six more months of the Foreign Office , Mr Blair and Mr Alexander , six more months of this , and it will be obvious to all that the United Kingdom is a square peg in a round European hole . #% If there is a vote taking place and it is a normal procedure , a ten-minute wait means that we will be late for the vote . #% I will say this quite bluntly : if the Commission can not run the common fisheries policy properly , then send it back to the Member States and let them do it . #% Almost as patronising as giving the women in this room a rose when they came in . #% The industry was aware of the dodgy and unsafe fittings of the casks and I am given to understand that the smaller casks , which were transported to Sellafield had never been tested for their effectiveness , safety and efficiency . #% I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation . #% Mr President , the week before last we were addressed by the British Prime Minister , Tony Blair . #% Madam President , I just wish to emphasise on behalf of the Liberal Group the desirability of debating and voting this report this week . #% The process of evaluation of staff , and that of course includes managers at all levels , is being refined and will be introduced . #% There are two other points I wish to comment on . #% We must find a sufficiently flexible form of modifying the Constitutional settlement if we are to be able to move with the changing circumstances we will face in the years to come . #% Otherwise the rules will continue to be bypassed . #% I also voted in favour of the Green Amendment 22 pointing out the delay and escalating costs of the fusion power ITER project . #% Today is an historic day for the European Union and I am delighted and proud to play a small role by voting yes on all the enlargement reports before us . #% The problem is that many people , even today , do not feel obliged or encouraged to save for their retirement . #% Can I also add that attention should also be paid to the plight of refugees in Hong Kong and I hope that this question is settled swiftly . #% The architecture that we should develop will be very different from the architecture we have today where carrying-capacity is constrained . #% The question regarding the use of depleted uranium oxide in Kosovo or Serbia was not addressed . #% These rules should provide legitimate derogations for specific clearly-defined reasons , but should not be interpreted in a broad sense , which would essentially have the result of denying public access to documents . #% We are all websites now . #% The main objective of this legislation and the agreements around it is to give people the right to make a genuine choice about GM products . #% We need to express support for the democratic opposition which is working very hard both within and outside Sudan . #% I think it is impossible to under-estimate the importance of what has been achieved in Copenhagen . #% There are valid environmental and road safety reasons to transport goods - if they must be transported by road - at night . #% Whether we like it or not , the war against terror is real and it is now . #% If we do vote against , let me make it clear that it will not be because we disagree with the content of that report , but because we took a stand to keep this report as short as possible . #% Would he envisage such a scheme under his reform proposals for the CAP ? #% It also rightly reiterates the role of an integrated transatlantic market by 2015 . #% 
Now we are coming to the point where , in the testing of chemicals , perhaps we ought to have an absolute assurance ( and I know Commissioner Byrne has gone some way towards this already ) that we will minimise - and I use that word advisedly - the number of animals sacrificed in the validation of chemical testing . #% To these suggestions I would add that the G3 or the G7 should not exclude other important global players , including Asia and ASEAN , whose parliamentary representatives are in conclave with Euro-MPs this morning here in Strasbourg . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner can explain why he has not acted more firmly and insisted earlier that a unanimous scientific opinion is not negotiable . #% It is also right that a whole series of questions should be asked in terms of simplifying the process of legislation , on clarifying competencies of the Union and indeed restoring perhaps one or two to Member States , as is mentioned . #% At the time I refuted it . #% Forty years of integration have ended up with a divided family despite all the fine words about mutual recognition of qualifications . #% The cumulative effect contributes significantly to air pollution . #% I start by offering , on behalf of my Group , our condolences to the relatives and friends of all victims of aviation accidents , not just the recent one in Sharm el-Sheikh . #% The military element is from a third state , so we , following in the steps of the ECJ , argue that the Directive can indeed apply . #% Those Member States should hang their heads in shame and remember and honour the obligations they gave to this Parliament in 2001 . #% The United Kingdom will soon fully liberalise , along with Germany and the Netherlands , which means that 60 % of the market will be liberalised . #% The EU put a good deal on the table ; we were waiting for serious counter-offers and were sadly disappointed by what came back . #% The rule of law , as Mr Cushnahan has said , is crucial to the future of Hong Kong . #% - I find it incredible , given the anti-Brussels hysteria of his UKIP allies , that Mr Blokland has managed to produce such an over-regulated monster of a report . #% All books and publications , with the exception of newspapers , are still subject to censorship . #% I would like also to raise the issue of Belarus , which has borders with four of the Member States that are party to the action plan and , given its union with Russia , might one day become part of the group . #% We are all aware of her desire to streamline these expenditures but it is right to point out once again that these are some of the most effective , most visible and most direct forms of European aid to our regions and localities . #% Only when the European institutions and the Member States adopt ideas such as these , will we again gain the reputation for financial probity that we desire and which the public demands . #% However a common tariff is set up , it will disadvantage ACP countries , causing loss of production and unemployment . #% Fourth , the Constitution introduces greater rights for citizens through the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which has been incorporated into the Constitution . #% It is , of course , the case that nobody , particularly liberals in favour of free inquiry , could object to the Commission 's study on this subject . #% The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors . #% She said that we ought to talk to the consumer groups in Europe and see what they think . #% This is a consequence of activities by the former Soviet Army and more especially by warring factions over the past ten years . #% Article 70 of the Basic Law says that these elections should be held within three months of the dissolution of the existing Legislative Council . #% The democracies must work closely together to combat terrorism in whatever form it takes and whatever excuses are used by the perpetrators . #% We can agree with the emphasis placed on the fight against fraud and mismanagement . #% If citizens do not responsibly demonstrate against the operation of inhumane acts by their governments , the governments become increasingly irresponsive and corrupt . #% In an increasingly flexible or precarious working environment people will be thrown back on their inner resources at many times in their lives and social cohesion is partly dependent on such personal resilience . #% Commissioner Byrne has listened to the temporary committee and has come forward with some good proposals . #% How would the Commissioner square the need for competition that guarantees plurality with the technical advances which - according to those who operate it and profit by it - will come from the unregulated market ? #% I wish , when politicians , whether they be in this Parliament , the Council of Ministers or the Commission , decide they would promote programmes of this kind and raise people 's expectations - particularly young people across the European Union - that they would be prepared to back their protestations and provide money for such programmes . #% We must exempt volunteers from taxes on their expenses . #% My message to the European Parliament is that REACH has shown us how intimately the work of each of us affects that of the other . #% We are pleased that early retirement has been extended to the political groups , and thank the Council for that - even if it is absent from this debate this afternoon . #% She particularly mentions that the agency should take the lead on energy in Kosovo , with which I would agree . #% Young people need education , not isolation ; they need to understand the world in all its diversity and be taught respect for those who are different . #% We have problems that are no longer just a result of civil war but are due to famine , the weather , contaminated water , abysmal sanitation and desertification . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for a very long , detailed and serious reply . #% It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level , and many valued and skilled people found themselves with redundant skills overnight . #% Indeed that is something we aim to do and we also have the necessary policy instruments . #% We need a decision-making structure which respects the sensitivity of national sovereignty and the sensitivity of some of these issues to our Member States but still allows us to make progress . #% It is outrageous that common rules in the field of civil aviation security do not automatically apply to Gibraltar because of the ongoing refusal by Spain to recognise Gibraltar as a full part of the European Union . #% Despite the small number of MEPs who are present tonight , this is a very important piece of legislation . #% I hope enough MEPs will join us tomorrow when we vote , in particular those Labour MEPs who voted against us in committee and against the UK Labour Government . #% We must take this step forward , but inevitably we must also allow for the fact that this step needs to be accommodated not just by the environment but economically as well . #% Madam President , I would just like to reiterate something that was said yesterday in the minutes about the large number of roll-call votes . #% It remains a problem for Parliament on how far individual countries should be named in this report . #% There is a second article in the Herald Tribune today on exactly the same page where Mr Crystal , who is editor of the Weekly Standard , says : `` Republicans will argue that American security can not be safeguarded by international conventions . #% I had discussions with the Foreign Minister , the Interior Minister , the President of the Supreme Court and police chiefs , including those running the national organisation for combating organised crime . #% Those criteria - especially the public debt and budget deficit litmus test - have themselves been subject to wilful misinterpretation . #% Last week I was assured by Commissioner Bolkestein 's office that information would be available . #% What colour would you like the gates ? ' #% The EU had a budget plan until 2013 and the WTO concluded the Hong Kong declaration . #% I ask this House to reject the motion . #% This is not before time . #% That is why I will vote ` no ' to all ten countries ' accession . #% I refuse to do that . #% Could we have an assurance that the Council will remain in its place at 9 p.m. in order to take part in the debate on the Papayannakis report ? #% But Azerbaijan 's President has committed himself now to holding free and fair parliamentary elections this November . #% Otherwise , we would only have high inflation and massive increases in the mountain of national debt . #% That is the best advice that I can give you and many Members of this Parliament also . #% Following the model of the Bergen Framework , setting up the EUROPASS diploma and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQF level . #% He has distinguished himself by adopting relatively liberal economic policies , and has introduced an improved regulatory system and land reform . #% Where we have not done that , my Group has tabled two amendments which will rectify that situation and , indeed , get rid of a contradiction which we believe exists in the report at present . #% Our main concern is that the Tindemans report fails to strike an appropriate balance in these matters . #% 
The United States and the EU are pushing bottom lines that in practice are probably undeliverable . #% If the Cambodian people want these trials to proceed , and the political situation is sufficiently stable to permit them , then it is only natural that the international community , through the UN , should wish to support them in that aim . #% Finally , it is reasonable to say - and I hope Mr Friedmann agrees with me - that there should be no substantial increase in own resources until all income is collected and until we can be reassured that all revenue is not only legal but is properly , efficiently and effectively spent . #% I totally agree this should be done on a case-by-case basis , a point he explicitly amplifies in paragraph 13 about the principles of subsidiarity , necessity and proportionality . #% That is why I - and up until now - my group have always been very reticent about the idea of moving towards a system of double majority in the Council . #% But in Commissioner Patten 's interview in Herat on Monday , it was indicated that Brussels was frustrated that the Israelis did not seem to appreciate the EU link . #% It almost seemed to us , as Mr Bowis has said , that it was picking a figure out of a hat . #% Mr President , I am going to have to interrupt this consensus debate , because I am afraid I can not support Mrs Honeyball 's report . #% If you speak to the cabin crew themselves , they do not want to create a situation where , possibly , some airline operators could differentiate between cabin crew and create a two-tier system . #% We should like to believe that the Council is listening and responding to them . #% I hope that there will be wide and integrated Commission strategies to stimulate European action across the board , bringing together policy initiatives on transport , industry , taxation and agriculture . #% Why do we want that ? #% Despite discussions in Strasbourg on my report , he subsequently offered no amendments . #% For some of us , placing the LTTE on the terrorist list has led to a totally predictable reaction and the SLMM is no longer able to operate at full force or as effectively as we would want . #% It is very important that we at least make the effort to get into position now something that is trying to address the issue , trying to face up to the challenge . #% I would like to know which countries have not implemented the employment directive , which countries have not put into place anything to start to implement that directive and what sanctions the Commission is going to take against those countries to make sure they implement it . #% Endangered wildlife and habitats are a precious and irreplaceable asset . #% I too would like to say that I have enjoyed working in health and safety . #% Sir , you have no legitimacy in this job at all , and I can say with confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people in saying : we do not know you , we do not want you , and the sooner you are put out to grass , the better . #% I greatly welcome that . #% Second , I should like to clear up the issue raised in the original question about payments of GBP 1 000 . #% Much has been made of the DPRK 's secret acquisition of uranium enrichment technology in breach of the spirit , if not the letter , of the 1994 framework agreement . #% Similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the Cotonou Agreement would suggest that we should proceed . #% They need to be informed and reassured . #% I look forward to a strong Commission proposal next summer . #% Mr President , I have great pleasure in responding on behalf of the EPP and ED Group , and on behalf of my colleague , Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl , who was the shadow rapporteur in the Industry Committee but who unfortunately can not be here tonight . #% The Council , Commission and Parliament must work together to ensure that we build a stronger , more robust , global economy that works for the European Union as a whole . #% If we do not get an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective especially , I am fairly certain that Article 272 will be invoked . #% We recognise of course that each postal market is unique , but that can not excuse serious regulatory asymmetry leading to serious market distortions . #% It comes very close to doing that . #% We look at what will be happening to political prisoners under this regime as a clear indicator of its intentions . #% In this respect I am extremely heartened by the fact that the Dutch practice of tripartite meetings between big business , SMEs and the trade unions is now receiving its British expression in the first tentative meetings between the GMB Union and the Forum of Private Business . #% We believe that the Daphne programme is very badly needed and trust that it will shortly be provided with more resources and a more open and democratic system for decision-making . #% We must avoid this at all costs . #% That is why I broadly support the Council position which represents a small but important step towards railway liberalisation . #% Can he look , when he talks about inter-operability , at linkages . #% There are governments that want to reopen the question of the composition of the Commission . #% Has it just responded immediately to a SEAC suggestion ? #% There are so many people dying each year or becoming sick and injured that we need to do everything we can to ensure that the activities of the European Union are focused in such a way that reduction is given priority . #% In particular the need to strengthen the EHLASS system of research and information sharing is fundamental and exemplifies the need for the internal Commission coherence to which I alluded earlier . #% Mrs Thors has already mentioned issues about the mutual recognition of qualifications . #% The cost of starting up a business varies across the European Union and there is some progress . #% We believe in both men and women playing their full role in the life of our own nation and elsewhere and oppose any discrimination on the ground of gender . #% These reports were adopted in committee last autumn and we in our committee were unanimously of the opinion that nine months is a long enough gestation period for any report . #% Madam President , I would just like to say I was present although I am not included in the list at the back . #% If everyone submitted amendments directly to the plenary then plenary sessions would last 24 hours . #% In Belgium it costs at least twice as much to collect the batteries as the actual value of the batteries themselves . #% Mr President , I wish to address my remarks to Mrs Thyssen 's report , which I welcome , and I congratulate her on such a balanced piece of work . #% Many of us are concerned about the situation of the overseas countries and territories in relation to the EDF . #% The Deutschmark interest rate remained high , with enormous knock-on effects on Europe 's economy and its ability to climb out of its economic pause - to borrow a phrase favoured by the Commission . #% All systems , be they national parliamentary or European Parliamentary systems , have methods of delegating powers to the executive : implementing powers , secondary legislation - call them what you like . #% We should also make it perfectly clear that we regard , in the European Union , it as important that the people and the country of Slovakia should ultimately achieve their rightful place inside the European Union . #% Moreover , the instrument should be based on the principle of reciprocity with regard to abuses that take place on EU soil as well as those abroad . #% I concede that he has been consistent throughout in seeking to block this report by every means and at every turn . #% We can not even manage to enforce a travel ban in respect of our own institutions . #% It is business as usual and you are going to press on with enlargement ; you are going to press on with a common asylum policy despite the fact that your own countrymen and virtually nobody else wants it ; and I heard you say you are going to press for ` better regulation ' . #% The information is not to be given to all Members but to a select and privileged cartel within this Parliament . #% A food agency , which some have doubts about , is to me as credible and as necessary as an environment agency , about which there were also doubts at its inception . #% I am sure I would be in the Commission 's bad books by so doing . #% We still have problems with additionality , added to which we have the problem that the British Government has removed from local government every scrap of finance that can be used for matching funding . #% President Akayev , who came from a background of the Academy of Sciences , was elected in a free vote in 1991 and re-elected in 1995 , has subsequently become more of an oppressive president than a democratic one . #% Madam President , coherent action is urgently required at local , national and European levels to clean up our land , sea and air . #% Commissioner Oreja 's answer to my parliamentary question on 13 June when he said that services are provided from Norwich or should be sublet from Norwich is wholly unacceptable . #% Thank you Madam President , Commissioner and colleagues . #% What we need is to include the fast-growing economies of Asia in that process and , at the same time , look at how we can involve the developing world in that process . #% We also support the principle of mutual recognition , and free movement rights should be assured for European citizens , but abuse of those rights must be curtailed through strong border controls and by using the EU 's weight to secure quicker returns , and through the development of Frontex protecting the EU 's external borders . #% 
Yesterday 's debate clearly illustrated how far we have still to go in establishing equality of respect within the EU . #% They are the ones who keep them in misery . #% We are not talking here of the death penalty as such , which remains legal in international law and is still practised in a number of democracies , not only the United States , but also Russia , India , Caribbean islands , Japan and Singapore to name but a few . #% I say to the Council : how many people have to die before it does something about Kosovo ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I hope very much that Lithuania will learn from the experience in the UK , which went through its own agonies of having a law which banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools . #% This resolution condemns the lack of coherence in EU policy and calls on the Council and governments of the Member States not to seek exemptions from the EU 's own sanction regime , which can be misread . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Party of European Socialists , I would like to begin by expressing my wholehearted support for this proposal for a directive amending the original directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers . #% It was only with some difficulty that Parliament obtained these Minutes and managed to examine these secret declarations . #% The Council , by its absence today , shows its lack of interest in the way in which we , as a Parliament , have used our powers to begin the birth of a political Europe . #% We should also drop the principle of equal rotation . #% The Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances should be used to compensate for natural handicaps and not to achieve environmental goals . #% I would just like to highlight some of those points this evening . #% I sit on the Committee on Culture and Education , which , through its rapporteur , will of course dutifully produce a report for us all to vote on . #% It is only irresponsible armed forces such as those in former Yugoslavia and armed groups of non-state actors engaged in civil war and insurgency that continue to use these dreadful weapons . #% Such requirements can bring about changes in investment priorities , ensuring that money is channelled into research and innovation , with great potential for the future . #% The human cost is incalculable : thousands of family holidays were ruined this summer with people kept waiting in hot and antiquated airports . #% Mr President , we can celebrate today a number of victories for the European Parliament on things which , not very long ago , we were told would never possibly be agreed at the Laeken European Council . #% Again I agree with the Commissioner that this should be for the companies themselves , for the employers , and the workers directly involved . #% Often it is the poor who are convicted -- a mother selling her daughter , for instance , to put food on the table . #% The hushkits issue is also widely seen as a first case of how aviation issues will be dealt with in the future by the new Parliament and the new Commission . #% The fact that we now have cross-group support for this resolution shows the intensity of feeling which exists in this House against the iniquitious failure to pay by the United States . #% On average , in the EU , women earn 17 % less than men . #% I could respond to Mr Tannock 's rather pathetic remarks , but it belittles this debate to bring in all sorts of other issues when we are talking about Cuba . #% Thirdly , there are also the environmental benefits - the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles . #% This is not the return of the prodigal son . #% I also congratulate the Commission on the speed of its response to the humanitarian crisis , despite the difficulties it is having to face at the moment . #% Will the risk assessments finally rule out its use ? #% I am not particularly confident but we shall watch to see how that goes . #% Under its auspices , British utility companies ( including water , gas , electricity and telephone companies ) have already reported that they expect to offer ` business as usual ' over the millennium . #% Not everyone will agree with the full contents of the report , but overall it is very good and he is to be congratulated . #% We are very grateful for the advice and I hope my colleagues and I will be able to remedy that in the forthcoming general election . #% Therefore , on Monday we expressed our reservations about one of the candidates . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , the Czech Presidency has followed a depressingly familiar pattern : continuity , more of the same , the continuing obsession with climate change and the continuing drive to have new legislation . #% In the wake of these developments , it is the role of the European Union and international community to keep open this moment of hope . #% It is a matter of great urgency and anxiety among the agricultural community in those countries which are not going to be in the first wave of EMU because they are subject , not merely to the vagaries of weather and climate and the changes in CAP reform , WTO and GATT , but will continue to have considerable anxieties about the vagaries of currency exchange . #% The original proposal would have seen such bull bars taken off the market . #% I welcome Parliament maintaining its position to exclude health services from the scope of the Services Directive . #% The European Parliament position is , and always has been , realistic and morally right . #% Up until now , the Community has been represented by all its individual Member States and , from my limited observations , that also brings a richness and strength to the work of the conference because of the diversity of our own legal traditions and our own comparative legal experience . #% Millions and millions of people across Europe now depend on caravanning for their holiday . #% Can I just ask : is the next step to open up Council meetings to the public when you are legislating so we can see what you are doing ? #% So far , I have not seen much action in winding the programme up . #% But because we do not have that -- at least not to any great extent -- we need the flexibility for our businesses to be able to cope . #% My final point : others have mentioned the importance of reviewing what citizens should be entitled to . #% We have already come a long way in opening the Council to the light of day , but we must go still further and I therefore welcome the thrust of this report . #% We should be saying to our Commissioners that we want them to come back after 8 October to give a statement to the House , to inform us what the Member States are now saying on information society and information technology developments . #% Given that such a policy may be implemented , this report appears at an inopportune moment . #% So far , for those citizens in Guantanamo Bay , there is little to show for this . #% I hope that her colleague will report the strong feelings of the House on that matter . #% Mr President , it is an honour to present this report on Iraq to Parliament this evening . #% That seems sensible and would make our acts much more comprehensible to the public . #% I see no reason why accession negotiations should not be closed during the summer before the conclusion of the Irish presidency and before the mandate of the present Commission ends . #% Visas are often a major source of income for developing countries , so that is not something that we can support . #% Far too much time is spent playing hide-and-seek , trying to work out what the Commission is actually proposing and why it is proposing to do it . #% Madam President , I took particular note of that part of the proceedings . #% Yet if those same critics look to the issue of climate change they will find that such cynicism is unwarranted . #% We worked on a formula that allowed us to consider avoiding the Solvency II discussions , which would come later . #% However , what he does not talk about , of course , is the fact that this summit will discuss the European Constitution . #% Member States have agreed most of the common asylum policy , but have lowered standards of protection to do so . #% Sixthly , we want the Member States and the port state control authorities in particular , to convey the information to the Commission so that the Commission can do its job in making sure the amended directive is uniformly implemented across the European Union . #% Quite frankly , if those are necessary , those countries should probably not be coming into the European Union at that point . #% Which of the main beneficiaries of the CAP are arguing for further reform ? #% Similarly , let us not set jobs against health . #% My specific question is this : one of the things on which research is urgently needed is the efficacy of vaccination in outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease . #% I should be extremely grateful for a response from the Presidency upon these questions . #% Does the President-in-Office agree with me that economic sanctions against Israel would in fact inflame the situation ? #% 
Mr Blair made it clear yesterday that he will support the US in a war on Iraq , without waiting until other options have been explored and without seeking a fresh UN Security Council resolution . #% There is some difficulty with Amendment No 25 . #% However , the EPLP is concerned that the proposals adopted by Parliament could have unintended consequences in countries which already employ a more complex set of maternity provisions . #% Mr President , the Commission document on health and safety at work is a good document . #% Mr Guellec clearly does not pick up simple messages from ordinary voters . #% Reports of this type help give us a snapshot of what is going on and of how we can do things better in the future , and this report sets out many of those lessons . #% Of course it makes sense not to reshuffle all the portfolios of the existing Commission just for a few months . #% Here an enormous amount of money is to be spent on chasing moonbeams , for the scientific evidence is very suspect , further discredited by the unscientific , emotional and theatrical way it is presented . #% The best thing that the Irish presidency could do , given its own problems with unemployment , is to tackle one section of the labour market . #% It must make clear to the security forces that any violations will not be tolerated and that perpetrators will be brought to justice . #% I am pleased to have seen confirmed today an improved proposal to deal with the crucial issues raised under the REACH report . #% The reference to the European Parliament 's opinion on the economic annual report was deleted by ECOFIN . #% However , having said that , it is important for the European Union ' s judicial area to have a coherent and comprehensive framework for dealing with the problems of counterfeiting and piracy which is widely carried out both within and without the Union by increasingly determined and technologically sophisticated criminals . #% Commissioner , thank you very much , that is very promising . #% I would like to thank very much the rapporteurs and members of the various committees who have given such thorough and urgent attention to the crucial issue that is before the House now . #% I was pleased that my amendments were accepted by the rapporteur as well as the full House today . #% There has been no progress in 5 months , and it 's unlikely we 'll see any soon , if ever . #% It will help make the world a safer place . #% I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours . #% It is fair to say that the only change I attempted to make to this report was to try to merge Paragraphs 6 and 8 to make it more coherent . #% For that matter , why should we , as regulators , discriminate between different forms of content other than to cost added value , protect copywrite and provide security when the boundaries between the traditional forms of content break down ? #% The fact that we have EUR 100 billion of outstanding commitments should be a problem for all the Community 's institutions . #% The Commissioner said that this is perfectly safe and it has worked very well with white meat . #% I share with Mr Kułakowski the regret that the Presidency of the Council does not , apparently , regard this debate today as important enough to command the presence of a minister . #% For this reason we welcome the proposals to improve information-sharing between relevant authorities , which are foreseen under Mr Duquesne 's report . #% in writing . - I support a more open gaming environment in Europe . #% As Mrs Hoff 's report shows , only Georgia , with former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the helm , has managed to hold free and fair elections and resist a lurch to authoritarian methods . #% My group would certainly agree with Mrs Cerdeira Morterero that we should use the existing system of contact points in the European Judicial Network , as it is pointless to keep reinventing the wheel with different systems of contact points for various initiatives . #% The tragedy of our Union is that , through too many people 's eyes , it has become an elitist project , pushing its ideology onto an increasingly sceptical public , according to Eurostat information . #% Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation . #% In addition to measures which enabled redeployed staff to perform other higher priority activities , we also proposed that explicit termination of service arrangements should be made available so that over a two-year period the Commission could offer reasonable severance conditions to 600 officials whose skills are not easily adaptable to the changed and changing needs and tasks of the institution . #% The peace agreement offered improved conditions to only a very small number of the RUF hierarchy . #% . -- Mr President , Azerbaijan became independent after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , but has lost 16 % of its previous territory in a short-lived war over the ethnic Armenian territory of Ngorno Karabakh with neighbouring Armenia and must now support some 570 000 internally-displaced persons . #% As recently as July , for example , the Knesset approved Amendment 5 to the Civil Wrongs Law . #% Indeed , some political delegations in this House have never voted in favour of nondiscrimination measures . #% We are about to get an avalanche of new laws because of this Lisbon Treaty and there is no question in my mind that there has to be a full , free , fair referendum in the United Kingdom to decide whether we stay part of this Union or not . #% I urge you , Commissioner , take the lead . #% First of all , I applaud the very speedy and accurate work done by Parliament 's staff in producing verbatim versions of speeches in this Chamber . #% However , there is a world of difference between agreeing that something is a problem and agreeing with a proposed solution . #% Mr President , I too would like to ask you to send a message to the President of the United States , Mr Bush , and to the United Kingdom Prime Minister , Mr Blair , recognising the remarkable achievement that , after only two weeks of war , we are now beginning to see the long-suffering Iraqi people being freed from one of the bloodiest tyrants in the world today , and with such a low level of civilian and military casualties , all things considered , in view of the enormity of the task involved . #% Defining the values and principles underlying public broadcasting gives us some difficulties anyway , as Member States , corporations , and broadcasters all have very different ideas of what public broadcasting constitutes . #% Once we get the single currency on the road we must give every ounce of our political energy to making enlargement work for the benefit of the European continent . #% With one of they regions , we will be off like a long dog , and then our citizens can all take a fuller part in the integration of Europe ' . #% Should they be adopted , businesses which have worked hard to become the best performing and most competitive in Europe would be compromised and threatened . #% We are , after all , trying to influence the document that will go to the European Council this week , but in practice I assume that has already been written , finalised , translated into 20 different languages and our impact in this Chamber is likely to be somewhat limited . #% Food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days . #% We clearly recognize the difficulties in some industrial sectors in reducing the use of VOCs or changing to effective alternatives and consequently we have allowed a generous time-limit for compliance , which we believe will give adequate time for the necessary change to take place . #% I have ignored the comments , the amendments that talk about war . #% Mr President , as I stated earlier , I have a very short oral amendment to Amendment 5 that is acceptable not only to the rapporteur but also certainly to the PSE , ELDR and Green Groups . #% These disabled adults and children share the same need for employment and housing and in other areas of their lives which we seek to ensure through the rehabilitation process . #% Hamas claims it is a legal actor observing the Geneva Conventions and therefore he is a prisoner of war , but Israel , in my view rightly , regards him as an abductee from the moment he was seized . #% The whole issue of doping in sport has recently received much greater attention , which is important . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , paragraph 7 - the final paragraph - instructs you to forward this resolution to the Commission , the Council and those other illustrious bodies , including the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee , and the social partners but , unusually , does not instruct you to send it to the parliaments of Member States . #% We are going to get to a situation where the budget of the common agricultural policy does not fit the size of the new European Union . #% Sadly , the Gaulieder example demonstrates that , to date , they have not arrived at that position . #% I am sure that we all believe in justice : justice for suspected criminals and justice for the people we represent ; and human rights for suspected criminals but also human rights for all our constituents . #% When the kidnapped person is himself a journalist , it is our responsibility to cherish their fate as they cherish others ' . #% Finally , I am ashamed that in this debate the British National Party will speak for the first time , with an MEP who last Friday described Islam as ' a cancer that should be removed from Europe by chemotherapy ' . #% That is what we are looking for from guidelines . #% Fewer crop sprays , for example , would benefit the environment if we grew GMO crops that did not need so many crop sprays . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be able to speak in this debate on European Union cooperation with Bangladesh , a country I know well , a country I was proud to visit with the European Parliament 's delegation in the autumn of 1998 . #% Fines should only be used as an additional measure to prison sentences since otherwise they could lead to the belief that you can somehow pay your way out of a criminal offence . #% We should project these standards in our international agreements because there are some worrying developments . #% We need to be expansive . #% Will anti-dumping duties continue to be provisionally imposed during that consultation period until we finally get a decision ? #% As both the minister and the Commissioner have said , this follows on from the Gyllenhammar High Level Group following the Vilvoorde closure by Renault . #% 
It does seem cruelly difficult in a sense that the way the enlargement process is presented is merely a question of conforming to some technical acquis , ignoring , perhaps , the specific difficulties that the Baltic Republics and other Central and Eastern European countries faced under the Soviet system . #% Whilst it is to be commended that we try and move forward in it , I have concerns that international adoption does bring risks - risks that have already been mentioned , such as child abuse and malpractice , that undermine the welfare of the child . #% It can not be denied that part of the motivation for the Commission 's interest in this is that many , Mr Chirac included , resent the fact that the lingua franca of business throughout the world , and indeed the European Union , is English . #% Certainly it is fair to say that generally , Member States and this Parliament too often skate around the important issue of employment . #% The word Afghanistan translates correctly into the words ` the land of sorrow and suffering ' . #% They were given a mass of bureaucracy -- in a foreign language -- through which they had to wade . #% We must make sure that when we come to Mrs Pack ' s report later this week we take the right decisions and that the Council understands Parliament ' s feelings on that . #% We have made some suggestions that are reflected in the question tonight . #% Some of the fallout is probably reflected in the new framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament , notably that if Parliament were to withdraw its confidence in any Member of the Commission , the President will either sack that Commissioner or come before Parliament and explain why not . #% Now that is clearly a fraud on the French taxpayer as well as a fraud on the European citizens . #% Lastly , Mr Prodi , will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU ? #% We must therefore vote for the fund to be used appropriately for other Member States . #% Something must be done on an ambitious scale . #% The nationals of those countries who rejected it will be told to vote again because they did not understand that it was compulsory . #% Some this morning will detect the whiff of hypocrisy ; but it is not actually hypocrisy , it is the smell of fear : fear that public support for the whole EU project will finally collapse if Turkish entry is pursued . #% It is perhaps hard to register that everything that has been going on has really only taken place in the last ten days or so , since the state of emergency was declared . #% We in Parliament are dismayed and I am sure others must be too , that the visa restrictions have not yet been lifted . #% We must redouble our efforts to help . #% Residents of Greenland working at the American base at Thule immediately set out across the ice with husky teams to get to the downed plane , the Americans desperate to get there before anyone else . #% Until those conditions are satisfied , I can not specify a date for a final decision in the College . #% I strongly support my colleague Mr Whitehead . #% Without that , in an international setting , we can not detain some of the worst criminal elements that go around the world . #% Will you ask why instances of forced disappearance , extrajudicial execution and sexual abuse have been excluded from that law . #% EURES has an important role for them and it is a great pity that employment and employers ' organisations are not more involved in the development of these services . #% Whilst the EU has struggled to consistently and systematically promote a coherent view of human rights , this Parliament has been praised by NGOs for the positive impact of the revival of the Subcommittee on Human Rights . #% Political parties are the only vehicle I am aware of which can make that connection , that bridge , between the citizen and the decision that has been made . #% We are now receiving loads of assurances and promises from the Council and from the Commission . #% An IGC that failed to amend the way the treaties can be revised in future and in policy sectors to soften them would be an IGC that threatened to paralyse the Union when it tries to modernise itself following the accession of new Member States . #% There are higher and higher levels of profit to be made illegally from public funds and there is a lower and lower rate of detection and , in some cases , risk of detection . #% Ten years ago , Namibia threw out the Spanish boats and took control over her 200-mile territorial waters . #% Our revised ambitions for Hong Kong must therefore not be a soft landing , but rather a springboard or , as Commissioner Mandelson has said , a platform for delivery early next year . #% That in turn leads to low-income countries , which leads to malnutrition , and that is the cycle we want to break . #% We would lose out largely on the prudent investor principle . #% They have been repeated today by a colleague who has since left and , as Mr Schmid will testify and the report shows , there is no evidence to substantiate them . #% I understood that we were to have a response from the Commissioner to the previous debate and that we would not just move on to the next debate . #% Mr President , the ELDR Group would like most sincerely to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her report and on the unanimity that it achieved in committee . #% We understand from the Peers Group report that you are going to be awarded an extra 92 posts . #% It was a word included , I believe , at the behest of the Council 's working party of experts . #% Lastly , these innovations can not progress unless there is a loosening of bureaucratic regulations . #% Mr Prodi visited Côte d'Ivoire in November and he made serious pledges on these issues . #% We are not prepared to let people get away with some of the activities they have got away with in the past . #% Now , strictly , that is contrary to Rule 125 of the Rules of Procedure . #% Can I make clear the very point that we were trying to make yesterday . #% If you book a charter with a holiday company you are covered by the package travel directive . #% Today we have more patients who are better informed than ever before - that is a good thing . #% Mr President , just because abortion in Portugal is illegal in most cases , it does not mean that it is not needed there . #% If we do not , it may be too late on all counts . #% I also welcome a number of the specific country statements in the draft resolution , including our strong call for the dismantling of paramilitary groups in Columbia . #% Mr President , ` Egypt : where everyone wears a smile ' is the slogan advertising Egypt to the world . #% Equally , I urge the wider world to recognise that this burning issue between two nuclear powers deserves external input to facilitate dialogue between the stakeholders . #% I will return to the UK position later . #% Whilst I understand perfectly the advances you have made and I am grateful for that , I am dismayed that this is not being communicated at the farm gate back in the country where I come from . #% Why work here , if you then face racism and xenophobia ? #% The EU sanctions have been poorly applied , with the Minster of Police recently attending an Interpol function in Spain and Mugabe attending a hunger conference in Rome , which is a clear affront to world opinion . #% As we know from our own Member States we have failed in recent years to do that . #% Thank you , Commissioner Frattini . #% At least we get some idea of the full picture . #% Firstly , the culls were carried out in accordance with legal provisions and in full consultation with the European Commission . #% A company that will not ensure in its total delivery the highest standards it often claims in its annual reports , is hypocritical and endangers the lives of workers and the public . #% We hear claims from the manufacturers , intent as they are with stuffing their pockets with gold and making sure that farmers across the globe are locked into their supply chain . #% However , it is clear from the Irish programme that with or without the Constitution , this presidency intends to pursue a deeply integrationist agenda . #% How many more reports do we have to read about gross violations of human rights ? #% I am heartily sickened to read the passages about how many millions are to be aside for bodies that are -- to quote the jargon -- ` active at European level ' or ` information relays ' . #% I also welcome the passing of Committee Amendment 66 , which will allow funding for stem cell research where it is approved by Member State law and subject to strict controls . #% Our citizens are bored , they are uninspired and the mission of building a new Europe has little resonance with them now . #% We will be voting for Amendment 64 ; we think it is very important to send a signal that healthcare matters . #% 
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum . #% But would the Council be in favour of repealing Article 296 of the EC Treaty , in other words , disallowing the exemption from the single market provisions and so introducing competition into defence procurement ? #% in writing . - There are several reasons why this agreement strengthens the EU internal market and cooperation in standards as well as maintaining consumer protection . #% So we are recommending a rehabilitation agenda . #% I believe that we should do this at second reading , once we have received the common position from the Council and we know what Parliament 's amendments were at first reading . #% Firstly , on the one hand we have under-utilisation of funds , where clearly , with the balance recovered by Member States now amounting to EUR 15 billion for the 2001 financial year , as Mr Färm points out , there is a significant financial and political problem , especially as regards insufficient payments in the Structural Funds . #% There is really no need to wait three years until the Commission comes up simply with proposals . #% I must say that it contains a number of significant steps forward . #% Secondly , they very often act as a perverse incentive . #% in writing . - I do not understand how a Parliament that has called for the lifting of Israel 's economic blockade of Gaza can today have voted in favour of a report intended to increase our cooperation with that country . #% It is only by challenging the key free trade model that we can really make sure that all workers in the world have the chance to earn a decent livelihood . #% I do not want an EU representative to speak for my country at the WTO . #% The northerners claim that they are being disenfranchised and are continuously being discriminated against by the elites -- as they see them -- in the South . #% Whether it be regulation by that way or by means of so-called new soft-law methods , again Parliament needs to be fully and properly engaged in the process . #% You will be aware that over the last few part-sessions in Strasbourg there have been any number of serious problems with flights to and from Strasbourg airport . #% The amendment details the ` advice which may be used in the preparation of specifications for a specific procurement ' , that is to say , it effectively sets parameters for a call to tender . #% We see this through the absurd Comitology committees which operate in Brussels . #% It will improve the investment returns to existing pension schemes and thereby improve pensions . #% I hope that other groups , even those for whom it is not their preferred amendment , will nonetheless rally behind this as an acceptable compromise and a workable one , which our Union would be wise to take on in its new Constitution . #% It is already an embarrassment . #% Does he personally think it is a good idea ? #% We have not begun to tackle the risks of this , so we need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the United States and what profiling techniques are being used . #% They all concerned our constituents and exercised our legislative minds . #% I was the chairman of the European Parliament ' s Committee of Inquiry into the growth of racism and fascism in Europe back in 1986 , when our rapporteur , Mr Evregenis , proposed such legislation . #% Member States now have a wider discretion as to how they control the outbreak and the sequence to be followed in emergencies , from stamping out to vaccination . #% It will only be reversed or limited if domestic political pressures dictate that should be the case . #% The first thing we had to do was try to get an agreement on the flexibility instrument for the rebuilding of Kosovo . #% Cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old . #% Well , before there was the Lisbon Treaty , there was the Lisbon Strategy , and in the Lisbon Strategy , the EU intended , and I quote , ` to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world ' . #% This is a good day for sensible legislation . #% Therefore , President-in-Office , the good news in your speech is that you are seeking an urgent meeting to review the situation yet again . #% I appreciate that there will have to be an authorisation and monitoring system , but this will show the real needs of people and deliver the flexibility we should aim for . #% I would like confirmation that this was accurate or has Conservative policy on that changed ? #% And so , in conclusion , Mr President , Finland with its great strength in computers and communications is ideally placed to lead us . #% Where has that ever got anyone ? #% I had the honour of leading the ad hoc delegation to Bosnia some weeks ago . #% I hope that will come forward in the coming year and give us a permanent legal base . #% Just a few minutes from here , a great Belgian flag was proudly flying this very day -- and rightly so -- under the Cinquantenaire . #% I would add that this should also relate to the question of whether the principle is being complied with , not just overall by Member States , but at regional levels within them . #% Mr President , the rapporteur spoke with great passion and great conviction about the issues involved in social exclusion . #% Vessel owners have received EU compensation ; but the people who worked on the decommissioned boats in the UK did not even receive statutory redundancy pay , let alone EU compensation , because they were designated casual workers even if they worked on the same ship for many years . #% Parliament must call for an active end to the recruitment of health workers . #% There are many constructive suggestions in this resolution . #% That is why we have put in Annex V of our Rules that we needed not just a simple majority but also a special majority of Members of the House - an absolute majority - to refuse discharge , because otherwise the refusal of discharge could have been a backdoor way to censure the Commission by a smaller majority than that normally required under the Treaty . #% If that is the case , and I believe it to be the case , then why have you come forward with nothing but a blank sheet for us today ? #% We welcome Tunisia 's record of promoting economic and social reform , notably on the position of women and the right to education , but we need to continue to work with Tunisia on a number of human rights issues and see progress made , particularly in the areas of the right to expression and association . #% The fact remains that , as things stand at the moment , any danger of breaching Heading 5 of the financial perspective emanates entirely , solely and completely from the ambitions of institutions other than the Commission and has absolutely nothing to do with the modest and temporary proposals that we make for additional investment associated with reform , which is a fundamental mission of the Prodi Commission , given to us by the overwhelming majority of this House and the unanimous decision of the European Council . #% The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters , the paedophiles and the pornographers , than to industrialists . #% I would like to commend Mrs Cederschiöld on the way that she has incorporated so many of the opinions of different committees into a very comprehensive report and also to congratulate the Commission on this initiative . #% The President-in-Office was a very distinguished Member of this Parliament so he is therefore able to express an opinion , by his own words , on the state of the Council now . #% Many lives have been lost , thousands of kilometres of our coastline have been damaged , perhaps for ever . #% Mr President , my attendance is not recorded even though , as you know , I was here because I sat in the Bureau with you for two hours . #% We should not be trying to tie the hands of national governments in managing their own economies . #% It concerns the issue of the regulation which is shortly to come in which will enable airline pilots between the ages of 60 and 65 to fly freight traffic throughout Europe , with one exception . #% However , we also need to question whether we are using the law we have effectively and fairly in accordance with international human rights obligations . #% I think we have to look at the overall take of fish -- not just what has been caught inshore , but also what has been taken further out to sea -- because , whether we like it or not , there is a limited number of fish and the future of inshore fishing relies greatly on adding value to the fish that is caught . #% Secondly , on a matter of communication , under paragraph 21 of this resolution , I would like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all Commission and Parliament offices in the Member States to work together within a European House framework by 1 January 2000 . #% Mr President , it is a red herring to say that we can not get effective EU action on crime , terrorism and civil liberties without a new Constitution . #% The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome : dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society , and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller . #% We all wish for and are committed to a comprehensive overhaul of the common agricultural policy , but this is more likely to happen in a thorough and systematic way if reforms of other sectors are considered as part of a general package in 2006 , and besides , there is no absolute guarantee that an earlier ending of the sugar regime would necessarily deliver immediate cheaper sugar prices to the consumer . #% This report leaves open the question of the Gibraltarian vote . #% No new preconditions , no further delays . #% Therefore , I do not try to pretend that we have done more than we have . #% I hope that the Commission might look again at another physical agents directive , the electromagnetic fields directive , and how it will affect MRI scanners , in terms of bringing in static magnetic fields . #% That was quite clear and I notice that a number of my colleagues made an effort to be here at 10.30 . #% Secondly , we would like to see action to ensure that all containers are correctly weighed in port and correctly stowed before a ship sets sail for sea , as well as fitting automated beacons to aid container location . #% 
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work . #% This more than ever is the right time to concentrate our efforts and bring this programme to a timely conclusion . #% The issue of in-use compliance testing is a particularly thorny one . #% However , we express our disappointment that the legal services of the institutions prevented elected MEPs from tabling more far-reaching amendments to this controversial piece of legislation . #% UKIP strongly believes developing countries would be better served by agreements with individual nation states . #% Here there are three examples that I would like to mention where I believe the conditions for release and the policy for reserve use have actually been helpful in strengthening Parliament 's position in the budget process . #% Mr President , what is ridiculous is that this Chamber , which is a political organisation , calls a state by an acronym . #% Third , will he undertake to bring forward a detailed operational relationship between the rapid reaction facility and the financing of ECHO and indeed explain why he has not at one and the same time brought forward proposals to speed up our humanitarian assistance as part of the reform programme which he knows we support . #% I am urging colleagues to accept duality , at least in the immediate future . #% We have many slaughterhouses and meat processing plants that discharge effluent into domestic sewage systems in our major towns . #% The European Union failed to take a united stand on Guantánamo Bay . #% I want the amendment in the name of my group - Amendment No 33 - to stand . #% We know that we have to be realistic . #% I have followed the situation in Sudan for many years and I can confirm that would not be realistic at this time in particular . #% We can have the technology to give people complete control . #% He said he was very relieved to hear that and would now get on with it . #% in writing . - Despite the request for a budget increase which I opposed and voted against at the committee stages , I nonetheless fully support the Report on the European Year of Volunteering overall . #% I note especially the proposal for , and I quote , ` an EU-wide uniform size labelling system for clothing and footwear ' . #% I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and in particular the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality -- with whom we had enhanced cooperation , both officially and in practice -- for their valuable opinions and for the many ideas they have also contributed to this report . #% I would also like to assure colleagues that he did not write the text of my speech this morning , any more than I did the text of his speech yesterday on my report . #% As a liberal I am opposed to quotas . #% We need you to stick to your brief . #% At its worst , we want to avoid the possibility that the aims of the structural funds and the European Union 's concern to protect its natural habitats may collide . #% The problem is that subsequently I received a letter from the Labour Party Whip , threatening disciplinary action . #% Notwithstanding Mr Posselt 's angle on this question , and the Council 's response -- neither of which I disagree with -- would the President-in-Office agree that , sadly , forced prostitution , child prostitution and trafficking in human beings are all also consequences of and an inevitable feature of poverty-ridden states which lack better economic opportunities . #% Just yesterday we had armed Eurocorps soldiers carrying the European flag round the courtyard outside , a sort of European Union version of trooping the colour . #% That access provision is the key concern of colleagues . #% I am also concerned by contradictory statements within the government about migration . #% This report calls on the Council of Ministers to be more open in its decision process . #% Once more , I welcome the fact that we have all worked together to secure that particular achievement . #% What has happened to the laws of supply and demand between sellers and European citizens and consumers ? #% I ask the PPE-DE Group to join with us , to explore the possibilities and reach a sensible compromise with the Council , recognising the modern world and affording equal rights to all of our citizens , not equal rights for some . #% Related to that , we continue to oppose the Massachusetts Federal laws which impose very effective sanctions on Burma . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Members present I should like to say how delighted we are that our colleague Mrs Read is back with us after an illness , fully restored to health and in her customary eloquent style . #% Firstly , after 1 July Hong Kong will no longer be a solely British issue , it will become a concern for the whole of the European Union . #% That might be a working method we might well need to employ in the Convention and is something we can draw some lessons from . #% She will see that it is her knowledge of the industry which is prehistoric and not the plant that is operating . #% Governments need to do what is necessary to address this . #% I think this mix-up has been due to a misunderstanding between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain , who thought there were only sixty incinerators of this type when in fact there are several thousand . #% This country is now so extreme and medieval that paper bags are banned in case they contain pulped versions of the Koran and women are veiled , segregated from men and unable to work at all . #% In order to do that , we must start by getting away from endless discussions about processes and start talking about outcomes and policies . #% However , once every possible opportunity for negotiation was exhausted - and every possible opportunity was exhausted - then military action was inevitable and should be supported by this House . #% The rapporteur 's amendments seek to ensure that those requirements are met and that responsible care is exercised by all the practitioners in this field . #% They can be won over - but by anyone . #% The text is a compromise , but it has been accepted by all parties , including the reinsurance industry . #% The question for our second reading is : how is this to be financed ? #% First , they must learn that rich countries can no longer get something for nothing . #% Furthermore , I support US aims to rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein . #% In the 2004 Madrid bombings , no emails were sent by terrorists ; instead one wrote a draft on Yahoo , and his accomplices logged on and read it . #% At the time , Parliament decided to work closely with the Commission in establishing a programme to promote democracy and human rights , primarily in Central and Eastern Europe , but also in those countries close to us and in the wider world , and to put the whole process onto a more systematic basis . #% The Chinese Government has given a clear commitment to uphold the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration , and I would certainly not wish to question the sincerity of that commitment . #% For the last three years the flexibility instrument has been the main aspect of the budget and it has overshadowed everything else . #% While I am on my feet , I would like to add an oral amendment presented to me by Mr Ebner , which I fully support . #% As usual , there is an ulterior motive at work here : it appears that disaster relief is to be politicised . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the European Union has , in my country and elsewhere too , a richly deserved reputation for taking its decisions furtively , secretly and surreptitiously . #% I was also struck by the arrogance of the Commissioner in demanding that other countries , such as China and Japan , abolish the death penalty if they want to have relations with the EU . #% I also agree with Commissioner Nielson that we need a constructive EU policy towards Cuba . #% She did perhaps more than any western political statesman of our age in confronting the Communists and bringing about the collapse of the Iron Curtain . #% I say I hope that will be the case because the deadline for amendments on this dossier closed only a few minutes ago . #% I guarantee you now there will be no IAA if Annex XV goes into the treaties unamended or without any guarantees that Parliament 's rights can be maintained . #% It is because politicians consistently spend more money than they raise in taxation - more money than they can possibly raise in taxation - , most of which , in point of fact , they actually waste . #% In radio circles , they say that the biggest crime is to say nothing into the microphone . #% Mr President , those of us who were in Abuja and Kano last year for the ACP meeting welcomed President Obasanjo 's move from military dictatorship to democracy . #% In fact , in the last few days , there have been troop deployments by the Burmese in support of Burmese attempts to construct a dam on the Naf river close to the Bangladesh border , sixty miles south east of Cox 's Bazar . #% The protection of geographical indications is a good idea . #% Finally , I am pleased to hear the Commission and the Council mention the needs of the developing world . #% 
I understand the situation with China very clearly and I would accept your position , but one of the things that we are trying to do in the Western world at the moment is make poverty history . #% We were told that we supplied observers that were crucial to the success of the referendum when the East Timorese said a very loud and very large `` yes '' to independence . #% We can not go on adding burdens of this kind on the small enterprises which are the great creators of jobs . #% My questions to the Commissioner , which she might like to consider answering either now or later at some time , are , first : does she not agree that the situation in this directive proves the need for a much more thorough impact assessment to accompany legislation such as this ? #% We are now demanding to know what aspects in each failing Member State of each directive have not been enacted . #% Egypt is instrumental in helping us in that task . #% I do not believe that Spain , or Italy , or Germany , or any of us should face the prospect of legal sanctions because they are being polluted from China . #% It is not a good idea to condemn one Member State for action taken in good faith by a democratically elected government . #% Furthermore , I firmly believe that the consumers will be able to orient themselves better if the name of the Member State in which the product has been produced is evident . #% As rapporteur , I would have liked both the Council and the Commission to move a little further towards our position as adopted at first reading . #% As the UK business grew , we invested in more people , as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery . #% We could argue all day about which beef is the safest , but the fact is that once labelling is in place the consumer will be able to decide . #% co-rapporteur . - Mr President , first of all I should like to thank Mrs Flautre for her very hard work and that of her staff in recent months in trying to bring this instrument to the point where we can adopt it by the end of this year . #% I am proposing to table an amendment on that because , as the rapporteur knows , this is a subject particularly dear to the heart of UK Conservatives . #% Mr President , I congratulate my friend and colleague Mr Arvidsson on attempting to make sense of this draft directive . #% I would be grateful if the Commission could look into these allegations , in particular to see whether this breaches the plant health directive , because , clearly , the disease has now crossed the border . #% We therefore have to send out a very clear message that we remain committed to the permanent restoration of peace and stability in the region . #% It is scandalous , for example , that there has been toleration for so long of large stockpiles of weapons held by terrorist organisations such as the IRA in one EU Member State , in order that it may threaten or carry out attacks in another . #% The Council must reaffirm its conviction , as it has done , that the negotiated two-state solution is the only one that will bring peace and security , but that means that the EU itself must live up to its responsibilities . #% Nevertheless , the world is a complex place and a number of issues remain relative rather than absolute . #% It is regrettable that Canada is blocking the EU in retaliation for the Union 's ban on seal products , and I hope that , eventually , common sense will prevail . #% Is it worth us losing our right to trial by jury ? #% There is extraordinary hypocrisy in demanding subsidy reduction and neo-liberal economic policies in the South while practising old-fashioned northern protectionism in the North . #% Mr Oostlander spoke of the official registration of partnerships with the government . #% We are all here aware of the importance of cooperation with the wider world , be it in liaison with the World Health Organization , UN agencies or third governments , particularly the United States . #% There is one channel in Europe that provides European information and yet , I have to tell Parliament that this is a channel that is on the verge . #% Frankly , it is an aspect of independence that the government has deliberately shunned by refusing to hold its own public inquiry in the UK . #% The rapporteur recognises this problem , but places too much faith in the availability and acceptability of non-animal tests . #% I should like to pick up on four points . #% The text of the statement makes it quite clear that the Data Protection Directive applies , because it states that US customs will access the data in the territory of the Community . #% A sum of EUR 162 million : it seems to be uncontentious , but it is hugely important on several levels . #% Secondly , idealistic political changes instituted by the political elites which do not have the broad support of the people will be like structures built on sand . #% Thirdly , the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies is crucial for the enlarged Community . #% Unfortunately , with respect , it shows an enormous ignorance of what actually happens to wine in those countries that it is shipped to . #% That is not to suggest that we should somehow weaken our position in relation to our demands on the countries . #% Many of our parties in the European Union would not be able to register that level of support ! #% If we handle it well , it will greatly strengthen the Union . #% Consideration of those features could then take place properly in the early months of 2003 . #% An annual medical check is the best way forward . #% Member States must try to do more to integrate refugees into society . #% Mr Andrey Tsimaylo , the deputy chairman of Media-Most , was yesterday arrested and subjected to five hours of interrogation , following which Mr Anton Titov , the financial director of independent television , was arrested at the home of his mother , the door having been broken in by the security police . #% Could it be deliberate policy that TVs are not there to ensure that members stay in the chamber rather than hang around in the bars watching the debates #% Under-representation of women has been commented on already , but I would ask you to recall the famous Loya Jirga , which was almost 100 % male . #% The benefits of regional integration , market access and integrated trade and development , as my colleague Mrs Martens said , are absolutely clear . #% I believe that the time is long overdue to echo the recommendation of the heads of the EU mission in Jerusalem and call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the grounds of human rights abuses , as provided for by Article 2 of that Agreement . #% I trust there will not be any decision that the public consultation - including with children - will be put on hold until a new Commission and Parliament is in place . #% Much of the report focuses on the European Union 's promotion of human rights and democratisation as part of its common foreign and security policy . #% The honourable Member might be interested to know that we have arranged , in cooperation with the Austrian presidency , a major conference on demography and the impact that it will have on the whole social fabric of the Union . #% Mr President , since 7 November the SNCF has suspended all cross-Channel rail freight services because of fears for the safety of its staff at Calais following threats from those seeking to enter the UK illegally . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action , although we would like to have seen it earlier . #% We should echo what Mr Mulder said and look on the events of the last few weeks as a turn for the better . #% I hope this will be put into place immediately because , otherwise , my health and other people 's health will suffer . #% I wish to comment on several items . #% Now , I am sad to say , if colleagues vote against this amendment , which is designed to achieve honesty , openness and transparency , they will have a hard job refuting those allegations this time . #% As has been noted , it is the eighth largest trading nation in the world and has the world 's largest container port . #% Certain members of staff make great efforts in this respect , and we would also pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino for the work and the vision that he is putting into this . #% So inclusion of all drivers is important , both on occupational health and safety grounds and on operational safety grounds . #% I wonder , do you see that as being something that the study will give us a clear response on ? #% A trade in human flesh , a cruel bargain with Saddam Hussein - for Saddam owned the Iraqi people 's every movement from tear-sodden cradle to early and unquiet grave . #% For too long , the terms and conditions of what constitutes a drug trafficking offence have been too woolly , thereby creating serious pockets of crime in some parts of the world and within the EU . #% We want recognition that neglected diseases are some of the biggest causes of disability . #% But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme . #% As Piet Hein Donner , the midwife of the programme , has said , the first principle is the implementation of mutual recognition as the fundament for judicial cooperation . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done on this report . #% One of the most memorable events in the recent Olympic Games was the case of the long-distance athlete who was likely to win , but was prevented from doing so by a member of the crowd simply running out and stopping him . #% I wish to offer my thanks , as rapporteur , to all those who have been concerned , not only on my own committee - the Committee on Citizen 's Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - but also on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport as well . #% 
You can show that although second-hand goods are , by definition , different from those that are purchased new , a different period of reflection and remedy suffices . #% At one time we never saw a Council minister here at this point in the budget process . #% The new rule , however , leaves no option but to abstain on certain reports . #% Mr President , we all recognise that many reforms need to take place in Turkey in order that its candidacy for the European Union can be taken forward as rapidly as possible . #% While it is not specifically targeted at the point you made , a wide-ranging general discussion will take place in October at that conference on the whole question as regards its impact on the Union . #% You were not able to come up with a plan at that Summit , and you can not bail out Greece without the International Monetary Fund coming in to save , at least for the moment , your euro dream . #% That is why I will vote against it and Mr Rocard 's version of it . #% Securing her borders as well as the provision of increased protection for the Iraqi people are both imperatives today . #% I urge President Musharraf , nevertheless , at the same time to ensure an end to cross-border terrorist infiltration and I welcome the news today of the arrest of those accused of attempting to assassinate him . #% This piece of work on the coordination -- not harmonisation , as some of my colleagues would like us to believe -- of social security systems has been lengthy . #% The debacle that Britain suffered during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 , is eloquent testimony to what happens when crises are managed by the EU . #% We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively . #% However , the key issue is that Member States need to prove their commitment to free movement by tackling problems openly and in a spirit which favours residents of the European Union . #% I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all may I wish Mr Van Rompuy and Baroness Ashton well in their new roles , and I hope they are able to establish templates for their posts which will endure . #% Mr President , following the launch of the accession process on 30 March 1998 in Brussels under the British presidency , EU enlargement is gathering ever greater pace . #% So why can we not consider a similar approach to the banana dispute as he has adopted to the hormone panel disputes ? #% The issue of flexibility is about who makes that decision . #% It is important because surveys show that one in three people visiting their doctors have a mental health problem but only one in six are diagnosed as such . #% No national government , I would suggest , could contemplate some of the spending increases that have been suggested for the 2007-2013 period . #% Let us all turn our attention to tightening up the hurdles which we need to leap over before we actually launch initiatives . #% I note what Mr Van Hecke said about the repatriation of a number of English football fans on C130 planes . #% The prize has been formal recognition for the very first time by the majority of MEPs that the European social model does indeed need to be reformed . #% Having said that , I thank the Commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other Members of the European Parliament 's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% It is important to keep it simple , to keep away from partial decoupling and to cut red tape . #% The overall aim of the directive is extremely important in ensuring that there is a consistent and high level of legal protection . #% This approach marks a significant departure from many previous transport-related proposals and is to be welcomed , although we must remain vigilant to ensure that the sector can continue to grow in a sustainable way without the kind of onerous red tape that , far too often , has characterised the Commission 's proposals . #% In December , Parliament sent a clear signal to the Council on eurobonds but there has been no constructive response from either the Council or the Commission . #% The case of Irina Petrushova with Respublika weekly , sentenced to one and a half years in jail is another example . #% In western Europe there is a serious demographic problem as the population grows ever older , with the birth rate continuing to fall in the leading industrial countries of the European Union . #% in writing . - This report recognises the reaction of global leaders that tax havens are a part of a global economy which should contribute positively to the wider interests . #% I also consider that Amendment No 10 might be regressive in some Member States , as it proposes a general condition governing entitlement to unemployment benefit . #% Mr President , as the Member who represents the constituency where this terrible atrocity took place , I want to thank you for the comments you have made on behalf of all the House . #% Strikes , diversions , cancellations and all sorts of other reasons have meant that MEPs have been seriously delayed or diverted . #% They look to us to help institute those freedoms and the fundamental freedom of human rights . #% I will try to be helpful to the President-in-Office by providing him with some arguments as to why this matter should be revisited . #% This mine , which was debated in the House last year , was seized by President Robert Mugabe and his cronies . #% This is no personal reflection on Commissioner McCreevy , but I am not satisfied that the Commission has given the proper answer . #% Kyrgyzstan is a poor , mountainous country with a predominantly agricultural economy , but it has carried out significant market reforms under ex-President Akaev . #% Despite everything the President-in-Office has said , I still think it is amazing that we allow these anomalies to continue . #% I think we are on the same wavelength here , and he knows that . #% Madam President , once again this year we have been struggling with the strict ceiling on category 4 , given ever-increasing demands arising from growing international instability and a consequent diminution of the poverty focus of EU aid to developing countries around the world . #% I know that Commissioner Liikanen 's motor vehicle colleagues will be well represented and are keen to come and exchange views with us , as are the motor industry trade associations and the European and Japanese component manufacturers , to have a look at how we handle this growing and important issue and how we relate to it politically . #% We know that the European Union is one of the world 's largest and most diverse importers and markets for wildlife products , with demands for pets , for fashion products , ornaments and medicines . #% Second , Amendment No 4 , which seeks to ensure that criteria for deciding a country 's eligibility for EU support and for evaluation of the projects will be defined in dialogue between the Community and partner governments or organizations . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Miranda , on bringing forward this interim agreement , allowing us to use the democracy and human rights clause before considering the full agreement . #% Perhaps the Turks will have to learn the hard way that membership of the European Union means losing control of your own destiny . #% This is a good report and the rapporteurs have worked really hard on it . #% That is why the British Labour delegation is hesitant about supporting the report . #% The proposals before us , passed after long deliberation by a large majority of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , have several ingredients . #% I have said for quite a long time that need not be the case . #% Mr President , I am not on the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety but , like Mr Bowis , I represent London , the city traditionally known as the ` Big Smoke ' . #% Will all the voices in the European political spectrum be heard ? #% We are in a global context here and e-commerce will continually throw at us clashes of legal systems and style . #% The recent Passover suicide bombing in Tel Aviv was publicly supported by the Hamas PA Government , which is an outrage . #% Lastly , I want to raise the tragic issue of international adoptions , which affects hopeful parents from the European Union , the United States and Israel . #% There is already a need for change to meet new environmental and social imperatives in the countryside and more precise targeting of what are huge public subsidies , away from already wealthy farmers towards more marginal European regions and production of the food we actually need . #% Some Member States , such as France , have been doing well , but the problem is that there is a divergent level of funding across Member States . #% The time for diplomatic niceties has passed . #% He quite rightly said - I tipped him off beforehand - that we will be abstaining on this . #% Parliament will be debating a report on the Eurodac Convention tomorrow and voting on it later . #% Our hope must be that this Commission initiative for a European Extra-Judicial Network will help build consumer e-confidence and force those European figures up . #% We should introduce a ban on the transport of live animals at the earliest possible moment . #% It is up to the industry to accelerate that search for validated alternatives . #% This House has criticised Pakistan 's exports of nuclear technology in the past and received condemnation from its government for doing so . #% This is a very small mouse that you have managed to produce so far . #% 
I believe that a harmonised asylum system will undermine the UK 's sovereign right to decide for itself who should and should not be allowed to claim asylum in my country . #% Delay is absolutely critical , because Galileo 's unique attractiveness to investors is lost once the American GPS 3 system has reached operational capability , which is estimated to be in about 2015 . #% In selling it to citizens and consumers alike , there is a simple message : by cutting energy use we can help them save money and we can all contribute to do our bit to save the planet . #% Asbestos is very often safe while it is covered . #% Firstly , it is important to say to the Commission that we in Parliament , having established this budget line , have adopted some important principles that we want to see adhered to in the way that it is implemented , strengthening our commitment to non-refoulement . #% That would mean that British animal charities , children 's charities , churches , educational foundations , research foundations and universities would not be able to speak to us as Members of this House . #% One of the proposals the Commission is making for modernising reform will extend access to certain family and social benefits to European Union officials who are currently denied such access because they can not or do not want to enter into conventional legal marriage under the laws of the Member States . #% I hope that the President of the Ecofin Council , when he presides over the Finance Ministers on Monday , encourages all his colleagues , to engage in a similar debate in their own national parliaments because that is the way we can defeat the Euroscepticism in Europe that exists at the moment on the single currency , by having public debates in our own parliaments , our national parliaments , and ensuring that these issues are fully aired . #% I do not know who scores it - maybe the goalkeeper on the opposite side walks into the net carrying his own ball - but one way or another it is a draw ; a vital point is secured and relegation is avoided . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on behalf of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee , even though that was a very last-minute edition which I think exemplifies a lot of what is wrong at the moment with the way we think about sustainability within this institution . #% Peace and governance can not be dealt with through declarations such as NEPAD . #% All we are doing today is trying to add our voices to those of his parents and his colleagues , and to say to his kidnappers : realise that if anything happens to him , you will have lost a strong voice telling your story to the world . #% Clear proposals from the Commission would be received with great interest by members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy . #% It is , therefore , not a question of being ` Little Englanders ' but of countries with real international responsibilities being careful of what they sign . #% I welcome these measures . #% We regret the fact that this issue was unnecessarily brought before the House at this stage . #% The new vaccine will be an ` inactivated ' jab and will allay farmers ' fears over the traditional ` live ' vaccines . #% There have been exchanges of officials from the EU Member States , seminars on indirect tax issues of common interest , multilateral control of excise duties , development of common professional training across the European Union , including improving audit skills for the officials concerned , and , significantly , development of language training . #% We have sacrificed this in order to get an agreement , which is a more cooperative approach and would mean that we work together in cooperation . #% Madam President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Sakellariou on a very comprehensive report . #% Can we not rebody Vectras at the Ellesmere Port plant in my constituency ? #% The EU has a responsibility to see that its citizens are well informed . #% So we do need an EU mechanism for enforcement which , from now on , will be provided by Commission infringement competence and European Court of Justice supervision . #% We are not hamstrung by compliance with the Schengen Agreement , yet we have no idea who enters or leaves our country and at least half a million illegal immigrants should not be there in the first place . #% Stem cell research will then bring relief to millions of Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and diabetes sufferers , some of them known to us personally and some in fact colleagues in this House . #% It can surely be no coincidence that , since the Labour Government ' s brave decision in May 1997 , Britain has enjoyed a previously unknown period of economic stability and been praised by the OECD . #% That has to be welcomed . #% There is insufficient response to the PKK ' s ceasefire . #% We have all the problems which Mrs McCarthy has outlined . #% This both assists British business and helps with the completion of the Single Market . #% We have to bring children up the agenda . #% As you know , I have not always been one of your biggest supporters , but I have to concede you have done very well . #% We are now moving as fast as we can , but there is no way that we can move as fast as the rapporteur 's amendments prescribe . #% After all , the 1999 Nigerian Constitution guarantees total freedom of belief , and the country has signed international convenants on human rights . #% The CAP reform is now moving towards offering help for farmers to help themselves . #% What use are our agreements , in particular the human rights clauses , if we do not enforce them ? #% We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , ` necessarily with acute vigilance ' . #% You are to be congratulated on the work that you have done . #% Consequently we need to ensure that the containment and safety measures taken are appropriate to the risk of the micro-organism . #% The Commission have mentioned this in their text in a very clear way and we want to make sure that the monetary authorities in Europe , particularly the European Central Bank , address this point too . #% However , if I lived in a developing country I would be less fortunate . #% I do not believe that we can go on with that and my personal view is that now is the time . #% It is very important that we see this in the broad framework of recognising stable partnerships as he described it in the November 2000 discussion paper . #% We now must look to the future and make sure we provide ACP countries with adequate financial support for their restructuring . #% Finally , I was condemned by my colleague , Glyn Ford , which I actually take as a compliment . #% If the Germans and others , for example , now have trouble with the habitats directive , why did we not hear more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament ? #% As the House will know , some stability has been achieved in the general financial situation in Russia since the dramatic fall in the international exchange value of the rouble in August last year . #% The recent reported death of 17 psychiatric patients from malnutrition and hypothermia in a hospital in southern Romania shows the severe problems faced by disabled people . #% They are particularly important in terms of job creation amongst disadvantaged groups in the labour market . #% I suspect that unless we do something that is in fact the case . #% Mr President , it seems to be becoming politically fashionable now to say that we can not afford to maintain the European model of social protection . #% I would like to support the rapporteur ' s recommendation that we defer the vote . #% Has anybody asked the bats ? #% I am all for the free movement of goods and services . #% The proposal for the European Protection Order which is being touted says it is about the protection of women . #% Finally , just like my colleague Mr Lehne , I have another meeting and I hope you will bestow your blessing on my leaving as you did on his . #% With such widespread consensus from regulatory bodies , it seems wasteful to divert the overstretched EFSA from meaningful work into an endless cycle of re-evaluation . #% You could possibly end the UK 's involvement , but you can not stop what the European Union is doing . #% Our experience from our discussions with the ECOFIN Council and the European Central Bank is that we are very much involved in a monologue . #% Madam President , we are not persecuting Mr Buttiglione , but trying to save European citizens from being led on justice issues by someone so eminently unsuitable . #% WEEE is the fastest growing waste stream in Europe and we simply have to have an adequate directive to deal with it . #% We recognise also that selling the euro to the citizens of the European Union is essential . #% Euro money was a key element in transforming the old Manchester docks at Salford Quays into a vibrant commercial centre , creating over 4 , 000 jobs . #% I would lastly express some reservations about Amendment No 11 . #% First of all , we need to get it right in our own countries . #% Whilst the British Government will spend what it takes to conform to your way of thinking , other Member States may view things very differently . #% 
On another level , there are still those who aim to inflict mass destruction on our democracies . #% This is disgraceful . #% There is 70 % unemployment and over 6 million people are in need of food aid . #% How much more concerned would they be if they realised the aims of some of their own politicians and legislators ? #% It would be unfortunate if our obsession with those first two great patriotic questions obscured the third -- the scope of QMV -- which is in some ways more important . #% It is only if they replace the proposals that I am less happy . #% We are going to have to adjust the programmes for financing , looking forward to seeing where our money can be best spent . #% This particularly applies to young people , pensioners and women who often face social and economic exclusion . #% That said , I hope that the House will be sufficiently impressed to know that my amendments were the only ones that went before the Committee . #% It was blocked , it appears , by the French Presidency , with no explanation of what was happening . #% While I am on my feet , I should also like to point out that not a single word on EU fraud and corruption published last month has yet been challenged or refuted . #% The compromise is to allow existing pesticides to continue until the end of their licensing period , but it will be banned in new pesticides . #% This unwanted and completely unnecessary tier of politicians is symbolic of the UK 's recent shift towards regionalisation . #% The only word to describe it is devastation . #% Madam President , on a point of order , I have here a report which appeared in the British newspaper The Independent concerning a meeting which appears to have taken place between yourself and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II . #% On the issue which divides this House , we insist that rape is a tool of war and therefore , access to full reproductive health rights has to be one of the human rights we defend in this report . #% Sending out this message undermines the EU commitment to the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs . #% Mr President , there is a saying in the United Kingdom that you should not ` spoil the ship for a ha ` porth of tar ' . #% Mr Duisenberg ' s remarks to us today are particularly welcome in that respect because he has promised that he that will do just that within the next year . #% Will the Council therefore clarify what its position on the OCTs is ? #% Paragraph 12 in particular refers to Galileo as being part of the European strategy and to its importance for transport . #% It is one of our aims in Europe to achieve common standards in the internal market . #% The longer this issue drags on , the more out of touch the European Union appears to be with its citizens . #% If we miss this moment , it will be lost for a generation and the cause of reform will be lost with it . #% Until action is taken to reverse the fall of commodity prices , poverty in Africa will not be properly addressed . #% Secondly , we should avoid trying to stretch the political credibility of the Union too far in taking on ambitions that the institutions themselves are incapable of handling at the present time . #% Mr President , today dockworkers have demonstrated against this measure outside this Parliament . #% This socialist report attempts to move the text in the wrong direction . #% I defy anyone to disagree with that . #% Without a new agreement with Europe , relations between Mexico would inevitably suffer in political , cultural and other spheres as well as commerce . #% The Liberal Group here sees it as only the first step in a series of measures which will lead eventually to the construction of a coherent , credible economic government . #% Mr President , this morning Parliament 's agenda was changed . #% Citizens from many Member States , including my own , but also Spain , Germany , Holland and Belgium , are having their legally acquired lands taken by local authorities without due process , which I am convinced is in breach of EU law . #% In the United Kingdom , the Parliament of which I also had the honour to be a member , is omnipotent and omnicompetent . #% That is all I want to say on the political aspects . #% Specifically however , we have voted against Amendments Nos 8 onwards . #% I would also endorse the points referred to by other Members about the need to use modern methods - e-mail and the Internet - to present petitions . #% There may be a legal interpretation as to when that disagreement was confirmed but , as far as we are concerned , it was confirmed at the conciliation meeting . #% It is also important that one of the achievements of IDABC is that it can give our citizens practical , very workmanlike examples of how the European Union , the Commission , Parliament , the Council have worked together to bring citizen-friendly benefits from the European Union to the Member States . #% On these points , what we have had before us this week fails to respect our Rules of Procedure and existing agreements reached between the two institutions . #% But do not be fooled into thinking that we are not prepared to take hard decisions if necessary . #% The Council will look seriously at any issues put forward by the European Parliament . #% It is on the issues outlined by many scientists and other observers that citizens are making up their minds to support climate change proposals . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by explaining to the House that the British Conservative delegation is going to abstain on Mr Lamassoure 's report , which , while it contains some excellent parts , also contains some parts which we can not accept . #% On this occasion I do not believe we are wrong to approach this matter in that way and I hope this Parliament will agree with me with a big majority . #% The solution is not to isolate liberals and liberal values and to take away those liberal values from the people of Pakistan . #% That can not be what you want . #% When are they ever going to learn ? #% I hope the Commission will give formal answers . #% Firstly , there are prior information and prior spending patterns . #% Reform of the sugar market is crucial to tackle over production and high prices on the EU market . #% Finally I would like to pledge the Commissioner our full support in the Committee on the Environment for whatever it is that she brings forward . #% Since that date , there have been many gross violations of individual rights . #% I accept that it is agreed minima to which we look , as there must be some room to align the penalty to the value of the catch and to penalise repeat offences more seriously than first offences , but I believe that we need greater uniformity in both the level of penalties and the type of penalties and procedures involved . #% Since the first publication of this directive back in 1997 the manufacturers have moved to meet the Commission standards . #% This Chamber has a responsibility to address the issue and if self-regulation is not going to work , it may well be that the European Parliament and the European Union will have to look at the issue and find a legislative solution . #% Nor should the adoption of general rules preclude the possibility of specific rules . #% UK citizens know and understand it and it should not be changed for an EU-wide system . #% The reality is that as we speak in this House , human rights abuses continue ; human rights defenders disappear . #% Furthermore , there is a danger that some essential oils would be removed from formulations , thus damaging the economic interests of some countries , including some very poor countries . #% I thank the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report and Mr Coelho for chairing the committee . #% But our citizens should be at the beginning , the end and at the heart of this process , helping us set the agenda , lobbying and informing us as we make decisions and overseeing how the results work . #% in writing . - As a fervent opponent of the EU and its continual meddling in our lives , I have consistently voted against the vast majority of reports that I have been asked to consider . #% Such an occasion as this is an opportunity to say that public health deserves a much higher priority in the EU within both the Commission and Member State governments as well as in the Parliament . #% The results of a comprehensive independent study published last April commissioned originally by the Commission showed that the European civil service pay scale is higher than that of national civil servants , similar to that of comparable personnel in other international organisations , significantly lower than that of similarly qualified expatriate employees of multinationals and lower than that of diplomats . #% The European Commission is quite right in its report to criticise lack of progress on employment for these disadvantaged groups within the Member States and to call for greater mainstreaming in our employment programmes linked to measures to combat discrimination . #% 
The major design characteristics of the Berlaymont have already won the International 2000 Passive and Low Energy Architecture Award for the best architectural design . #% That is perfectly taken into account in the deliberations we have had , which estimate that it may take another decade to reach the point and the conclusion that we all want . #% He should arrest and hand over those committing such acts to India for trial and justice . #% The European Ombudsman is independent and so we , as the Petitions Committee , do not interfere in the ongoing investigations of complaints . #% How many more hurdles do we want to invent to excuse inaction ? #% One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House . #% The sector in my own region provides 13 000 jobs in the north-east of England . #% I would like to remind the other committees that what we are trying to do , or at least what we and the Commission are trying to do is to ensure a legislative proposal is presented to Parliament and to the Council this year , hopefully between July and September , so that we can actually enshrine in legislation the amounts needed between now and the end of 2006 . #% We are exactly on the right lines as we are . #% They have taken up the task of working hard to get both countries into the Union , fighting corruption and human trafficking , addressing all the different issues regarding the free market , the rule of law and transparency : everything that has been mentioned so many times over the last six and a half years that is now coming true . #% I wonder if you would look at that issue and try to ensure that we have more staff on the ground in these units . #% I felt that his original version of one of the recitals was better than the compromise . #% I was interested that my colleague , Mrs Gill - unfortunately she is no longer here - made the point of support for market development to minimise regulation . #% Those generally short-term increases in security , based on national intelligence , should not have to be approved by the Commission before being implemented . #% Of course it is going to be exclusive as an invitation to Members if it is held on a day when Members are not in the place of work . #% I am saddened to say that there are reports of prisoners being removed from within the EU to outside countries , for evidence to be extracted by the use of torture . #% The same report showed that the efforts of most Member States to provide education and training to older age groups are still woefully inadequate . #% Secondly , I want to turn to something that the Irish Prime Minister , Mr Bruton , said about the role of government in trying to create jobs and boost the economy . #% We call upon both belligerents to cooperate immediately with the UN in seeking to establish the fate of the occupants of the UN planes which were shot down . #% Can I ask you , if we have time , to allow Mr Liikanen to answer my question ? #% In the United Kingdom they are all voluntary but in the United Kingdom , as we have heard , there is no plasma coming from UK donors for blood products because of the theoretical risk of variant CJD being transmitted by blood . #% I agree with the rapporteur that we need a European definition for affordability , and that means , as far as I am concerned , a formula we can apply to each Member State , in the light of its economic condition at any moment in time . #% Indeed we have a number of Commissioners who seem to be dealing with it , although Mr Liikanen is taking the lead . #% It will require unselfishness on the part of the Member States of the European Union and the applicant countries . #% I call on European negotiators to respect our resolution in favour of the principle of food security and for no adverse effect for developing countries in the agricultural negotiations . #% It would result in more carbon dioxide being produced in the refineries and also a 10 % increase in the price of fuel for farmers . #% What possible war could it have stopped ? #% It sounds like a lot of money , especially at a time when public finances are tight , but it is not unrealistic . #% Many opponents of this Constitution conjure up fears of a superstate ; many are opposed to the very existence of the European Union . #% We also need to be clear that we do not penalise those who carry out rescues , so we have no more Cap Anamur-style prosecutions . #% On ascending relatives , we consider that Amendment No 20 is superfluous because there is a general right in Article 9 of the proposal to apply a non-discriminatory means test to all entrants . #% We need a complete overhaul of the legislation framework in this area and I hope the Commission will move quickly in that respect . #% That would be a significant step towards the UK 's withdrawal from the European Union . #% We insisted in our resolutions that membership of the Human Rights Council should be open only to countries which issue standing invitations unimpeded to special rapporteurs . #% In the long run , that would also be bad for the Chinese people . #% On the basis of that scientific reality the feeling of the Commission and all other scientifically advised persons and bodies is that the evidence of uranium deposit in sea-water is such that the firing of shells for target purposes in the marine environment does not make any significant addition to uranium concentrations . #% The JPA continues to grow and flourish , nurtured as it is by our determination to increase our effectiveness and to ensure that both our political voice and that of the parliamentarians from the ACP countries are heard . #% Carriers must not be left alone ; the authorities have responsibilities too . #% In this respect , there has to be much in the way of compromise and this tends to disguise the differences which also exist . #% They are mostly boats from Spain , which has a fleet as big as the rest of the EU put together . #% Can we amend the joint text to the agreed word ` perspective ' ? #% The human rights of the one are not quite the same as the human rights of the other . #% The Union 's ad hoc observer status in the Arctic Council is inadequate for this purpose . #% It is not an exaggeration to say that this report represents a welcome new development in the way in which Parliament is working , in the way in which we are increasingly not only promulgating and amending legislation , but also developing a highly welcome preoccupation about how that legislation is subsequently implemented . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Council please give me some information as to whether it has made any progress on this matter ? #% Yet the experience of this clearly demonstrates that rules of origin are not an appropriate instrument to achieve that goal . #% I never cease to be amazed how much the price of newspapers varies across Europe . #% Protection of minorities through safeguards against discrimination , access to education in minority languages and preservation of minority cultures have always been an important element of EU conditionality in our relations with Croatia . #% I am not surprised at that - I know Anita Gradin very well - but until I have formal confirmation I can not release the letter . #% In these circumstances , I am recording my opposition to the final vote . #% His fellow Frenchmen rejected the EU Constitution , yet it is an essential ingredient of his report . #% The area that we would like to see you tackle is the question of youth unemployment . #% With goodwill and imagination this circle can be squared . #% If Hampton Court proved anything , it was that vacuums are dangerous when filled with hot air from politicians . #% The prospectus directive was published without much extensive consultation and it has taken us longer to resolve the issues as a result . #% The world listened too late to Caricom 's increasing anxiety , as so eloquently expressed by Louis Straker , Deputy Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines , at the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Addis Ababa a few weeks ago . #% It is not just about a fairer , more open trading system . #% This does not excuse the shelling of civilian targets , but it does put it into context and shows where the blame lies . #% Mr President , I wish I was making this speech in a Parliament based in Brussels rather than in this Chamber , since the ongoing Strasbourg circus , now exacerbated by financial scandal , brings our House into disrepute . #% But Turkey is a country of great value to Europe . #% To assist that process , the European Parliament should , as soon as we reassemble , set up a special relationship with the North Cypriot Parliamentary Assembly . #% Mr President , every year 100 people die in my West Midlands constituency of asbestos-related diseases . #% The Renaissance , spanning the 14th to 17th centuries , was a surge in intellectual development spreading from Florence right across Europe through the universities . #% I am delighted that the Commission is accepting those so we can move ahead as quickly as possible . #% Firstly , generally , I support the common position - it is a useful compromise - but I would not support going any further than that . #% Prohibition creates huge profits for criminals , who seek to extend their market . #% 
No one pretends that there were not mistakes of policy and failures in implementation , but the lessons-to-be-learned inquiry clearly shows that decisions made were justified by the available evidence at the time . #% It is therefore extremely important that we should maintain our pressure for change at this particular juncture and I hope that once again we will give unanimous support for this motion . #% Many of these accidents - many of which can be avoided - come about because of the poor use of scaffolding or ladders . #% I have often said , though , that the common fisheries policy is a bit like an oil tanker : it takes a considerable time to turn round , and I do believe that the control regulation will go a long way to achieving the necessary level playing field where enforcement and sanctions are concerned , just as the development of regional advisory councils shall do much to bring improvements in other respects . #% That is sensible . #% My group strongly supports the initiatives taken by Commissioner Lamy and the European Commission . #% I did not support the inclusion of paragraph 9 in the resolution , however . #% This is just the first of many reports and many investigations that my committee will continue to make , because this is a long-term project . #% I should also like to state quite clearly that my committee , the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , supports this proposal and hopes that it will go forward smoothly . #% Such matters have to be resolved so that we can provide the same level of service to all our citizens and therefore guarantee the social cohesion which is so important to Europe . #% The door is open , and we want Bosnia to come through . #% The European Commission ' s recipe for dealing with this is for inspectors from the various Member States to meet together from time to time to try to improve their techniques and to make that into a recommendation . #% While we want to pursue our paragraph in the guidelines , there is the question of the annuality of the budget procedure . #% If that is included within the findings of the IGC and in the subsequent Treaty , can the Commissioner give me some idea of what sort of proposals the Commission might think it appropriate to come forward with to help islands and , in particular , the Isle of Wight , which I represent in this Parliament ? #% I happened to be chairing another meeting in another part of the building . #% This report strikes us as an excellent piece of forward-thinking , a blueprint for the WTO of tomorrow . #% in writing . - Why are we even talking about the Lisbon Treaty when it has yet to come into effect ? #% However , we have to start from where we are . #% We have gained a principle and we can make a prediction in this debate today that our view at first reading of what constituted broadcasting and the need to regulate it , will come to be accepted , even by those who most despised and criticized us in the course of the parliamentary debate . #% It clearly feels we can have these two important debates taking place without even a junior clerk from the Council coming to take a minute that he could at least pretend that he has sent to his political masters . #% We welcome this report , which is really going to encourage market-opening to the benefit of consumers and the European economy . #% Mr President , I want to raise one matter relating to the enforcement of seafarer ' s hours , of their working time onboard ships using Community ports . #% If a worker gets skin cancer , was it in the workplace , was it on the beach , was it in the back garden ? #% The main reason is that men and women tend to be employed in different occupations and men 's jobs tend to be higher paid . #% I congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski on their excellent reports which , if adopted , will make a major contribution to railway development . #% That is totally ridiculous because , if Parliament adopts amendments to the budget , it is elementary that there should be a mechanism to follow up on those amendments to know exactly what has happened . #% That is an offence to any parliamentarian ; it is totally inaccurate ; it is as inaccurate as Mr Moorhouse 's draft resolution . #% At all costs , we have to avoid a retreat into old-style sovereignty , territorial claims and intergovernmentalism . #% That is why I ask the Commission to make sure that Hague Convention is properly implemented throughout the European Union nations . #% extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended #% In practice , that clause was never used but it enabled face to be saved at the time , it enabled the transition to the new system and perhaps something along those lines is the only way forward on this very difficult point of the double majority . #% I hope that the Commission will look at both the technology and the legislation that is needed to ensure that the necessary levels of encryption can be put in place to protect the public , without aiding the criminals . #% We share the honour of being representatives for the East Midlands - information I give to this House more in shame than in anger . #% For this reason , Conservatives have abstained , as we feel , from an international perspective , that more diplomatic pressure should be brought to bear against those countries in which the practice of female genital mutilation is still allowed , and that world-wide education and diplomatic initiatives would be the best means to employ in order to put an end to the procedure . #% I am conscious of the fact that it costs , I think , around EUR 200 million a year extra to have this travelling circus and I am indignant that the European Parliament is unable to decide its own place of work . #% What about the Greeks ? #% Yes , Turkey presents challenges for the European Union . #% The report says that , in the case of printing contracts , the investigation revealed systematic and flagrant incompetence within the Committee of the Regions . #% Moreover , the Ethics Committee would have the possibility of raising its concerns and the investigator would have to act on those concerns . #% I have been asked , particularly by my colleague Lord Inglewood , who represents the area of Cumbria where test-firing of these weapons has taken place , to insist that the question as to the possible effect upon the civilian population should be taken into account when this testing is carried out . #% There was a rather interesting project a while back for a prototype hybrid bus running on a battery in the city centre and normal diesel fuel in the outlying districts . #% The week before last , in Parliament , we were launching the epilepsy White Paper . #% I support an arms embargo but not sanctions , and I am even more convinced on my return that , while it may satisfy our desire to be seen to be doing something , this is a potential dead end . #% This has meant a lot of rhetoric about a citizen 's Europe but not much change in the mentality or administrations of the Member States , as Mrs Wallis has pointed out . #% Much of that will require treaty amendments . #% This is an issue where the cooperation of the three institutions here in Brussels and Strasbourg will actually , at the end of the day , contribute to the cooperation of all three institutions and the proper representation of the European Union in Bosnia where it matters . #% Mr President , if there is anything this Parliament can do , with its long history of opposition to the death penalty , I implore you to do so by writing to the President of Pakistan appealing for clemency . #% I am sorry , Mr Sakellariou , I do not think it helpful to bring these matters up at this stage . #% Mr President , I just want to raise two points this evening at the same time as praising the rapporteur for the very sensible and courteous manner in which he has run the budget in advance of next year . #% Well I certainly had a better one before I gave up the day job a year ago , and every single Member of this House has a much better office in Brussels . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this motion for a resolution on supporting scientific cooperation with Africa is very timely , because it comes hot on the heels of a series of statements on science in Africa over the last 12 months - by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa in January 2007 , in the G8 Summit Declaration about strengthening research and development cooperation and in the new chapter on ICT and science and technology in the EU-Africa Strategy . #% In Brussels underspends are seen as a lack of need rather than a lack of efficient administration . #% I have argued very strongly that such a force should have a clear mandate to disarm the former Rwandan Army , the Interahamwe . #% Two of the major difficulties encountered by young farmers are the raising of start-up capital and subsequently the danger of overstretching their financial abilities by providing regular interest payments . #% But we have to bear in mind that , although this resolution was only advisory , the Commission had specifically said that it would take careful account of what we said in it . #% We in this Parliament must endeavour to do all we can to make it easier for European citizens to move freely around the Union . #% One further vote of thanks is also due , and that is actually to a ghost of this Chamber : that is , to my former colleague and good friend Lyndon Harrison , who was rapporteur at first reading , now Lord Harrison of Chester . #% Can I stress especially the need for President Barroso to revise the Code of conduct of Commissioners , especially the financial declarations . #% It is absolutely crucial to recognise the importance of this concentration of effort on these diseases , which , as others have said very graphically this evening , claim so many lives and cause so much suffering . #% I would like to ask the simple question : are we really certain that we will need those trees in the future for the production of wood ? #% So how far are they actually willing to pay the cost ? #% The arguments are totally unconvincing , in so far as we have actually heard any . #% Could this sole trader , who in today 's economic climate is struggling , afford to pay this indirect tax , and indeed would he and his wife want this extra burden ? #% Let us remember that the pressure for this report came as a result of some quite fanciful journalism in different countries and some wild , weird and wonderful assertions , most of which served to undermine the very case that the authors themselves were trying to make . #% Secondly , are you aware that today , 14 December 1999 , the European Youth Orchestra , the European Youth Parliament , the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation , to name just three , are yet to receive the subsidies that we voted for them for this year ? #% I hope that our report will send out a strong signal about what MEPs want to see happen on energy efficiency . #% 
in writing . - Although this is a sensitive period of time just after the enormous problems with nuclear safety in Japan , nuclear energy remains a major contributor to energy supply cross the EU and globally . #% Mr Harbour is quite right that much of this does not depend on money , or at least not on huge sums of money , and Mr Belder has been absolutely correct to enter into wide consultation with disabled people themselves . #% Commissioner Patten , when he reported back to the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday , said that the visit had gone ahead with modest aims , but those modest aims have been achieved and we welcome that . #% He says he wants no interference in industry , and yet Mrs Diamantopoulou talks about preventive measures . #% Mr President , the Liberal Group welcomes Mr Lamassoure 's report , which we find balanced and thoroughly informed . #% But I wonder if I can push the Commissioner slightly on one point : during the four or perhaps five years between one election observation mission and the next , does the EU actually offer specific help and suggestions to address any deficiencies or areas where we think that there may be a need to improve and that we can offer ideas , support and perhaps finance to make sure that countries do not repeat in one election the errors they may have made before ? #% If it is possible to break a sitting for a formal sitting on the nail , why is it not possible to take the vote at the time which is announced without there being too much difficulty ? #% In these circumstances it is not unreasonable to build on the previous content of Article 15 , use the concept of `` directed at '' , acknowledge that this is a concept also found in American jurisprudence and utilised by WIPO . #% Secondly , I asked whether the Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Rights Ombudsman would have jurisdiction over EUFOR activities with a view to avoiding the kind of criticisms levelled at SFOR regarding arbitrary arrests and the ill treatment of detainees . #% First of all , if we are in a knowledge-based society , we need growth in knowledge-based and creative skills . #% In truth , these are all guesses . #% That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both . #% We are witnessing , yet again , the historic struggle between free trade and protectionism . #% While the report goes on to say that no decision has yet been taken , the companies are pressing for a change to the injury standard of the so-called 201 market safeguard rule which would make it easier for the Americans to shut down their market to imports but stay within WTO rules . #% It is a European institution we are creating . #% But on this occasion , particularly in view of the coming election , I took the view that it was better for us to get this matter behind us . #% I particularly support the Council proposal for information exchange between competent registration authorities and the fact that the role of the insurance undertaking is prescribed in the intermediaries ' registration process , particularly for the tied intermediaries category . #% I should like to point out , though , that whilst we welcome the new security on the periphery , this building has to operate in the interests of Members . #% On the substantive issue , while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the Schengen Agreement , of course , it seemed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third-country nationals into line with those of citizens . #% Mr President , it is not a question of the Commission in any sense being complacent , either politically - because it is responsible to the public - or indeed scientifically . #% If I were speaking for the British , I would make a valid case why the UK rebate is fair and justified but I am not speaking for the British and therefore I can not say these things . #% Mr President , I would like to first congratulate both rapporteurs for their excellent work but my comments will be addressed to the Duff report . #% But non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus , where Turkey continues to station troops since the 1974 invasion , and the failure to implement the Ankara Agreement on the enlarged customs union to allow Cypriot ships to dock at Turkish ports , is currently a critical issue before the European Union . #% Every Member of this House was silent , all our visitors in the gallery were silent , but that silence was wrecked by the noise of a camera clicking away persistently . #% The PES supports all the amendments to the Commission proposals which will serve to strengthen the monitoring of the use of the money in a country where fraud , corruption and organized crime are , sadly , still part of the legacy of the civil war . #% Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties , she would not have achieved so much . #% Japan and Canada are now getting cold feet without US involvement . #% This report provides many of the answers , but the issue of the approach to the Court of Justice is still controversial . #% We have a track record of ignoring whistleblowers and financial problems alike and we are now faced with this . #% We have to ask ourselves why that is the case . #% Paragraph 2 also concerns me . #% Please convey that to the Commissioner please , as she is not listening at the moment . #% It summoned him home for treatment . #% Is this still the Commission 's view ? #% It is a measure of that concern that there is unanimity in the Committee on Petitions , even though there may be disagreement about the substance on the fact that this question has not been responded to properly . #% The Commissioner made that very clear earlier , with his customary precision and clarity , for which I must thank him . #% Over the last five years I have campaigned against this appalling environmental degradation and tried to highlight the human cost to the indigenous black African communities . #% It is the Commission 's task to assess that risk . #% Following the addition of this article to the Treaty at Maastricht we did not press the Amsterdam IGC to give Parliament a full right of initiative which would enable us to submit a proposal to the Council without going through the Commission . #% It is not because we have no misgiving about this proposed legislation , or indeed about the burden that it may in time place upon people , some of whom will be vulnerable . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I have three brief points . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , Commissioner , this is an important day for European citizens . #% Some talk about two or three million respectively , though estimates differ significantly . #% The Council 's decision to include , as part of the treaties - for the first time ever - the negotiation results in the final aspects of accession must be considered as a serious limitation of Parliament 's budget rights . #% That is why I am very pleased that , at the organisational meeting in Geneva on 18 February , both the European Union and the United States spoke in favour of the joint study on secret detention being presented to the Human Rights Council this time . #% So she is good at keeping a straight face , and she vigorously crushed any attempt in the House of Lords for the British people to have a referendum . #% Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe . #% We are all guilty of talking . #% Europe 's 120 million children must be particularly protected when the four freedoms of movement - people , goods , capital and services - range across Europe , for they are the inheritors of this market which , fashioned to the needs of all our citizens , will carry Europe dynamic , prosperous and ` job-full ' into the realms of the next century . #% There are , of course , serious issues to be addressed in relation to agriculture . #% UK Conservatives are broadly happy with the original Lambert Report , which in its initial form usefully cleaned up some technical matters . #% We have a clear part to play . #% Despite the fact that huge violations of human rights have continued to occur , there are now accepted world standards of human rights , infringement of which is internationally condemned . #% I said then and I will say again that it is time to admit that this form of European government is an abject failure and that it should be abolished . #% That will turn people off the whole process . #% Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest . #% I hope you will agree with me that it is of no value whatever to consumers to penalise successful and responsible businesses with excessive bureaucratic costs when the rip-off merchants simply ignore the legislation and go scot-free . #% It is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the Chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights . #% Even today , the Commissioner lacks the authorisation to turn the work of the high-level trade groups into a concrete deal . #% It is perfectly natural that Parliament should want to sacrifice as little of the treaty as possible , but it must also be as much as is necessary to secure agreement by every country . #% How are we to decide if members of the Petitions Committee have taken a decision on improper grounds ? #% Colleagues , you heard from Mr Grech that the potential is there to create jobs , to encourage more innovation and to move towards a more sustainable economy but we need to get the support of citizens and consumers for this proposal . #% I refer in particular to Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights , which guarantees the right to manifest one 's religious observance in public . #% It is my argument - and indeed that was expressed in my report and supported by colleagues - that if the appraisal and development system works properly there are no obstacles to achieving the linear career structure - and that is the whole thrust of what you are trying to do . #% To look the other way is to throw away our own rights and our claim to call ourselves civilised . #% Today gives us an opportunity to let business run itself without the heavy hand of Brussels always at its shoulder . #% 
It portrays the problem as follows : the preventive culture of EU directives has not yet been fully understood , nor has it been applied effectively on the ground . #% However , I do not believe that , in the case of the Balkan visa waiver , political considerations have overridden these technical standards . #% If you think of the way that President Clinton did it , it is not the same thing . #% We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it . #% Yet we still do not have a better service . #% Nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned . #% On further investigation it seems that they were trying to spy on room IPE2 425 , which is the office of one of our former Members , Mr Bernard Tapie . #% The information society has potential to transfer power from government to individual , from bureaucrat to citizen and , of course , from business to consumer . #% In the meantime , we have to accept that if we are to put the fight against rabies as our first priority , then ferrets should not be included on the list at the present time . #% The beef ban has been lifted and now the unilateral action of one Member State is undermining , certainly in Britain , the whole spirit of the European Union project . #% The agency will employ staff in ways that are subject to statutory provisions for carrying out public service tasks which the technical assistance office should not and can not take on . #% On category 4 the Commission has made proposals for a new flexibility instrument for humanitarian aid . #% Quite a lot of what we recommend in this area does in fact refer to the quality that is absolutely necessary where any of these screening processes is concerned . #% Indeed , the Prime Minister of Slovakia speaking on it said ` silence reigns , we do not have information ' . #% This dispute dates back more than 50 years ; UN resolutions have not been acted upon and , as both countries are now nuclear powers , it is very important that we resolve this dispute . #% It is not the text we would have written but we will be voting for it , as he knows . #% I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue in the House today . #% The British Medical Association was saying that 15 % of junior doctors were leaving the profession citing stress , overwork and length of hours . #% Let me try and get some clarification on what you said in your speech , Madam President-in-Office . #% A very important report produced by the British business association , the CBI , last week clearly showed that both businesses and consumers are discouraged from moving into the electronic commerce market place because of concerns about security . #% I was moved to make these remarks by Sir Leon 's use of the expression ` diversion of attention ' when talking of Congress 's attitude to Helms-Burton . #% This House was hoping to ask the Commission what its conclusions are and how it intends to proceed , and we still look forward to your guidance , but it seems we have to wait a little bit longer . #% As you know , there are regular contacts between Commission departments about specific problems with the application of Community law through package meetings and so-called directives missions . #% You carry in your mobile phone more computing power than a large computer of ten years ago . #% The British Government has described many of these proposals as being either unnecessary or disproportionate to any benefit . #% We must have a continuing education campaign throughout the European Union to improve the awareness of the Ombudsman and indeed the petitions procedure amongst our citizens . #% The United Kingdom is a strong supporter of the Single European Sky concept . #% I think you will agree with me that most European people expect support if the airline goes bankrupt and they appear to be stranded . #% The measures on asylum and immigration in the last five years are incomplete and unbalanced and have incorporated some of the worst aspects of national policies . #% We have a duty as elected representatives to ensure that European citizens whom we have encouraged to make use of their free movement rights should not then be subjected to arbitrary or unjustified restrictions in the host state . #% In short , they are isolated . #% In this case , when it comes to empowering human rights ' defenders , red tape is absolutely necessary and , I would say , brilliant . #% All in all , I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues , I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report , and I am sure that we are all looking forward - or most of us anyway - to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work . #% However , even the rapporteur admits that on enlargement , Europe 's regional income disparities will increase dramatically . #% I wish you the best of luck . #% I really just wanted to make a couple of points : there are two amendments that we have put in for the vote tomorrow which very nearly got in through the committee and were only just defeated , and I hope that when they are re-submitted tomorrow in the name of the EPP-ED Group , the whole House will be able to support them . #% UN resolutions , however , must clearly hold Iraq to account and there must be a willingness to follow through with action . #% There are two crucial points in the report : they are the twin proposals to phase out the opt-out , while opening a way to the annual calculation of working time . #% I hope the lessons that we have learnt will be properly applied . #% If this happens there will be an inevitable decline in leisure boating . #% We need strict and legally-binding purpose - and access-limitation provisions . #% I also believe -- and no-one else has mentioned this , but it is in the resolution -- that tele-medicine is a very important way of dealing with this issue . #% I understand that Madame Garaud can not for the time being undertake that mission for personal reasons , which are fully understandable and have my deepest sympathy . #% There is a symbolic and institutional importance in what Mr Ford is doing . #% Therefore I am not in favour of postponing this vote any further . #% I understand that the first point of order ever raised in the directly-elected Parliament in 1979 was by the Reverend Doctor Ian Paisley and his point was that the British flag was flying upside-down . #% I would remind Mr Tannock and others , when they are looking for parallels or examples around the world , that in different circumstances the UK Government never got anywhere with the Irish situation until we were prepared to enter into very difficult negotiations with our political opponents , people with whom we disagreed fundamentally . #% Nevertheless , it is worth saying that we have considerable respect for the work of the charities which approached us and for the work they do throughout the world to alleviate poverty and encourage economic development . #% What happened as a result of that ? #% It was strongly felt in committee that the appointment of the executive director must be made following an open competition and on criteria of competence and experience . #% I mention this in particular because the Green Group managed to call for more roll call votes than anybody else . #% Could the President-in-Office confirm that a Member State which has colonial links with that Great Lakes region of Africa is still unwilling to agree to either an international or a European arms sale embargo on Burundi ? #% It has taken much longer than people expected to bring this into operation , and that of itself raises concerns about the complexity of the instrument itself . #% We have developed a strategic planning and programming system . #% Many of us are instinctively still not convinced that any form of suspension is the right way to respond to present circumstances but nevertheless that seems to be the drift of debate . #% Slovakia has made huge political progress which we must recognise . #% We do support the creation of a budget entry sufficient to support LIFE funding for nature protection and biodiversity which we do not feel will be adequately protected or financed under the Commission 's present plans . #% We have no quarrel with the people of Europe : our quarrel is only with the system of unitary government called the European Union . #% I suggest that we can not guarantee the security of women returned to Afghanistan . #% You take a taxi , it turns into a nightmare . #% I should like to ask you to send to the Speaker of the new Duma , which is being convened next week , this House 's expression of condolences and outrage against such terrorist actions . #% That demonstrates how we have all worked together and particularly that Mrs Hermange has listened to the points that have been put to her and incorporated them into this report . #% I have asked them how long they will commit themselves to these lower prices . #% We could have the safeguards on redundancy payments and we could have the safeguards on pension contributions from Parliament rather than Members being responsible for it . #% Last year , for instance , the budgetary authority voted EUR 3 million for Euronews . #% I hope that we will go further . #% 
Finally , we should support Amendment No 27 , but not Amendment No 26 . #% Mr President , the Commission has argued that the right of access to documents and the right to privacy are both legitimate rights and that when they both enter into consideration , a balance has to be struck . #% Mr President , Europe will never be brought closer to the people , and national parliaments can never hope to hold Ministers to account so long as Europe 's most powerful law-making body continues to meet in secret . #% I agree , but if there were no Community funds , there would be no Community financial interests and , therefore , no need for their protection . #% What is an acute problem could , if matters are not dealt with properly , become a chronic one . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , we have heard a list of all the things we need , and what the House is saying is that we need action to achieve those things . #% Tribute must be given to those involved in the difficult times of the peace process and the ongoing negotiations . #% The message we should send is that human rights are non-negotiable . #% Smaller countries with particularly difficult waste disposal problems can not really be realistically expected to adhere to exactly the same levels of recycling that might be achievable in the Netherlands . #% It came to us a little late but we have made good progress . #% But it should be possible to make that case through individual assessment , not with a blanket dismissal of the claim . #% Vital services could be interrupted , transport could come to a stop and businesses could be forced to close . #% -- Mr President , I rise on a point of order . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , let me begin by congratulating Mr Schwab on his report and thanking him for his extremely cooperative approach to this whole matter . #% Or will that be an additional expenditure ? #% This move was underlined by the fact that Parliament took a very mature interest in some of that detail and effectively helped people , for example , who have to carry huge weights on ladders , to consider the very serious problems that could happen to themselves and the very serious injuries . #% Large numbers of the original population lost their lives and many of the survivors were forced to flee . #% I am referring to the fact that five MDC supporters have been killed in the past week , that MDC demonstrations and rallies have been disrupted by the police , that the independent press is restricted , the Independent correspondent , Basildon Peta , was earlier today arrested under the Public Order and Security Act and the Australian journalist Sally Sara has been refused admission . #% That being said , some of them fall within the sole competence of the social partners , while others are regulating issues and would be the exclusive competence of public authorities . #% The Korean consumer market , in turn , wants access to speciality European agricultural products , such as wines , spirits , meats , cheeses , all protected by geographical indicators . #% I am a bit puzzled by that because , if the original language has been changed , at what stage in the procedure was it changed ? #% Commissioner , I look forward to working closely with you in the new agreement that is coming up . #% The UKIP will not contribute to this imposture . #% My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions , the commitment to an adequate level , the issue of being able to provide a decent life . #% In this context , Parliament 's facilities should not be used for exhibitions designed to whip up hatred and I hope that this sentiment will be conveyed by the President to the Quaestors . #% If Commissioner Patten or his office take this view , then why have they so strongly resisted the initiative by myself and Members from other political groups to raise signatures in this House to request that Parliament set up a committee of inquiry into these very grave allegations ? #% Alas , to this day the champagne remains unclaimed , and so as an unclaimed prize , I believe I should give it to the man himself . #% It is also a member of the ACP and the Commonwealth . #% This UN convention should act to mobilise change across all levels of government : local , national and international , forcing decision-makers to recognise disability rights in a human rights context in a way that has not happened before . #% The Turkish Government should be made far more accountable to the needs of the citizen , and the forces of reform such as Mr Selçuk , President of the Court of Appeal , and his colleagues must be everywhere stimulated and supported . #% The first question one wants to ask is : is The Financial Times accurate this morning in forecasting that the Commissioner is about to answer our questions by saying that only part of the noise regulation will come into force , the part relating to the European Union , on 4 May . #% It appears that it relates to a Parliament advertisement in the Finnish Official Journal seeking , in the Finnish language , to recruit for our Legal Service an A3 , and I quote in as far as I understand Finnish , ' to be in charge of a group of idiots ' . #% Surely the preaccession process must also benefit the many millions of poverty stricken citizens . #% Those are very important skills that we need to develop and research has a very important part to play in that . #% I do not entirely dismiss all EU actions in relation to terrorism . #% Real reform for Britain will only be accomplished when we withdraw from the common agricultural policy , and indeed from the European Union itself . #% This report applies within Parliament a text that was agreed by the last Parliament , was approved in principle in plenary when we authorised our President to sign it , signed by all the institutions and now applies within each of them except , until today , within Parliament . #% Finally , taking up a point made in the explanatory statement , I see no harm in R & D being about economic growth since that is how we improve the condition of life for our citizens . #% If I had to be asked what Parliament needs , I do not think it is more formal powers , I think it is to come closer to the minds , hearts and spirits of the electorate . #% Enlargement is a dynamic process which itself will drive forward the process of reform within the EU . #% This has been talked about for years . #% I understand the point you are making in terms of preparatory action , but I wondered whether you could comment on whether actual budgetary provision will be covered under the action taken in the 2005 budgets . #% Because my region is seriously disadvantaged in educational terms and because our infrastructure is not yet up to the task , there is a huge way to go for us in order to be able to benefit from it enormously . #% As Mrs Roure said , we should encourage people to integrate and I support their efforts to learn languages . #% I do not believe that developing a Common Security Policy , which seeks to link us closely to NATO , has any part in the sustainable development of the EU . #% Mr President , it is the right of any Member of this House to raise a point of order properly under the Rules , not just some Members of this House . #% We had great problems , in the last legislature in 1999 , with negotiating a financial perspective which then tied not only the current Parliament and Commission , but also subsequent ones , to a situation where they could not revise it . #% I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school . #% Opinion polls show that the British people , if given the chance , would reject this Constitution . #% For its part , the LTTE should immediately impose a ceasefire , give up its child soldiers , stop its suicide bombings , and agree to return to the conference table in a positive and constructive spirit . #% When we referred this matter to Dr Michael Repacholi who carried out one of the original studies in Australia on the possible inducing of cancer in rats , he said that he believed that the standards now set down on the WHO guidelines were sufficient . #% We would like to see that document as soon as possible . #% Mr President , I disagree with Mr Markov . #% Therefore , our question asks what the Commission will do in order to react appropriately to developments and changes in the geopolitical , strategic and diplomatic situation . #% If there are problems with enlargement because of what has occurred , then the Commission needs to convince the Council , not us , of its needs regarding staffing levels , because some of us are actually convinced . #% According to Eurobarometer again , we are bottom of the list in terms of knowledge , but not surprisingly top of the list in having reservations and objections to the EU . #% It also introduces new provisions to ensure cooperation between veterinary and public health authorities . #% Our debate on the EU 's institutional future must draw on all of society , harnessing not just the resources of a closed Brussels policy world but the democratic potential of the Internet and - yes - of opinion polls . #% I want to pay tribute to him for his persistence in working through this , and particularly for the masterly way in which he handled the conciliation process . #% I welcome the determination to resolve the Cyprus issue and would point out that , because we have always said that we would not allow third parties to veto our future , this is forcing us finally to reach a settlement in this long-running debate . #% We have had fine words , a lot of wind and bluster from the Commissioner in charge of reforms , Mr Kinnock , but it seems that although the Commissioner can talk the talk he has failed to walk the walk . #% On the one hand they said there was no such thing as a European social model -- we have 25 different national social models -- while on the other they said that if there was such a thing as a European social model then it was a continental phenomenon and a millstone around the necks of a number of Member State economies . #% I know that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , which came into being in September 2003 , brought out a manual which is being published this year . #% We hope that we will ensure that , as far as the African Union in its future work is concerned , there will be far more consultation at grassroots level with civil society . #% The third directive brings in limited but useful changes from the second directive . #% How can we have a proper debate when we are limited to one or two minutes and then the microphone is turned off , while the Commissioner can stand up and make this disgraceful response ? #% 
In these circumstances , how can we trust the American criminal justice and law enforcement system ? #% I can not stand here tonight and say my own country is a shining example of progress as regards the recycling of packaging . #% Perhaps more importantly , how is it that the framework agreement between the Commission and the Parliament does not now allow us as parliamentarians to talk to people about technical matters and how far , therefore , does the Commission reach into our institution ? #% In passing this competence to the Community , Parliament is in some measure possibly detracting from its own hard-won legislative powers . #% To my understanding this meant that we will see what the donors can give before we decide what the needs are . #% It is time to break the deadlock . #% We all need to help him get the political dialogue for a solution going . #% It is right that we should have a range of ideas , with working groups set up by the Commission dealing with peace and prosperity and with questions of sustainable development . #% I discussed with one of the rapporteurs , Mr Menrad , the idea of putting into his report an amendment that this legislation should be looked at again within a reasonable period of time to see what improvements might be needed in the light of experience . #% No wonder we find 50 % of the information funds still in reserve , still waiting for the Commission 's proposals . #% Clearly that is what happened . #% Madam President , as previous speakers have said , it has proved to be an extraordinarily controversial process to get this far , especially for the British who have only now agreed to bring in a fair voting system , without which , it must be said , I would unlikely to be speaking here this afternoon . #% What I would be very willing to do , if you have not seen it , is to pass it on to you . #% It should combine the macro-economic policy agenda with structural policies in the economic , social and environmental fields to aim at the creation of at least five million net new jobs by 2015 , particularly in the green economy . #% They are best placed to pick up some of the worst scams which now prevail and inform the public that what may , at first sight , appear to be a bargain , is really a snare and delusion . #% Indeed , I also regret his receiving hate mail , as he described . #% Last September the Commission asked Parliament to give urgency to consideration of its proposals . #% I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002 , but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect . #% It should not be left to the employer to enforce it . #% Are the weapons we are using spreading uranium oxide in that area ? #% Mr President , I would also like to support the rapporteur , in particular his recommendation to the House that we endorse the common position on the establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency , albeit with the important provisos so clearly stated . #% We must therefore ensure that , in areas where air transport is an essential means of transport , it is not destroyed or damaged by excessive competition . #% All will help to create what I regard as a safer environment on our roads . #% I recognise that in the current atmosphere it is difficult to justify EU technical assistance but we must continue that process because of the importance Russia has for us for security reasons as well as economic reasons . #% The other condition is that the fund must not create an open-ended drain on Community funds . #% Take our Amendment 44 on classified documents . #% But seriously , we must consider first of all the whole way in which this work is to be carried out . #% I urge Members to approach these reports pragmatically . #% Are national barriers preventing progress in this area as well , or is there an unwillingness on the part of the rail industry to embrace the concept of interoperability ? #% Madam President , prior to the unification of Yemen in May 1990 , human rights and democratic freedom were accorded little respect in either North or South Yemen . #% Even so , the European Environmental Bureau has criticised us , asking : `` Why do we need a directive at all if the 2010 targets are not fully binding ? '' #% It is certainly true that in some of those Member States - notably Germany and the Netherlands - considerable concern has been expressed about the degree of nitrofuran residues in poultry and the extent to which even a very sophisticated Member State can not guarantee by itself the degree of testing . #% We are delighted that the Commission is finally banishing the spectre of social dumping and all the other caricatures of this directive that have been put about by its opponents without the Commission making any case for its positive side . #% I am therefore very concerned that these two different inquiries , which may proceed as a result of any votes taken here today , will cause confusion , difficulty and may indeed prejudice the position of the European Parliament . #% On the other hand , he presents to us a Pact for Stability which has the word ` growth ' attached to it , although there is nothing in the Pact related to growth , only to stability , which potentially undermines any measures we can take to boost research and development , systems of education or growth . #% This is largely because Russia bankrolls the illegal regime in Tiraspol and continues to garrison troops in Transnistria . #% We must not be so arrogant as to imply that Europe has nothing to learn from others . #% Is such lack of transparency necessary , useful or , taken to its extreme , even in line with the principles of justice that one associates with an advanced democratic community ? #% Similarly it is important that the documents sent with the persons concerned are properly dealt with during the transit process . #% It also provides a country-focused perspective , with an account of EU action in its immediate neighbourhood , in Africa , in the Americas , in Asia and in the Middle East . #% In France it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty . #% The basis of the regulation is to provide those people from one Member State living or working in another with the same right to social security provision as a national living in that Member State . #% There would be a desire to integrate and at that stage it would seem Sarbanes-Oxley would surely come into play , which was why she was so careful with her words . #% We have got the problem at Renault , you have seen the problems at Enfield in London and at Halewood in Liverpool in the Ford company . #% The presidency is quite right in standing firm on this issue and the issue of the Foreign Minister and defending the proposals from the Convention . #% At present some countries have no penalty whatsoever , some impose a very small fine and in some countries the fines are perhaps too penal . #% Some of us had hoped that we were at the very least talking about a process that would finally lead to a proper report setting out the detail of a proposed statute that would be clear , transparent and that every Member would have the right to amend and vote on and stand accountable to his or her voters and finally , once and for all , to draw a line under the criticism that we are so easily subject to . #% Could you tell us whether all the other inhabitants of the second floor are to be subjected to this on a permanent basis , or would you recommend that we move to Brussels until we have a chance to have offices that again return us a view of the French countryside ? #% We have voted against a number of amendments that would undermine the market and enterprise driven policies that we believe a revised Lisbon agenda should champion . ' #% In Luxembourg we confirmed Turkey ' s eligibility for accession to the EU . #% We now look to both sides to make full use of this opportunity for constructive political dialogue , particularly to the authorities in Belgrade , given their primary responsibility as a government to seek a negotiated solution . ' #% Fortunately , there are many worthy , hardworking organisations doing a great deal to promote European Union and cooperation . #% We have recognised that , if EPAs are to be successfully concluded , there must be more ACP engagement than has been demonstrated throughout these negotiations . #% I welcome President Musharraf 's announcement that he is clamping down on terrorism , but it is also important to look at the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir , which has been going on for over 50 years . #% The third major horizontal issue in the report highlights a lack of balance between legislative and non-legislative instruments . #% Then we joined the common market and the CFP , and now these seas are a marine desert in the making , if not already so . #% It has been a real labour of Hercules but , despite that , I fear she has not , in the view of the British Conservatives , been able satisfactorily to resolve the issues that have been so vigorously debated in the Legal Affairs Committee . #% Mr President , in order to accommodate the strongly expressed wishes of part of the PPE-DE Group , my group withdraws its request for a separate vote on Amendment 3 , which should enable you then to take all the amendments en bloc . #% As far as the European Parliament was concerned , the STOA unit , Parliament 's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment group -- which had led the initiative to be represented there -- had its own stand , in conjunction with the Commission . #% These are issues which , of course , are now left to the Member State . #% It is not often that I can agree with the opposite side of the House but on this particular occasion I happen to agree with Mr Hallam 's position . #% Once again , I would remind you that there are 27 Member States : 11 of them are net contributors and 16 of them are recipients , and there is a San Andreas fault between those who contribute and those who do not . #% The creative industries in Europe contribute some 12 % to Europe 's GDP . #% If we do that , I am sure that we can move forward to approve the whole package in what will be a major advance for the European economy and for Europe 's competitiveness . #% I commend the priorities the Union has set itself , as the Commissioner has outlined today , because , as I said , it is not a simple matter . #% The report praises the common agricultural policy , which was one of the worst EU mistakes ever . #% 
The Commission can confirm that the nomination and appointment of the new Director-General for Press and Communication fully conformed with the requirements of the Staff Regulations and with the Commission 's internal procedures for the meritocratic selection and appointment of senior officials . #% Mr Liikanen has used the word ` serenity ' but , as an Americanist , I would always say that ` eternal vigilance ' is the key . #% In the light of the circumstances we have seen today , it is no wonder that people in the United Kingdom , Denmark and Sweden are all saying a big ` no ' to the euro . #% The time is going to come when we will impose a ban on this , when carcasses only will be permitted . #% These are very much in the hands of the Bulgarian authorities , although we can help . #% There are two things in the last ten years that have put immense pressure on defence-related industries . #% Mr President , in view of the vote on the Papayannakis report I should like to ask the Commission to convene a conciliation committee next week so that we sort this out before the 1 September deadline . #% We entirely agree with the report 's emphasis on the role that regional advisory councils can play in the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing methods and with the necessity of affording them increased technical and financial support . #% I believe there are a number of solutions which can start to be applied here . #% Similarly the rights of creditors in Member States other than their own are safeguarded by the assurances of cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States , but let us be clear , in case some of you have not read the document , this is not about harmonisation , it is about mutual recognition of Member States ' reorganisation measures and winding up procedures . #% But by late 2006 , the US mandate will have run out and , with it , the chance to eradicate poverty . #% It is widely accepted that the adoption of accrual-based accounting systems has been a success and that that installation has been responsible for much marked improvement . #% Why should it have to do anything else ? #% When you look at the disgraceful treatment of legitimate tourists in Greece on a plane-spotting holiday , we now know just what pan-European Union justice can mean ! #% It was submitted on 19 September , which should have made it sixth on our paper . #% Is that what I am going to tell Wigan Athletic supporters ? #% The financial arrangements are going to be difficult to agree and I do not underestimate them , but we must keep a sense of perspective . #% In particular , I would urge greater attention to be paid to the administrative and judicial capacity of these applicant countries . #% I think for all of us the future for our children and grandchildren is a future of great opportunity , though also of great uncertainty . #% Coming from a country which is out , and a party which opposes joining , I was half expecting more glitches and popular resentment at the imposition of an unfamiliar currency . #% I also want to start by congratulating the Commission - yes , I do mean it ! #% I suppose that there is great irony in all this in that , as a very committed eurosceptic , I have been asked to lead this charge today . #% On Article 1 , the Commission will pay particular attention to providing an adequately staffed and appropriately identified structure so as to ensure the implementation of the decision , taking into account the availability of resources . #% Women who have suffered violence - and a majority suffer in silence - and their children need to have the confidence to report attacks , secure in the knowledge that they will be provided with effective support . #% I fully endorse many of the points he made , not least in respect of blood-alcohol limits . #% The Commission blames the Member States for not providing information about the lack of action in time for the proper democratic procedures to ensue . #% I am appalled that , for example , less than 5 % of available EU funding had been taken up in my own region at the beginning of the year . #% A short analysis is provided at the end of each main chapter . #% Thus the clear message today has to be that the Commission must reform a system which unintentionally sustains cruelty . #% It is evidence of the fact that young people are extremely interested in politics . #% What could be more calculated to create unemployment than guaranteeing a minimum income for not working ? #% All too often that is what has happened in the past . #% As for the results , without referring to individuals , many in my Group have already indicated which performers have been good or less good in the incoming Commission . #% It is important for the record to clarify the situation in the UK relating to the UK Government 's view on blood alcohol . #% I commend Romania 's progress to this House . #% We would then be able to discuss , debate , consult on and conclude a programme which the Union could put forward for the year ahead . #% I totally endorse what she says about what is termed ` duality ' . #% For the first time in many years a solution seems to be in sight . #% The love of one human being for another is never lessened by gender or sexuality : it is love . #% It says that the current legal basis of the Treaties does not allow it to go any further . #% Every question I now want to ask the Commission comes from that experience . #% Are the Christian Democrats boycotting this debate ? #% Parliament , Council , Commission , Court of Justice , Court of Auditors - the whole panoply of European Union institutions - have a statute that does not permit us to exercise the degree of autonomy which is the basis for many of the arguments correctly put forward this morning . #% I am glad that you say that NGOs have been consulted . #% . -- Mr President , if you sat down and deliberately tried to plan the family Christmas from hell , you could not do a better job than the British Presidency has managed to achieve in the last six months . #% However , by itself , none of this is enough to revive an economy which remains very fragile with rising unemployment and levels of poverty . #% We were going to become the world 's most dynamic and vibrant economy , with full employment . #% It is trophy hunting : people who go out and shoot big game and come home proudly but sickeningly with a trophy of the head of a rare animal . #% Unable to compete with the modern vessels of the EU , these people sought work elsewhere , and the Canary Islands began to experience the trauma of massive illegal immigration . #% Will he bring forward to this Parliament plans to do more work in that area ? #% Mr President , circulating the streets of Strasbourg this morning was a mobile advertising hoarding asking this Parliament how it could ignore the wishes of 450 million voters . #% It is our duty to protect the interests of passengers by encouraging more small airlines to set up and expand and by not allowing large airlines to completely dominate the market by wiping out all competition . #% We exceeded the ceilings in three categories - in category 1b we will have to see how Parliament votes on Thursday . #% Unfortunately we do not have it yet , but I would like to think that if the Member States comply with what we seek from them and we get the information , we will have the implementing report early next year , at which time we will be able to give you a complete answer to the basic point you have raised . #% In these circumstances no treaty in these circumstances is better than a bad treaty . #% The parliamentary groups in this Parliament , thanks to the efforts of the Intergroup on Ageing in Parliament , no longer exercise age limits . #% The Commission needs to avoid making proposals which will be a burden on industry and we in this Parliament must show responsibility and exercise self-restraint . #% It is surprising that last year the Petitions Committee was at some risk and the report by Mrs Lambert shows the very good work that has been down by the Petitions Committee . #% We must secure these goals and we do so in a spirit of openness and mutual respect . #% I would ask that he be removed and identified and that consideration be given to withdrawing or at least doing something with the pass . #% Linford Christie has campaigned throughout his career against doping in sport . #% To quote Mr Fourçans : ' The success of the euro must be economic as well as monetary . #% There is far too much emphasis on their rights rather than on their duties and responsibilities . #% The problem is that we all go back to our own doctors in our various home towns and therefore any links between our symptoms and this House are perhaps lost . #% Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word ` gouvernance ' , first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French , is less clearly understood than in English and French . #% The relationship is vitally important for both sides but , please , a little less arrogance by ` us Europeans ' towards ` those Americans ' . #% 
This amendment is totally acceptable to all airlines and cabin crew and it in no way stops passengers having cabin baggage . #% We should also bear in mind that many high-energy biofuels may be better used in heat and power production rather than transport - another reason for allowing Member States to develop their own biofuel strategy . #% I am absolutely convinced , and I am sure you will confirm it , that the formulation fully respects -- and I use the word from the directive -- the rules under which service providers operate in their own Member State . #% Clearly , Parliament has its own representatives present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos . #% What we want on Friday is a clear statement from Mr Byrne as to the legality of the document produced by the French Government . #% The changes are , of course , beneficial in themselves , not just as a prerequisite for EU membership . #% Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will , for instance , be amongst those that receive particular attention . #% People are watching , NGOs are watching , businesses are watching environmental concerns , health , animal welfare . #% However , during this vote several amendments have been adopted which have not been assessed . #% With our shared history and commitment to secular government and religious pluralism , the EU and India are natural partners . #% It will be judged by the quality , rather than quantity , of its legislation , by its ability to implement its policies and by its determination to bring about real reform that will benefit the population at large in a tangible manner . #% How can this major issue , which is a key issue for Cancun , and its implications for developing countries have been so marginalised here in the debate ? #% Over 60 % of them are aged over 55 . #% Such a national cuckoo inside the federal nest would shatter the codecision procedure , which is the key formula in the Union 's own march towards becoming a mature post-national parliamentary democracy . #% Thirdly , we invite Northern Dimension member countries to be aware of the importance of two EU programmes in our committee 's area of responsibility : Galileo and SESAR , because we believe that the commitment of northern dimension parties to both of these would reinforce sustainable growth and competitiveness in the region . #% Decisions that affect the security of the United Kingdom , its territory and citizens , are the responsibility of Her Majesty 's Government and not the European Union . #% in writing . - I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments . #% What on earth is he doing seeking another job when it is quite obvious that the job he already has is beyond him ? #% First , that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely unclear : the parameters have been so tampered with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely dubious . #% This is an own-initiative report by the Industry Committee and therefore it is a privilege to work on what are a relatively select number of these reports and to be the custodian on behalf of my committee . #% Due to a lack of good governance , we are concerned that these funds may not be used for the purposes for which they were intended , and thus the Conservative Delegation abstained on the final vote . #% In the UK , the Health and Safety Executive , the body looking at accidents in the workplace has estimated that some 30 % of all prohibition notices in the United Kingdom are issued for unsafe scaffolding alone . #% Italy bars them from being ambulance drivers , but the UK , Portugal and Greece do not . #% I would ask the Commission to think carefully about some of the exceptions we have looked at here : small quantities of paints prepared in traditional ways , often for traditional uses , whether it be for old cars or for buildings . #% It would encourage extremist forces and shake business confidence , and nothing would be achieved that can not be achieved by other means . #% I congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski and the Civic Platform , as well as the Law and Justice Party , on their victory in yesterday 's general election , and I am sure Poland has a great future under new leadership . #% Discussions with the Council have shown clearly the shortfalls existing in some Member States for their own citizens at present , especially in relation to legal aid - crucial if people are to have access to the law and some defence against those who have the power - and also where effective systems are not in place to adequately represent lone children and young people in their own right . #% Similarly , it is vital that regional TV should be involved . #% Given that small to medium-sized businesses are the strongest element of growth in the economy , this proposal helps to strengthen the conditions for such growth . #% Therefore it is only logical to change the word to ` any ' so that it would read : ` Calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter concerning the financing of the fisheries agreements which should take into consideration the possible budgetary consequences of any increase in the number of agreements in the near future ' . #% I turn to Mr Bourlanges ' report and thank him for the work that he has done . #% We have fishermen with no fish to catch . #% It is a very bad proposal and I hope that Mr Liikanen when he speaks will agree to suspend it . #% We also have to consider the kind of Europe we wish to build . #% The problem has not been the legal immigration into our countries , but the illegal immigration to other countries that has propelled the growth of the black economy . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating not only the rapporteur on the report but also the Commission on the communication . #% Would the Council agree that the European Union must give sustainable long-term support to the continental peace efforts that have been made and give assistance to the architecture which has been put in place to build security on the continent by the African Union ? #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , of course , much has changed in this last year . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Hedkvist Petersen for putting together what is a balanced compromise that reflects interests across Parliament . #% In any case if you feel that it had shortcomings , the best way to improve it is to use the process of 2004 . #% I know this Commissioner 's enthusiasm for the subject . #% I was responsible for the amendment raising the serious issue of organised crime in the Balkans . #% In terms of substance , it is clear that the GSP urgently needs to be simplified since it is clearly not working properly . #% The US has taken a lead in this war . #% What I will do is to press my point of order . #% There are great challenges facing the postal sector , but also great opportunities . #% It is time for further action to be taken and for the sanctions to be strengthened and reinforced . #% I refer here to short-term special security measures such as the ones we saw last year at Heathrow airport in London . #% Worse , the recently-formed Haitian National Police has been able to enforce the rule of law and has been severely criticised by human rights groups for its own abuse of protesters protesting against President Aristide 's rule and for failing to protect them from machete and gun-wielding government-supporting militias . #% They have profited from trade liberalisation and they have exploited cheap labour - and , all too often , cheap materials - but failed to adequately redistribute the wealth they have created at others ' expense . #% Lies have been disseminated as to her motivation . #% If you look at the whole question of drugs and the issues of enlargement of the European Union , Turkey is an intrinsic part of the supply routes for drugs coming into Europe . #% More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life . #% in writing . - Mr Lipietz 's report deals with an important issue . #% Nevertheless , this whole area of jurisprudence ... #% Might there be a danger that the impact assessments being done by the directorates-general themselves would perhaps be a little too favourable towards the proposals ? #% They are not protecting human health , nor are they protecting the vulnerable . #% But I would remind the Council that Parliament 's position is clear , unambiguous and has been arrived at with a clear political consensus across political divides . #% Mr President , this matter is one of the utmost importance . #% It is useless ! #% There will be , as Mr Lamy knows , a thematic session on trade , which I know he will expect to be used by the LDCs as a platform in preparation for the Qatar ministerial meeting . #% My own country , the United Kingdom , consists of one large island plus the north of Ireland . #% This assistance must evolve from reconstruction to development , just as it evolved from emergency aid to reconstruction . #% I would like to assure her - though hopefully she needs no such assurance - that such passion and such conviction is shared also on this side of the House , as I am sure it is right across the House . #% For some of the issues that have been raised , guarantees must be offered that resource levels for the ACP will be maintained and increased , and that means a five-year financial framework has to be jointly agreed with the ACP . #% We and Her Majesty 's Government agree that spending should be increased in those areas that add value . #% 
First , I am concerned about the size of the larger notes , particularly the five hundred euro note that is going to be issued , which is far larger than the largest note in common use in the United States , in the United Kingdom and in Japan . #% In some countries , when reactors have had to be shut down , there has been a loss of electricity which has caused severe hardship . #% We need radical overhaul , not just modifications . #% My second point has been touched upon by the previous speaker . #% It is happening , the ACP are preparing documents and there is clear discussion going on . #% As a European Parliament , we must do everything we can to prevent a recurrence . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Parliament 's rapporteur , Mr Färm , for his extremely cooperative and helpful approach to the budget this year . #% The point that he made very clearly is one which I believe to be very important - that this piece of legislation is one of a larger series of pieces of legislation which are going to regulate electronic commerce . #% For the euro area in particular this failure is a serious own goal . #% Are we mad to be here at this time of night debating this issue ? #% I know that the United Kingdom and some other countries have already provided assistance in the fight against organised crime . #% In spite of Mr Wijsenbeek 's question , would the Commissioner bear in mind in his discussions with Swiss Telecom that telecommunications now operate in a world global market , and could he therefore tell us the relative size of the new merged company in Switzerland vis-à-vis British Telecom and their new merged company following the # 15bn merger they have made with MCI in the United States ? #% In November last year it was left to the European Parliament to enforce the sanctions by denying the Zimbabwean representatives access to the European Parliament . #% Mr President , I should like to inform the Labour Party , having made that comment , that Mr Moorhouse has obviously found the real third way , which is liberal democracy . #% What I did not refer to when I spoke previously was Parliament ' s role in this legislative process . #% So , I think we have made progress on those issues . #% For decades , the British people have been forced to foot the bill for various projects around the EU , most of which are of no benefit at all to the UK taxpayer . #% Finally , we should refer to the Byzantine tangle of comitology . #% There is no other option : if the EU wants to become a credible global player in the new economy and the information society , substantive amounts of money should be invested in this domain as soon as possible . #% No doubt this is the first move in the next set of proceedings in the ECJ . #% However , we fundamentally disagree with the premise of this report which , in effect , states that further enlargement can only proceed successfully if the European Constitution comes into force . #% I must go back to your remark earlier , Mr President , on a point of order . #% But then I saw in a bookshop a discounted copy . #% The proposed budget of EUR 650 million is both too much and too little : too much because such a sum , wisely used , could potentially achieve some good ; too little because at about EUR 1.50 for each EU citizen , it can not make the broad-scale changes that are envisaged . #% We failed to get the British presidency to take the needs of individual citizens seriously . #% We have 12 weeks a year of plenary sittings here in Strasbourg . #% He gave every appearance of drifting from summit to summit unable or unwilling to provide the kind of leadership we British Conservatives called for in June . #% But what about international ferry journeys and international coach journeys ? #% The Ombudsman is there , as we all know , to act as the arbiter in a fair and objective way . #% We have to be a little more lenient there . #% I was not even asked before it was imposed upon me . #% As the Commission knows , Parliament has always felt that arrangements for the agreement of Basel II inadequately reflect the Parliamentary process . #% The world , methods and technology have changed much since then . #% I would like to join in the praise for the tough stand the Commissioner has taken , but I want to reinforce what she said about not wanting to over-regulate . #% The ethical , legal and social aspects of research issues are increasingly important , if not as important as actual research . #% For the single market to flourish and for Europe to flourish we need an educated and mobile workforce , confident about crossing national boundaries . #% I believe that the House should confirm that vote on Thursday , by granting discharge to the Commission for the year 1996 . #% I am not yet giving up on the fact that they might very well be persuaded to be involved in these matters . #% The details still need to be spelt out but we now have an acquis from the Amsterdam and Nice negotiations that the European Parliament participates via its President in the meetings at the level of ministers and via two representatives at the level of the working group that does the negotiating . #% Mr President , I speak from local experience of the zero-tolerance campaign run in Thurrock in my constituency . #% There are probably more antique instruments being circulated and placed on the market in Europe than there are new instruments being created . #% There are four things that we need to do . #% Divided , we weaken our power for human rights . #% I would only say that since that is nearly 20 % of the total number of appointments , we are on target for this year ' s commitment to ensure that we achieve at least a 20 % advance in the number of women who are appointed . #% I want to refer partly to a point of order and partly to yesterday 's Minutes . #% Had we not ceded that right of privacy , we would not have freedom of movement across the European Union . #% Mr President , I can not disguise my disappointment that the report has just been rejected . #% Mr President , I welcome the plans for serious revision of the GSP , which is long overdue . #% That was the point we secured in conciliation and I think we arrived at a sensible agreement . #% We will be pursuing that as rigidly as possible as well . #% ASEAN countries can not insulate themselves from the outside world , just as we in Europe and Britain can not . #% The test is implementation . #% We remain faithful to what has guided us in the last few budgets in terms of three particular elements which are important to us . #% It seems to me to be dangerous for the Rules of the House and the proceedings if Members are asked to vote on a subject of a report which bears very little relation to the title . #% I hope the presidency can take that message to any Member States which have doubts about that area . #% It is going to come from profits . #% It is urgent because we have not yet defined how to control the spread of small arms and light weapons , nor have we strengthened the code to cover conventional arms . #% We should therefore be also looking at the root causes of this displacement , whether it is persecution in their home countries , poverty or other reasons . #% When I was a practising lawyer , I often had recourse to Hague conventions to assist clients caught up in troubles with a cross-border dimension . #% Could you also ascertain whether the Members concerned had a formal invitation from relevant bodies in the USA and intend to declare their visit in the Members ' register of interests ? #% The same applies to a major epidemic of a commercially important animal disease such as foot and mouth . #% However , the present crisis has shown that such policies leave their practitioners vulnerable to events totally beyond their control . #% Anti-independence militias armed by the Indonesian military have created havoc and killed large numbers of people in a desperate bid to frustrate the demand for self rule . #% On 11 May Mr Gusinsky 's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles . #% It indicated that despite the fact that there would be more complexity , the economic analysis demonstrated that the competitive effects were comparatively small and accepted the view of the rapporteur that there were consumer benefits to offset it . #% It is no use talking about tools and barometers . #% 
Mr President , I speak from three perspectives . #% Enlargement has to deliver a safer Europe for our citizens , a Europe safe from criminals , drug runners , terrorists and people traffickers . #% We do not live in a neutral situation , we live in a situation where there is a great deal of disinformation and it is the responsibility of all concerned to see that is answered . #% I am concerned that neither of your statements , Presidents , mentioned the fact that the foundation of economic growth in the European Union has to be the completion of the internal market , in spite of the fact that this is the tenth anniversary . #% In these circumstances there would be no case whatsoever for the Helms-Burton Act . #% The observatory is used to perform those tasks that Eurostat can not . #% The result is that broiler chickens suffer from leg disorders and lameness , enlargement of the heart , sudden death syndrome and ammonia burns . #% A map of assets , that is readily available and ready to use when disaster strikes , was promised in 2009 . #% Mr President , in the United Kingdom when we think of fishing we tend to think of fish that we eat , fish and chips , maybe even fish that we might eat in the restaurants around Strasbourg . #% Here we are in this fantastic palace of energy use , debating what might be the end of civilisation . #% I do not think retrofitting digital tachographs is feasible at a cost that most people could afford . #% So I welcome the fact that we are addressing these issues at long last . #% The gaps between them provide this figure of about 70 billion lost to the Member States in a year , 35 to 40 times the amount which is actually defrauded from the EC budget . #% India has built the world 's fourth largest wind power industry , developed biogas digesters and solar cells and supported the development of renewable energy in Asia . #% I know that this measure would be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that we are at last beginning to realise that we have to work together to achieve such ends . #% The Commission is the motor of integration . #% Ten new flags appeared in our Chamber today . #% This meets a long-standing demand of the European Parliament , and the British Presidency is to be congratulated on achieving this breakthrough . #% I am sure General Morillon will be pleased when I convey to him your commitment to trying to find a resolution to the problem of timing . #% Certainly we in Britain would not like to see Brussels running our Treasury . #% Until the case is proven we should be following the Swedish model . #% Fantasy solutions are as detrimental as pollution itself . #% For example , Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development . #% As I understand it , we have a proposal which may both rescue and prolong the EHLASS project and incorporate it into the injury prevention programme . #% There is a great deal in it which ought to be strongly supported by this Parliament . #% The bombing needs to be stopped . #% No doubt during the debate you will be asked questions concerning what you think of some of those amendments . #% That is just one example of how CETA will interfere with domestic policy in Canada . #% If decommissioned vessels are to be exported , this must be under stringent conditions as to suitability , processed in accordance with the full assessment of needs , only upon request by the country concerned and accompanied by appropriate assistance . #% What Europe is missing is a common foreign and security policy that would give us that voice . #% With the events of 11 September and the high murder rate inside the United States of America , I wonder just what it will take for America to cooperate with the rest of the world on this problem . #% However , when I look at the amendments , there are some that I can not support which went through the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% Mrs Hermange has the correct approach : we are not seeking to amend the detail of the structure of the guidelines . #% That applies to businesses , organisations , service providers , manufacturers , contractors all over the European Union . #% She is nodding , so I take that to be the case . #% Haiti is also a country which also remains lawless and unstable at present . #% This includes , for example , recent welcome moves to national dialogue by Joseph Kabila in the Congo , the democratic alternation of power in Cape Verde , the tentative maintenance of the peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea and , as we saw for ourselves in the Joint Assembly last year , the entrenchment of democracy in post-Abacha Nigeria . #% Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars , I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us . #% We also need information about when the substitutes which the industry may introduce will be open to equivalent testing . #% I congratulate them for their single-mindedness and the efficiency with which they pursued it . #% I too welcome the identification in Mr Solana 's report and elsewhere of the changes that could be made . #% When it came to us originally , this proposal reflected a certain element of split personality , because it addressed physical security of supply -- keeping the lights on , and investment in infrastructure -- but also market measures aimed at the same thing . #% It is a great prize worth a lot of effort . #% That is why we need eCall , which is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system based on the 112 emergency number . #% The Commission reforms will put us in a strong position when we sit around the table at the WTO talks in Cancun . #% This does not mean that the adviser has to disclose the nature of the advice , for technical secrecy can be maintained - just that the advice has been given . #% I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to focus on just one key issue in the short time that I have , namely the dangers of the militarisation of space . #% Every year , each of the two periodical reports on suspected infringements produced before infringement proceedings are open and each of the two reports on established infringements that are produced after notice has been given to the Member State concerned cover some 2 000 or so cases investigated by the Commission . #% Can we have an assurance , Commissioner , that they will not be penalised for the inevitable technical problems that they encounter from time to time ? #% We need to see continued improvement in human rights . #% Every real supporter of football has the right to go to a football game and spectate , and then come away without a threat of violence , without problems on the streets and without being harassed unduly by people we do not particularly like to meet at any time : football hooligans . #% We must make full use of Europe 's older workers , increase gender equality across the labour market , and encourage women to become entrepreneurs . #% It seems to me that they do very little challenging of the executive in terms of questioning , financing and so on . #% It would be a gross abuse of the democratic process for the Commission to undertake a euro propaganda campaign in those countries before referenda on the currency take place . #% Finally , there is a difficulty because the price estimates that have been produced by the Commission thus far are somewhat at variance with the estimates we have from the retailers themselves . #% Those realities , together with the approach of further enlargements , all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission , so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development , of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness , maximum responsibility and maximum accountability . #% Mr President , everyone , especially lawyers like myself , is in favour of justice and civil rights . #% Secondly , I have a particular problem with the so-called Table 1a amendment , again based on the Bodensee limits , but even stricter . #% If the ability to speak your home nation 's language properly was generally used as a measure of the right of residency , I can think of a lot of people back home who would not have the right to live there ! #% If that is the case then it is good news indeed . #% I condemn the actions of the Portuguese Government and I urge this House to do likewise . #% We should give that to them and vote against this report . #% Mr President , I too would like to support the substance of the German Council initiative to improve on the exchange of information on counterfeit travel documents and to strengthen the security of the European Union 's borders both for Member States such as my own , the United Kingdom , which are outside of Schengen as well as those that are at the EU perimeter . #% We support , therefore , the ambitious but realistic target set by Mr Cornelissen - namely , a 40 % reduction by the year 2010 . #% If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers . #% That is one of the areas where there is a major loss of own resources to the European Union budget . #% 
In the United Kingdom , the National Health Service could not run without the willingness of dedicated doctors and nursing staff to work long hours . #% I hope that we in the European Parliament will send the strongest possible message that mandatory targets on energy saving are necessary . #% I would also draw attention to the important environmental measures - particularly tyre pressure monitoring systems - which will not only save on CO2 but also make cars safer , because under-inflated tyres are a cause of many accidents . #% This is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay . #% In fact , just the other day a Member of the Malian Parliament with whom I am in contact told me that it is difficult for parliamentarians there to exercise legislative power , because the executive branch simply does not provide them with information . #% It is something which affects millions of our fellow citizens in Europe , not once in a while , but every day of every year , and that is mental illness . #% We have to accept that in any conflict situation there is grave fault on both sides , and that the military responses have in many cases been disproportionate . #% I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission 's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field . #% All laudable stuff . #% Mr President , as we witness the Israeli disengagement from Gaza , completed in one-third of the time planned , with no casualties and with no wave of terror as predicted by some , I reflect on what the critics said when that disengagement was first announced . #% Imagine , that is you being tortured , mutilated , imprisoned , stoned to death because you are different or hold a different opinion . #% Mr President , I too wish to commend Mrs Lalumière on her excellent report . #% The British people need to know that the proposed common foreign and security policy will prevent Britain from ever again being able to act independently , militarily or politically , whether in alliance with the USA or not . #% With the support that she has received from Mr Rocard and from yourself , she has managed to make progress in face of the tensions between the high expectations of those whose lives will be affected by these decisions , some six million workers , and the difficulties and some intransigence presented by certain Member States . #% Is he also saying that in his view , if there is a dispute , then there should be legal recourse in the UK ? #% I hope it will not lead to a transfer of jobs but instead will increase consumers ' confidence , here in Europe and across the world , in the chemicals our industry produces . #% Would an agreement to do this override agreements between Cuba and individual European Union Member States and be enforceable in the European Court ? #% And although he said in his answer that it is the responsibility of the Member States to implement , is there anything in the White Paper that can push the Member States a bit further to make sure they do just that ? #% His assertion that the parliamentary dialogue with the ECB must not be confined to monetary policy is persuasively argued . #% We predicted a massive migration : condemned though we were at the time , we have been proved right ; there are well over half a million in Britain that are registered for work , but nobody doubts that the true figure is much nearer one million . #% We also discussed at the Vatican the values shared by all faiths , including Islam , concerning the integrity of human beings , their rights and the universal belief in the peaceful resolution of disputes , whether in the context of democracy or other systems . #% The only people to benefit from it will be compensation lawyers . #% I understand there is likely to be a major second reading and quite a lot of work to be done at Council level . #% It is an expensive exercise , duplicating Senator Marty 's efforts in the Council of Europe , and one driven by a political desire by the left and liberals to bash America , and the CIA in particular , in their efforts to fight global terrorism . #% This freeing-up of spectrum would clearly raise issues for existing users , such as the question of potential interference . #% It could encourage Member States to use the agency to implement their own programmes . #% Let me raise two specific issues . #% It is a rare occasion in history where peoples of Europe can potentially have their own say on what a so-called constitutional framework would look like post-2004 . #% However , general and business aviation contributes significantly to economic growth , especially at a regional level as we in north-east England can attest . #% In that case we should be working to the future , thinking about how we rebuild Iraq with United Nations support and how we secure peace in Iraq whilst respecting the rights of Iraqi people to their own future . #% I am sure you will sympathize with the fact that I have to catch an aeroplane to return to the United Kingdom . #% That is something the Commission is also working on , but we are right to emphasise that in our report . #% We ought to get that sorted out . #% We note that the UK Government also supports the Conservative position , and we are hopeful that on this occasion Labour MEPs might also accept the instructions of their home government . #% I heard what Mrs Niebler said earlier on in the debate and I was astonished by it . #% I would just like to say two or three things to the rapporteurs and then to Members in the Chamber . #% I am delighted that my amendments in committee were significant in changing the nature of this report . #% However , to be fair , he was acquitted of abuse and fraud but convicted for providing false information . #% In the context of these complex multilateral discussions , that is not a very long time . #% Instead it has become a bureaucratic monster which is wrecking our economy . #% I am at a loss as to why chocolate has been singled out in this respect because there are many other food products being sourced from Third World countries where the same issues pertain -- labelling issues and quality standards are very important across the whole of the sector . #% The enormity of this error conceals the fact that even very low doses of radiation , like that from depleted uranium , can in fact have devastating health impacts . #% In that respect alone , I have some sympathy with what Mr Le Gallou has just said . #% On that basis we will support urgency , but warn the Commission that , if it tries to do this again , we may have reached the limit of our tolerance . #% It is too great a level of detail for this House to involve itself in and it will merely lead to the ridiculing of the European Union because this is just the sort of interference which is deeply unpopular with many citizens across the European Union . #% Finally , with regard to the earlier answer to a question from my colleague , Mrs Kinnock , about our obligations under the Cotonou Agreement to extend market access for ACP countries in terms of the trade negotiations , does this not fly in the face of those promises and call into question our commitment to development in those countries ? #% Finally , this Parliament passed a landmark resolution on human rights in Colombia last October . #% This is the Prime Minister of Turkey today . #% That was the reason for bringing forward this proposal . #% We know the Commission is going to suffer but we are trying to ease the situation slightly . #% Bulgaria previously set itself the target of concluding negotiations by 2004 with a view to European Union membership by 2007 . #% We should have made the target binding then , and we really need to go forward now and find ways of making it possible . #% Because if it is so , it strikes me as a little like trying to repair a severed artery with a band aid : too little too late . #% Two years ago today the Erika was a symptom of a failed system of maritime safety . #% The Commissioner says there was an article in the Herald Tribune from Sandy Berger , but was that the real answer to the question of why Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn the Treaty this time round ? #% Mr President , the tragedy , as the Commissioner indicated , is that we still have a deadlock over changes that might deliver the real objectives we identified in Doha , which would allow countries - as others have said - to have the manufacturing capacity to export cheaper generic medicines to countries in need . #% They are being granted licenses to act for the Commission in accordance with Community rules , under the supervision of the Commission and responsible to it . #% But there is nothing more likely to cause observers of the European Union to yawn or sigh or say , ` oh , no , not again ! ' , than talk of the Lisbon Agenda . #% Was this because civil society organisations were not consulted or because civil society has such a low absorption rate ? #% We really must make the most of the fish that is caught . #% Registration for candidates is due by 21 February , and I salute the courage of the United Opposition candidate , Alexander Milinkevich , who will be restricted in his campaign to two 30-minute TV and radio interviews , whereas Mr Lukashenko will spend what he likes and appear as Head of State on the media daily , accusing his opponents of being thugs or Western mercenaries . #% Our consistent campaign against the death penalty , whether in the United States or China , Iran or Japan , is to be welcomed . #% Paragraph 10 calling for self-regulation by the press also touches on an important and topical issue and there have been attempts not to debate it in this Parliament . #% Therefore , what do we make of the memoranda of understanding which are increasingly coming into play and have implications for other areas of EU policy ? #% I have tabled an amendment which I hope will achieve that and I urge colleagues in this Chamber to support this amendment . #% I would also want a strong emphasis on improving the post-legislative phase , monitoring far more closely the way European policies are put into effect on the ground . #% 
I am pleased to acknowledge the key role that Parliament has played in shaping this decision and the requirements that will accompany it . #% However , I have to say to Mrs Schörling that I can not accept Mr Lannoye 's fourth amendment . #% Any change to the own-resources decision will require unanimity in the Council between the parties involved and the Court of Auditors will not be one of those parties . #% We note the Commission 's undertaking on the provision of information about these assets and expect this information to be delivered . #% I urge the Iranian leadership to reflect on this and to find solutions commensurate with Iran 's dignity and history . #% In my work I have sought to clarify the text , to improve it in some aspects , but to be very selective about new provisions . #% Nor do they provide for liability rules to cover farmers who are victims of such contamination . #% I am pleased he will be an observer at the Convention but I would say to Commission and Council that you would do well to listen to him as well as to allow him to observe . #% We do not favour the increase in biotech research if that is going to be looking at embryo stem cell research or GMOs . #% In the case of this report , however , the situation is reversed , because in the main the technology is available to clean up the small engines which , as Mr Lange says , can produce more pollution in one hour than a car travelling 150 km . #% Furthermore , this House expresses with one voice its total support for the peace process in Guatemala . #% I shall , of course , watch with interest over the next weeks and months to see how the United Kingdom Government disburses those funds , but it is clear to me that , with the increasing evidence of extreme climatic events , these issues are going to occur with a greater regularity throughout the European Union , and it is clear that , when expressing solidarity , it is in fact speed of response that is the most important element in that mechanism . #% It is clear that we want the release of all those political prisoners , that we want freedom of the press and we want the judiciary to be able to operate freely because , if all those with stated commitments to democracy are locked up , who else is left out on the streets ? #% We must do all we can to protect them and humanitarian aid workers around the world . #% I reflect with considerable sorrow at the dying-away of many of those fine words . #% We often find the greatest problem is not the original legislation but how it has been transposed by Member States and the speed at which they have transposed it , how they have implemented it and how they have enforced it . #% I know that the idea Mr Brown mooted was not well received here - or indeed in the Commission - not least by members of his own party . #% Turkey 's candidature is a defining moment for the Union . #% Let us welcome that move and congratulate them on their achievement . #% We need transatlantic partnership for the benefit of world security . #% The danger is that if we set a quota at the wrong level , in three years ' time there may be no more fish to set the next quota for . #% Moreover , I believe , the situation is getting worse rather than better . #% I would like to know whether or not he feels that poultry imports from countries like Brazil give cause for serious concern . #% One of the Commission 's fundamental aims throughout the negotiations on the contract on the Berlaymont was safeguarding the interests of the European taxpayer . #% However , all of this is based on a series of false assumptions . #% Combine the two : ditch the banana import scheme and make individual Member States sort themselves out with their own arrangements . #% I suggest we take a look at this . #% The current amendment reads : ` Supports the Commission 's efforts to raise awareness among multinational companies of their social responsibilities , which have as yet had little effect ' . #% We have made that mistake in the past . #% It was clear from our discussion that those Member States who allow their national parliamentarians early involvement in the process have far less difficulty implementing Community legislation . #% Thanks to conciliation , collective agreement will now need to be the route for an extension to annualisation . #% I am sorry also that too many companies in my own country have failed to look to the future and want to continue producing dirty , polluting equipment instead of investing in the future and setting the highest standards so that they can compete properly across the world . #% Mr President , Copenhagen has been the place of many controversial summits but none will be more so than next week when the camel of enlargement approaches the eye of the needle of European domestic politics . #% Road safety saves lives , as Commissioner Verheugen commented , and is so important to the well-being of many families in the European Union . #% We need the OECD talks to continue and to produce success . #% I got no answers then , but now it seems I have some . #% That you can stand up and boast about the fact that you were elected in secret and that somehow this gives you democratic legitimacy is the most bizarre concept I have come across in my entire life . #% I understand what you are saying about the need to first ratify the protocol , but can you tell me if work is beginning on certain specific areas where we can look for progress in the short term , so we can make people even more confident that these are not just words in a Treaty , but will actually result in specific action ? #% There are some of Mr Lehne 's amendments which are entirely sensible and we will support them but , I am afraid , not the majority . #% But this was unusual . #% Thanks to the hard work of the Conciliation Committee and those in this House who have been working on this directive , we are on the point of an agreement with the European Council , and it is a pity that we were not able to get it on the agenda for this week . #% Anything which includes the word radiation is bound to be fraught with difficulties , misunderstandings and misgivings . #% I must say I find it a bit rich for the Prime Minister of Belgium to come along here and tell 24 other nation states what they should do . #% But when it comes to performance , the EU is the bottom of the class for efficiency . #% Lastly , we must maintain the arms embargo on China , with its lamentable human rights record and threats to Taiwan . #% Perhaps he might be able to confirm to the House that he would be delighted to speak with his colleagues , including Her Royal Highness Princess Anne , to suggest that we take the resolution of this House seriously and that we press for what we are calling for , which is 16 days of peace . #% Mr President , a short question sometimes provokes a lengthy answer so I apologize in advance for what must unavoidably be a fair degree of detail in response to the honourable Member . #% As regards `` catch-the-eye '' , what is on the table is a compromise . #% It is equally impossible to imagine any legislative or non-legislative proposal that would not fall under those three strategic priorities . #% To make something retrospective and apply to what has happened in the past is bad . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the Commissioner for her statement and I agree with almost everything she said . #% These changes are being considered properly and democratically in a process of consultation and negotiation . #% Not only are unlawful killings in wartime on the increase , but equipment is being misused by soldiers , paramilitaries and police to kill , wound and commit terrible atrocities against civilians in peacetime as well . #% The EU must again provide support to ensure a quality procedure : another task for an asylum agency . #% I regret that Mr Ford wants to make this a political matter , because I believe this is something on which all political parties could work together for the greater good in order to stop this horrible trade . #% You have not pleased us , because , as you would expect , the main point of departure for the British Labour delegation is the implied reference to the United Kingdom rebate . #% It is clear that consumers are becoming more conscious of the origin of the food on their plate and want honest food labelling . #% I refer to the tragic events on the Israeli-Jordanian border yesterday . #% We are wholly in support of Amendments Nos 1 , 3 and 18 , tabled by Mr Cabrol , and those on the issue of voluntary donation , which have been tabled by my group . #% Which net recipients from old Europe are prepared to receive less in order to show solidarity to new Europe ? #% I represent the South-West of England , where we have spent more than GBP 1 billion -- I am sorry I am not speaking in euros -- in clearing up the bathing beaches around the coast of that region of England alone . #% It was mentioned many times that initially the European public prosecutor would be the first stage only to protect the Community 's financial interest which would then lead on to much greater things . #% I particularly welcome his reference to the analysis unit , which would assist the EU in drawing up a more effective common foreign and security policy and help with conflict prevention . #% However , there is a wider issue at play here , which affects the good functioning of Community law . #% Such a proposal would , for a start , need an amendment to the Treaties to be made now , while we are still in a period of reflection about what to do as regards Treaty amendment . #% Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process , but also the possibilities . #% 
It is also important to have derogation for essential services delivered in the interests of the public , no matter the nature of the body that delivers those services . #% All of us would have written it slightly differently had we had to write it ourselves , but as a compromise package it is a distinct improvement . #% Every year , 1.5 million children under five die from vaccine-preventable diseases . #% But , as we have heard , it is a particular ordeal for the 275 000 women who contract the disease each year and , tragically , the 88 000 women who die of the disease each year in the European Union , and their families . #% We need to be generous . #% Secondly , the mandate . #% We should restrict visas to all Mugabe 's associates and his government and identify those individuals with foreign bank accounts and freeze their assets . #% The application of this directive will vary from country to country . #% The industry , to be fair , has made giant strides in reducing both the number of animal tests and the number of animals used in such tests . #% No one can yet be convicted in Europe of illegal activity , but the weight of evidence suggests that European law has almost certainly been breached in a number of Member States and applicant countries . #% That said , the European film industry is important , both as a vehicle of European culture and as an important wealth and employment creator . #% We need at least another year . #% It would be foolish for us to publish our report in advance of the information that report is likely to contain . #% Mr President , this is a very sensitive issue and Mr Liese and I have crossed swords on it , which is sad because we belong to the same Group . #% The message we need to give to the Council is that the budgets we vote here are serious and prudent , but they have political priorities . #% Incidentally , mention of the wall was noticeable by its absence from the UK Presidency 's . #% It is time to launch peace negotiations . #% The idea that we should try and prevent needle exchanges , for example , will simply mean more deaths , more blood poisoning , more AIDS . #% Make sure they are properly in force and please learn from the UK ' s past mistakes . #% A new investor has made a commercial investment in the marketplace . #% Secondly , if the Commission alone guaranteed budgetary neutrality , the adoption of the scheme by the Council would be very unlikely indeed . #% It has already done excellent foreign affairs work through Romania 's chairmanship of the OSCE and made excellent progress in its relationships with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . #% The Green Paper and the rapporteur can but guess at the speed of change . #% We spend our time congratulating each other late at night , with only the Commissioner to hear us . #% Commissioner , thank you for listening . #% Yet as we speak in this Chamber , the human rights of men , women and children are being violated . #% I was delighted to hear the presidency today say that it has supported in the past , and will support in the future , Parliament 's demands for more transparent and legitimate trade policy-making in the European Council and the European Union . #% Mr Trakatellis and I assist you , Mr President , in that work . #% Not only do we care about Parliament having those rights , but we believe Parliament should be able to use those rights . #% Through you , Madam President , perhaps I can appeal to all the Greek Members of this House to see whether we can produce some form of joint statement in support of those principles which might advance understanding and lead to a quicker resolution of this issue for the 12 individuals involved . #% We believe that in a number of areas which are contentious - for example , the dangers of non-ionising radiation - not enough is known within the science for us to pass this by . #% Mr Dupuis has spoken of atrocities which I find horrifying , because these atrocities are happening to real people ; to grandmothers , grandfathers , mothers , daughters , fathers and sons for no reason other than that they are different . #% Mr President , firstly , I should like say that I do not like the fact that the two largest parties prepare joint reports as a matter of principle . #% I tabled this because Mark Forrester , my constituent , was convicted in Belgium after the Euro 2000 match , even though the British Intelligence Service offered video evidence to the Belgian authorities showing him walking away from the problems and the violence . #% Instead , we are told we must go to war in order to destroy Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction . #% It is important to train North Koreans in modern industrial and clerical skills and we need to give aid in a non-nuclear energy sector as well as raising the textile quotas . #% One could wish , on occasion , that its reports arrived rather more promptly at the Petitions Committee . #% Information is a term used since the earliest times of radio to distinguish signals from noise . #% Christianity has been an important contributor to European values but it does not hold a monopoly on them . #% The Court of Auditors particularly notes progress which has been made in the fields of agriculture , research , energy , transport and education . #% In particular , window frames have been mentioned . #% Let us act , for heaven 's sake ! #% The compromise on the two contentious issues , namely time allowed for setting limits and the right to return contaminated feed to the country of origin with the consent of that country 's government , was realistic and workable . #% I propose in the resolution that this process be supported through the creation of multi-stakeholder committees by country or region , a proposal which is meant not to increase bureaucracy but to ensure systematic means of participation by NSAs . #% A chance to hold the executive to account surely must be welcomed . #% I think we may have problems with this machinery directive , but the Commissioner must address that . #% The example from the West is that you bring in other people to do the investing and they take the cash with them . #% The rate in the 1980s was treble that of Peru and double that of Brazil and of all the tropical countries in South America taken together . #% One would not expect them to . #% Relations between India and Pakistan are indeed deteriorating , with Kashmir being a particular bone of contention . #% Wind farms are absurd . #% This is an essential plank of the Financial Services Action Plan . #% Mr President , whether it is a jumbo jet crash in an isolated Scottish village , a tanker wreck on an ecologically sensitive coastline , a terrorist bombing or a major civil disorder , the effectiveness of a response depends almost entirely on advance planning . #% That approach was wrong and it failed . #% As it stands , it will only apply to workers covered by Regulation No 3820/85 and will therefore leave out a number of categories of workers , including workers driving vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes , regular urban transport drivers , taxi drivers and drivers of vehicles carrying no more than nine passengers . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to thank everyone for the helpful and constructive way that we have conducted this debate today . #% The Commission 's external assistance programmes account for nearly EUR 10 billion this year , and the priority task of the Community delegations is to administer these programmes properly and efficiently . #% Many developing countries feel that free trade has not in fact been as free for them . #% Member States should be free to set their own tax regimes and decide their own priorities for infrastructure charging and improvements . #% I am very concerned indeed about the reference that the President made as to who would be present from the Council when the President of Austria attends this Parliament tomorrow . #% The measure applies provisionally while Parliament and the Council go through a legislative procedure to review it , amend it or repeal it , depending on what we decide to do . #% Mr President , I wish to join with the others in thanking our redoubtable duo , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , for their excellent work on behalf of Parliament during this budget procedure . #% However , I also have to express concerns regarding the legal base and scope . #% One theme of the hearing was redress for injustice , and it is not possible to have justice without truth . #% Despite the world 's poorest countries joining hands to make the Doha Round a development reality , they were put in the impossible position either of accepting a text which left much to be desired , or of being on the receiving end of the finger-pointing blame game which plagued progress . #% If we agree part-national financing the required spending must be mandatory . #% 
The timescale set out in the report ( 2008 ) is thus completely unrealistic . #% The world is not safe while there is an ungoverned hole in the heart of Africa . #% We invite the Commission to comment on how they can ensure value for money when they are planning such a massive increase in expenditure . #% Considering all the other calls on resources , they might question the value of that , especially when we add funds for combating climate change . #% It is of great importance , as has already been said , to the financial services action plan and to the better functioning of the internal market . #% in writing . - By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 ( with 54 abstentions ) , the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times . #% And how long before the current EU budget - which is capped at 1.27 % of the Member States ' GDP - is deemed to be insufficient to stabilise a single currency zone , particularly after the imminent enlargement programme , which is presumably going to start by 2004 , and particularly if there is an asymmetric shock to one of the Member States , which will need bailing out by some central EU fund ? #% It seems remarkable that this could be so misrepresented . #% We have now given consumers seven working days in which to change their minds . #% I wish to ensure that my constituents are free to enjoy the millennium without fearing the morning after . #% It bodes extremely ill for the improvement of law-making for that to be the case . #% If these amendments are passed I would hope that the Commission might still reject them . #% It is not twelve years - it is nine years and we must state that very , very clearly . #% Secondly , it stands out that the Commission clearly feels that it is above and beyond the law . #% It also shows the benefits of having someone with strong expertise and background in a particular profession in this case , in the acting profession , on the stage someone who is a creative artist , who knows the subject , and of being able to combine that with the engagement of other colleagues . #% Mr President , on behalf of the one of the authors , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , I should like to express the total support of the PSE Group . #% From the United Kingdom 's point of view , it means that there will now be access to international data that will help in the fight against international cross-border crime , which we all take very seriously . #% Indeed , about 30 000 people are marching in Strasbourg today , wanting to protect the markets in which they operate . #% You might - if you are a Christian - call a it sin that so many people involved in industries , just because they are considered self-employed , do not enjoy the protection they deserve . #% This report suggests that it be phased out over a long period . #% Your obsession with creating this euro-state means that you are happy to destroy democracy . #% Mr President , I absolutely agree with Mr Deprez . #% We will find lines where it will go ; we will ensure that it is put on those lines where it can be spent ; and that will make a joke of our strategy . #% We have an amendment here which also protects , I am very glad to say , those who are selling products where the total price is not the unit price . #% In the economic sphere , the new Member States bring vitality and experience of the need for economic reform . #% Given that charities almost invariably provide services at a local level , they are a prime case for subsidiarity and national decision-making on the VAT rates they pay . #% Mr President , as a supporter of the coalition war effort , when I displayed my poster which read ` Saddam Out ! ' , I was told by Vice-Presidents Dimitrakopoulos and Provan to remove it , as it was apparently against the Rules of the House . #% As the Commissioner has said , we are discussing the review and updating of the regulation governing the operations of the Bilbao Agency . #% In my report before Parliament today I am asking for a common and wider interpretation of the Geneva Convention of 1951 , a clearer definition of who should be recognised as a refugee and one that is consistent across all 15 countries . #% Madam President , Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure says that we all sit here as individuals , not as agents of political parties and we do not take orders from outside . #% This resolution is an indication of our continuing concern but it is clear that President Reina and the government have already made some progress in dealing with problem and this has , in fact , been recognized by Casa Alianza . #% He had a huge contiguous cull of millions of animals that was completely unnecessary . #% I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan briefly with the Central Asian Delegation at the end of September and the beginning of October 2002 . #% The directive maintains that meat from poultry found to have LPAI is safe to enter the food chain . #% My amendment seeks to address the problems of competition distortion and secrecy , while supporting the principle of innovation . #% If there is better opportunity for scrutiny , we will in turn be willing to delegate much more readily . #% I very much welcome it on behalf of my group and , I hope , the whole Parliament . #% It has invested resources and interest in Cambodia . #% We need to shine a light into the murky world where exploitation could be rife and matters such as dual representation , whereby the agent can be representing a player at the same club that is trying to sign the player , need to be looked at . #% If you really want to help Africa , please , stop those deals . #% Following on from the points of order made earlier today , I am grateful the President is going to raise the issue yet again with the Greek authorities . #% It means being prepared to constantly update and upgrade , and it means border management which takes account of citizens ' rights of movement . #% Since then , we have seen a return to , or a continuation of , the destruction , the deaths , the displacement of people , and indeed the recurrence of bloodshed in a way that all of us in this House would have hoped would have ceased by now . #% I hope the Guineans have the resources to monitor what is happening when the EU fleet is there . #% Mr President , I believe Mrs Frassoni made a comment about voting on Amendment No 4 . #% Could you confirm that we shall continue until all the speakers have spoken , so that we can vote this morning ? #% Mr President , the callous slaughter of 45 people at Acteal in the state of Chiapas in Mexico shocked human rights workers round the world . #% But perhaps we could talk with you , Commissioner , and try to suggest ways forward with the associations that run hostels and similar activities internationally , and find a practical way forward so that parents can be sure of their children 's security when they send them abroad so that we have a quick practical solution to this problem rather than a theoretical one in the long term . #% It is further right that this report identifies the fact that we need to promote this progress both positively and earnestly . #% We must remember that over the centuries and , indeed , even now many atrocities are carried out in the name of religion . #% Pakistan is also not fully cooperating with ISAF , allowing it to enter the tribal areas of the north-west frontier region where al-Qa ` ida is currently regrouping to threaten Afghanistan 's government and civil society . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the ALDE Group is pleased to accept the Corbett/Martin report which sets Parliament on a good path to shoulder its great responsibilities following the entry into force of the treaty . #% Just think of the economics . #% . Mr President , here we go again . #% Our first thoughts are , of course , with Graham and Margaret Johnston and with the other members of his family , to whom we send our sympathy and support . #% Mr van Velzen awaits the Commissioner 's response with interest . #% The court , in a decision that could leave the detainees in legal limbo indefinitely , said that foreigners had no rights under the US Constitution and could not invoke the jurisdiction of US courts to test the legality of restraints on their liberty . #% The partnership has been invaluable in proving that we can come to some agreement on this issue . #% It is not an amendment put forward by the PPE Group . #% All these aspects vary from one country to another and , listening to this debate , I remain to be convinced as to how these harmonising instruments will actually crack down on those who are really responsible and bring them to justice . #% How are these standards going to be applied and what assistance are we able to offer ? #% Madam President , it concerns what has been lacking in the Minutes throughout the week , namely there has been no reference to Mr Falconer telling us whether he is voting or not . #% Of course , air travel has increased over the years , as it is no longer restricted to just the middle classes and the rich . #% This Fundamental Rights Agency is not just another European body . #% You mentioned that we are under great time pressure . #% The phenomenon I am talking about is , of course , natural radiation . #% 
I would say to those who have doubts about this that you can not really enjoy even the narrow legalistic conceptions of rights such as freedom of expression or religion and so on unless you have employment , a home and the other basic requirements of life . #% Mr President , I hope the President-in-Office of the Council will indulge us in putting forward possibilities for the next IGC even if he is not yet in a position to react formally to them . #% It is a very real issue and one that will continue to be of serious moment for years to come . #% This continued harassment only entrenches , understandably , hard-line views in Gibraltar . #% Mr President , in response to the comments by Mr Titley , I would like to say that I raised the issue of the 30th anniversary of Britain , Ireland and Denmark 's membership of the European Union at the last part-session in December and asked our President , Mr Cox , what was going to be done to mark this . #% The conciliation meeting itself was conducted in a most efficient and cooperative manner and the delegations must be given full credit for a job well done . #% It would be quite absurd now not to proceed with the concluding votes on the Quaestors . #% But since the European Union and the USA share essential values , I can not believe that the US seriously intends to follow this destructive course of action . #% To achieve an alternative takes up to ten years . #% I would like to suggest that Amendment No 106 tabled by the Europe of Nations Group is inadmissible under Rule 125 ( 1 ) ( b ) because it seeks to replace the whole of the text . #% Careful management can bring down illegal and unsustainably imported timber . #% As we move to an enlarged Union of nearly 30 Member States in the next few years , we are in danger of entering into negotiations on the future financial perspectives in a situation where there is a gross imbalance in what Member States perceive to be their relative advantage . #% It therefore means that a new shareholder with perhaps only 30 % of the stock can not decide , without providing an exit for all the other shareholders , to pay themselves special dividends or to sell off assets cheaply to another private company that they happen to control . #% Will there be continuity from the HELIOS II programme ? #% Madam President , I ask if Amendment No 3 has been checked for admissibility , as it is wholly discriminatory on grounds of religion . #% My constituency has benefited considerably from the KONVER programme . #% I want to commend Mr Ferri on his report and , in particular , his emphasis on the road safety aspects . #% We therefore aim to mitigate its worst aspects . #% This , for the first time , suggests that the budgetary powers of this Parliament should be in comparison with their current status . #% That is a staggering 35 % increase , an increase which would simply drive that company out of Britain and into some non-EU country , possibly in Eastern Europe , possibly in the developing world . #% I fear that this is a little adventurous for my British group as yet but I believe the Commission could look at promoting the international baccalaureate . #% With whom in the British Government precisely are you negotiating ? #% I am grateful to the Commission for what it is already doing as regards Indonesia , particularly Commissioner Patten , who has always taken up issues about Aceh when we have asked him to do so . #% Investment in education and culture helps Member States to compete globally , equipping our young people for the challenges of tomorrow , and encourages creativity , innovation and mutual understanding . #% In terms of fishing agreements , the Union pillages third-world waters , instead of encouraging local industries . #% This is not a partisan report . #% How does this silly situation arise between Parliament and the Member States ? #% We also have the fact that HFC152a is flammable , which may cause some problems with regard to safety . #% Thirdly , the current chaotic situation regarding finance must end . #% We must accommodate some of the concerns expressed , for example the need for a proper transitional period to ensure that problems with mines closing prematurely in order to avoid the obligations of this directive are circumvented . #% If the UN sees this through , we will change international politics . #% It is right that we should look at how our regions are involved in the running of this Union . #% Of course the PSE Group condemns the cowardly ` twin towers ' bombings of the Gateway of India and of the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 that killed and injured so many people . #% Let us do all that we can to support them and the peoples of Sri Lanka , instead of attacking them . #% I would like to deal particularly with the issue of the stability pact . #% We have to take care when dealing with those issues . #% I hope that you , Madam President , will not consider inviting the President of China to this Parliament because that would indeed be a disgrace . #% One of the things that rightly concerns many of us is the extent to which this directive would encourage cross-border re-use . #% The documents adopted by the Commission today are , as the President of the Commission emphasised , proposals for consultation . #% China also has a nasty habit of sustaining brutal regimes like Sudan , Burma and North Korea , irrespective of the atrocities they commit , on the basis of non-interference in their internal affairs . #% At least it deserves a committee in its own right , as we had with East German accession . #% Sand eels are part of the food chain of the cod and these things are all linked . #% I wonder whether I could take over Mr Collins ' question , because I have an interest in this matter ? #% With respect , this is not the message this House should be sending to the Amsterdam Summit in June . #% The attendance at this debate this evening shows how close to the edge some of us are in danger of becoming . #% Firstly , it will enable the EU , independent of the United States , in association with its partners , to develop and deploy a global satellite system that will give an autonomous capability in this area . #% In order to do this , the directive proposes to require public undertakings and private undertakings that perform public tasks to carry out separate accounting procedures . #% They have defaulted . #% I am glad to see the Brussels Summit demonstrate that Europe is more capable of learning that lesson than the British Conservative Party . #% British Conservatives are abstaining on this resolution . #% That is why I say they have to be linked . #% Mr President , there have been several weeks for us to reflect carefully upon the draft Treaty establishing the Constitution . #% At the last minute there were some difficulties and the matter was reconsidered in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , but I believe that the difficulties and concerns that were raised have been adequately dealt with . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath on an excellent report and also thank my colleagues in the other political groups for the enormous amount of cooperation we have had in the formulation of this report . #% Mr President , I welcome the Karas report and the compromise amendments which we agreed . #% I hope the Commission will act swiftly on textiles . #% He referred to the Kok report , as I do in my question , but the report further recommended -- as he will probably be aware -- establishing a European research council , rather on the lines of the National Science Foundation in America . #% I also congratulate the Commissioners who have participated in this debate . #% The Council has finally moved to a common position which the large majority of Liberals are able to accept fully . #% It threatens to break up families . #% Recital B , for example , talks about energy consumption and highlights ` road transport , accounting as it does for 83 % [ ... ] of energy ' . #% EU supporters say it is all about road safety , but the EU is really all about money , power and control . #% That is the way to give our people new hope that Europe will contribute to their futures and that we can cooperate together to give new hope to other parts of the world as well . #% Mr President , that was an interesting contribution from Mr Batten . #% We are not but we are equally passionate on ensuring that bank 's democratic accountability . #% I would also add that many elements of our proposals are actually supported by industry . #% 
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- my simplistic outlook on life , I found the EU Constitution incredibly easy to understand . #% On category 2 , we are duty-bound to find a solution with the Council . #% I accept your offer and since we 626 MEPs are the contact between the EU and the public , would you like to write each of us a simple little letter making all of us in the Parliament aware of it ? #% But at second reading we are in a rather different position . #% The situation in particular in Byelorussia has deteriorated dramatically and there have been the most horrible civil wars and massacres on a massive scale in the Balkans . #% First , Hamas must renounce violence and recognise Israel 's right to exist . #% The balanced and measured agreement on financing arrangements is very welcome and places the Union in a strong position as we work towards Copenhagen . #% My group has deliberately voted to include unmarried partners if the Member State concerned legally recognises such partnerships , as I think three currently do . #% We are happy to vote for the report , given the circumstances , and with the reservations I have just described . #% My personal view has always been very supportive of Turkish aspirations towards Europe . #% Despite over three-quarters of the membership being developing countries , the WTO still pits heavyweights against flyweights . #% At one court a group of local people turned up and began to build a gallows outside the courtroom to make it absolutely clear that whatever actually happened in the court , the people would subsequently be lynched . #% We have heard much about that this afternoon . #% We should not confuse or reverse our priorities . #% I also say to the whole House that this is an important lesson to the rest of the world of what can be achieved in Europe when the political will exists . #% The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology . #% I understand that we are now receiving the detail by e-mail , but even that , as far as I can see , fails to mention the legal basis and the timetable of each proposal . #% In the second half of August the WFP only received two donations . #% To some extent , of course , the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international . #% Research by the Dutch Institute of Environmental Sciences showed that use of phosphate-free detergents resulted in no improvement in surface water quality and led to eutrification worse , in many cases , than that experienced when phosphate-based detergents are used . #% What do the tests and the research findings say about the incidence of the disease in animals younger than 30 months . #% Similarly , Bulgaria has made great progress after a poor start but we noticed a Commission opinion that it is beginning to fall back . #% Our committee supports the extension of the scope of Regulation 1408/71 . #% Parliament has been adopting resolutions and the Council common positions since 1996 . #% Serbia certainly has much work still to be done , relating to judicial reform and the fight against organised crime . #% This could be composed in the same way as the convention that produced and composed the Charter of Rights with representatives of the European Parliament and national parliaments and governments . #% I would urge you , President , as one of your first acts , to support the proposal that a political dialogue takes place urgently with Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party . #% Could we please vote on that first , before we come to the separate issue , that Mr Schulz has just spoken on , of Amendment 1 by the UEN Group to replace , in English , the phrase ` Hitler 's Nazi death camps ' with ` German Nazi death camps ' . #% As regards the question of chemicals in products , I accept the view expressed in Parliament 's report that we should start to look very closely at this issue . #% Mr President , I was struck today by an article in The Wall Street Journal ; the subtitle read : `` Why do America and Europe differ on the importance of consumer interests ? '' #% I realise that we English-speakers are spoilt with Sky , CNN and BBC World , but it is not the same as having the domestic channels . #% In addition , the directive means that pension funds can now invest , taking into account their own beneficiaries ' requirements rather than arbitrary rules set down by governments for the purchase of their own bonds and so forth . #% At Lisbon the Portuguese presidency gave us the key to unlock a decade of sustained innovation , competitiveness and job creation across our continent . #% I understand that Mr Blair is personally phoning around British Labour MEPs to try and twist their arms so that they do not vote against . #% We all recognise that the system should not be overburdened with too much bureaucracy , and we have acknowledged the need -- certainly in some sectors -- for self-inspection or inspection with a light touch . #% But I have questions on budgets , on Cyprus and on further enlargement on which I would like further clarification . #% This guarantees social cohesion across Europe . #% Finally , one of my disappointments at Durban was that with the spotlight on international diplomacy rather than domestic records , the European Union struggled to find the space to highlight its own growing and increasingly solid record in tackling racism . #% Of course , such imports include remunerated donations and there is no evidence at all that they are any less safe than unremunerated ones . #% In particular , my Group supports the move not to set recovery targets based on an arbitrary number of grams -- 160 grams for every country . #% Therefore , surely , Question Time can not be closed ? #% I was first alerted to this problem for MS sufferers in the UK during our 2001 general election campaign when one of our Conservative candidates was approached by a young lady in Nottingham , Mrs Peel , who had just been diagnosed with the disease . #% Thirdly , there is a lack of coordination : not just coordination among ourselves but with the national parliaments . #% I would also like to know why the environmental assessment will take place after the start of the project . #% The difficulties faced originally are being overcome because of an arrangement between the social partners . #% On the brink of historic decisions for Europe and the introduction of the euro , we should step back and contemplate and celebrate the remarkable achievement of eleven Member States qualifying for EMU . #% I only regret that it was not possible for Commissioner Loyola de Palacio to be able to speak to us - it had been our wish to hold this debate at the next part-session . #% We must give it our support . #% Romania , in common with other candidate countries in this two-part but single enlargement , has made substantial progress and her progress has been particularly marked since December 1999 when the new government took office , after the Helsinki Conference . #% It seeks to solve problems in state-run ports that simply do not exist in Britain . #% For the Verts/ALEGroup , the control of working time is also about who controls your life , and this working time directive applies to employees . #% I am completely open about that and always have been . #% First , for Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation to be a success , it is necessary for legal certainty and even-handedness to apply to commercial relations between Chinese business and firms from outside . #% I accept that , technically , the amendment went through and there is nothing we can do about that , but I would say that , politically , the vote does not represent the will of the House , which was expressed in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs on Monday evening , when a similar amendment was wholeheartedly rejected . #% We live in an imperfect world , and the use of thresholds reflects the reality . #% However , I want to make it clear that to many Members of this Parliament , across many different committees -- I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation -- this piece of work on corporate social responsibility is extremely important . #% Finally , I hope that tomorrow the House will vote for the environmental protection recommendation which Mrs Read introduced at a late stage as an amendment to the report . #% When we hear of Britain 's new leadership of Europe we anticipate a new surge of xenophobia tempered , perhaps , by American advice . #% Mr President , I also think it is very sad that the Commissioner is not here today for what is probably the most important debate in the fishing sector over the next few years . #% We are not suggesting calls for proposals . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate our three rapporteurs - Mr Hatzidakis , Mr van Dam and Mr Grosch - for the work they have done . #% It also plays an important political role supporting the promotion of human rights and democracy in third countries . #% Personally , I absolutely accept the need for a cap in allowances in each Member State although I acknowledge that some of my colleagues in my group are concerned that the requirements being placed upon their nations by the burden-sharing agreement are already onerous . #% I shall bend over backwards to do my bit and I will start by giving thanks to the rapporteur for all the work he has put into this . #% I hope , with the support of colleagues in the vote today , that we can make it a little shorter . #% I thank Mrs González for her work . #% 
That way lies folly and further trouble . #% They were insisting , as they continue to do - as you know , Commissioner - on implementation . #% You can rest assured that everything will be done to promote this matter as effectively as possible under the Irish presidency . #% Mr President , God help us if the conservatives ever run Europe again . #% The key is the protection of human health . #% I challenge the Presidency to implement such a procedure before its term of office ends and I look forward to the Council 's answer in this matter at Question Time following this debate . #% Travelling around my Lincolnshire constituency I often see pigs out in the fields enjoying a very normal active life with high welfare standards . #% We could not vote for resolutions that purported to give the European Union the power to conduct foreign policy or that were inconsistent with our policy of neutrality on the conflict . #% As the honourable Member who raised the question will know , in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance , each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party . #% There are , however , some small start-up businesses which are high-risk and I agree with the Commissioner that they should continue to attract a high capital charge . #% The benefits for us all will be seen in increased child life expectancy , cuts in population growth and improvements in farm production . #% Once again , a great deception is being attempted . #% I also voted against it in the conciliation committee for this reason , even though we did manage to dilute many of the dafter amendments during that committee process . #% Individual requests , as called for in the amendment for particular needs , must surely be the way forward . #% How many more days do we need to have a decision ? #% We must be tough and then we will succeed . #% I agree , however , with some of the critics who say that the proposal in front of us will not provide a lasting statute for the development of campaigning political parties , which are an essential factor should our vibrant transnational European parliamentary democracy flourish . #% Mr President , it was not only courteous of the Swedish Prime Minister to come here , but also rather courageous . #% We must remember that a fraction -- albeit a very small one -- of these car thieves have very serious ulterior motives . #% But even if it was relevant to only one person , we would still be acting , I am afraid , years , decades , after the time when we should have acted . #% There are over 2 million refugees outside the country and some 5 million internally displaced persons , many of whom may flee if hostilities break out between the US and its allies and Afghanistan itself . #% The legitimacy of such a body to override national judicial rulings would be questionable , and the judicial discretion of Member States ' legal authorities should be preserved . #% Norwegian stocks remain in good order . #% Thirdly , how the current policies of the European Union and its Member States help to create refugees . #% How do you stop some employers paying less than they might because they know the benefit system will make it up ? #% That would allow colleagues with an interest in Genk to make their points . #% Another area which reflects interinstitutional cooperation , which is important in Mr Costa Neves ' report , is information policy , where for years we have been trying to get good value for money , and for years we have met with little success , to say the least . #% In Britain , 70 % of people are opposed to joining the euro . #% Mr President , there are already some doubts about the viability of the nuclear industry in a liberalised energy market , as witnessed by the problems of British Energy in the United Kingdom . #% Yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed . #% There are certain points upon which PPE-DE Group opinion is divided , in particular point 11 . #% Why try and hide the full level of banks ' exposure to sovereign debt , especially when we all know the likely reality ? #% It is vital that the candidate countries maintain their efforts to come up to the required standards . #% Acting to help victims of this catastrophe rebuild their lives , homes and futures is surely something that any Member of this Parliament with a shred of humanity will agree on . #% So Mr Barroso is saying , on the one hand , that democracy is good , but on the other hand , that we can not have it in Europe . #% Let us look at the practical implications . #% The CAP features in passing in this report , but there is no mention of the destructive effect of the imposition of that policy in my country . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group and as president of Parliament 's Inter-Group for Animal Welfare and Conservation , I want to say that I strongly support Mr Pimenta 's report and hope it will be adopted by Parliament . #% I sincerely hope we are going to vote for this directive and include self-employed workers . #% Mr President , this is part of the health package put together with the food law legislation , and I salute Mr Schnellhardt for what he has done over many years in this regard . #% If the Lisbon Strategy has not sunk , why do we keep needing to relaunch it ? #% The problem will be if they continue to test the Taepodong , which will have a range of something between 4 000 and 6 000 kilometres . #% While bigamy is still illegal in the UK , polygamous Islamic wives are officially recognised as dependants for the purposes of tax relief and benefits payments . #% The EPLP also fully supports reform of the UN Security Council , in order that it better reflects today 's world , and calls for further improvements in the way that the EU speaks at the UN . #% This legislation is an essential building block and foundation for the success of those measures still to come . #% Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe . #% I agree with Mr Lund about Mr Nisticò 's amendments . #% Although I recognise the strategic importance of this region to the EU , I believe that continued engagement on the EU 's part must be matched by advances in human rights and democratisation in Central Asia . #% We want to encourage innovation . #% But its meaning remains crystal clear . #% I also welcome Commissioner Hubner 's promise of a study on the contribution of cities to regional development and the UK Presidency 's apparent intentions to make urban development a specific objective . #% I am sure that , like me , he is deeply impressed with the vast amount of support he has received from his colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and that side of the House in the list of speakers before us tonight . #% I also object to the gratuitous and unnecessary references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which Conservatives and many others have consistently opposed . #% Some reports indicate the possibility of serious food shortages which could produce great waves of violence . #% We had the Greek tragedy earlier on this year , and now we have the situation in Ireland . #% However , we have to be realistic . #% An appropriate way to deal with them is through the hygiene regulations per se and not in these additional monitoring provisions . #% Mr President , most of the contributions in this debate have been about the big global issues that appear on our television sets . #% Mr President , I am sure that a number of Members like me will be alarmed at suggestions that France is considering a ban on Muslim girls wearing headscarves in its state schools . #% It seems to me that , post-Constitution , some in this place -- and I am one of them -- will not recognise that new rule of law because we will only be able to leave the EU on the terms of the EU . #% We must put a ceiling on the aid to larger cereal farms . #% If she had known how to work the system better in terms of nuancing it , she would not have been caught by resigning four days before moving . #% I realise that if there had been a historic background of trying to keep confidentiality to a minimum , and transparency to a maximum , then it would be easier for this House to understand that , when it is critically essential that we use confidential procedures , it is done for absolutely the best reasons . #% I am pleased that in committee we had 110 votes and the Liberal Democrats were on the winning side in 103 of these , striking the balance between the two alternative views . #% I have to apologise because I believed that another colleague would raise this at the time and I expected a ruling on the admissibility of that paragraph from you . #% While the Tories continue to play politics , however , Labour continues to work , with the support of the NFU , to get the ban lifted . #% 
There has been significant progress , and most recently we received a very positive document detailing changes in the financial regulation and the staff regulations yesterday evening in the Committee on Budgets . #% But that is not to say that mortgages should be excluded from the directive , merely that one has to look at this problem again and see how it can be embraced within the overall context of the directive . #% I do not underestimate the scale of the tasks that the Commissioner faces with China . #% As two speakers have already said , the tourism policy has suffered and must be allowed to get under way . #% Again , my group would agree with that , but we want to make certain of this , which is why safeguards are necessary to ensure that there are no abuses by the authorities either . #% Furthermore , those responsible for the release of GMOs should bear full financial liability for any damage to human health and the environment . #% For the 2011 budget , some attempts at making these savings have been made . #% The second point I would make is to underline the point made by Dr Jackson . #% However , you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note . #% Perhaps he really has helped to kick into touch this awful Constitution . #% And what has the Commission done ? #% First , France and Germany are not the European Union . #% We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits ; they should be . #% Some finance ministers are arguing only for take on their side and no give . #% in writing . - Some of us are very much looking forward to being addressed by President Klaus in February . #% Mr Putin is sensitive to criticism , and a word of caution should go out from this European Parliament and be carefully noted by colleagues , even if they are not present in this Chamber at the moment . #% First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response . #% Would he be expected to pay social contributions to cover his spouse , thus enabling her to qualify for maternity leave if needed ? #% Instead of questioning basic rights , such as the presumption of innocence and habeas corpus , and possibly colluding in torture flights and extraordinary rendition , we need to raise standards , not lower them . #% If you wish to adopt a text or an amendment , you vote in favour ; if you wish to reject a text or an amendment , you vote against ; if you want to do neither of those things but show that you are present here , you can always press the third button - the abstention button . #% Our pensions proposals , meanwhile , fulfil our undertaking to guarantee the long-term actuarial balance of the system and , naturally , existing pension rights will be honoured . #% I look forward to the Commission and the Council accepting that text . #% That is what it is , and I would ask Mr Lamberts and his colleagues to please call it that next time . #% Only then can three close neighbours - Israel , Palestine and Jordan - build real prosperity for all their peoples . #% Is the scientific committee and the Commission going to look at that ? #% Does she not think that the EU really ought to be tackling the challenges of both racism and homophobia in their acute form of violence and hatred across Europe ? #% We see an America under attack - one which we recognised on 12 September in this House , but which perhaps we now fail to recognise six months on . #% Mr President , I asked Mr Patten a direct question . #% And yet , Mr Van Rompuy , your plan seems to be that we are losing , we are failing , but let us have more of the same ; let us have more Europe ; let us have more failure ! #% We have a duty to help not in an intrusive or invasive way , but by removing legal , physical and psychological barriers . #% Sometimes it is all too common that in order to signify the importance of a subject more money is offered to it . #% Are you not a little concerned that there is no chairman at the moment ? #% The whole thing has to be taken in that context . #% I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner . #% The seventh point , which I mention with a certain pleasure , concerns the ability to ban and detain certain ships - banning the most dangerous ships , particularly those that fly the flags of blacklisted flag states . #% We were there , we were players . #% Other issues included SPVs , the insolvency issue and captives . #% I am all in favour of the equal treatment of men and women in the eyes of the law . #% I do not think we have got that balance right . #% Sadly , this remains an aspiration rather than a reality . #% Tomorrow , this House will be considering a proposal that it effectively rejected in November 2003 . #% On every occasion I have emphasised the importance of this enlargement process for the further development of the EU and its contribution to the strengthening of democratic structures . #% Furthermore , Member States would reserve the right to operate more restrictive national export policies while working to adopt the common list of military equipment covered by the code . #% Madam President , I should like to welcome the Commission 's proposal warmly , on behalf of my Group and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% It must also respect the need for other types of labelling , such as those concerning quality . #% That will be the key success of the European Union . #% Mr President , we are going to have to wait and see what the Council makes of the points we are raising tonight in relation to the legal basis . #% If you wished to construct a series of amendments to cripple and disperse Europe 's industry , large and small , you could not devise anything more mischievous . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , with Mrs Hedkvist Petersen 's report and also with Mr Vermeer , has given a lot of support to the approach the Commission has taken . #% Those meetings have now been suspended by the Chinese . #% I want to highlight what we as a Parliament asked for in the first reading and what we actually got . #% Having a wider package might make it easier to reach agreement and easier to ratify in our Member States but I can say , on behalf of my group , that we are willing to have Parliament work closely with the Commission in the spirit that Mr Barnier has just indicated , so that together we can put a balanced package of proposals on the table of the IGC that he , and our representatives to all the meetings of the IGC , can defend : a package that will make the Union fit to work when it has more than 20 Member States . #% Therefore I am extremely pleased to congratulate Mrs Cederschiöld on her report and the recommendations contained therein . #% In this report Mr Napolitano , as befits the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and rapporteur , has most skilfully woven together an approach to improving relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments and to strengthening cooperation between them . #% When this recommendation from the Commission was presented to Parliament , it was very quickly clear that it was a flawed document and indeed the Commission accepted this itself . #% Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters . #% I hope the Commission and the budget rapporteur will look very closely at their pleas and make sure that Euronews is a success . #% After all , as Galbraith said : ` Money is not superior to democracy ' . #% We welcome the proposals to hold elections later this year . #% I therefore believe that we should follow the US model here and set the maximum effective dose limit at one microsievert per year for everybody . #% Mrs Hedkvist Petersen implied that the industry was not taking it very seriously , but I know from my visits that it is . #% Today -- which has been very much a day of celebration -- it is important to remember just how far we have come in the European Union in a very short period of time . #% Although I do not expect anybody else to support that , I hope those who disagree will understand that in a democratic society when you make a commitment to people who elect you , you try and comply with that commitment when you get elected . #% For this reason , and many others , I am pleased that British Conservatives will be part of a new political group in the next parliament , dedicated to reforming the EU and challenging the prevailing orthodoxy of ever-closer union which has proved so unpopular and caused so much damage in my region of North-East England . #% Therefore , do not sympathise with them , but lend them the Commission 's political clout and support and enquire of the Member State as to whether it will release information that is essential to these people in terms of ensuring that they are not at risk and that their lives are safe and in good hands . #% The French Government , as far as I know , has no new evidence . #% 
We need to make sure our work is well coordinated and coherent , but we must also capitalise on our respective strengths . #% I start , as I believe everyone in this House starts , from the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty . #% What sort of signal would this give Russia at a time when we look to Moscow to play a positive role in assisting with peace talks on Kosovo . #% It seems that we are putting things off for no reason whatsoever . #% The 6 - and 12-mile limits must be confirmed permanently . #% I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety . #% Mr President , a year ago British Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed this House and asked a vital question : what sort of social model is it that delivers 20 million unemployed across the EU ? #% My name has been put on various lists and the spam comes in . #% All that has to happen is for this information , when necessary , to be immediately communicated to the governments concerned . #% Many of the economic , political and social problems that we identify stem from that single fact . #% Mr President , I am pleased that the Commission has produced the action plan on lifelong learning , new technologies , access to the built environment and so on , but we need to go much further . #% I also find a lack of realism about the whole idea that somehow we want to impose a particular business model on broadcasting . #% I know from my own personal experience with family members that this vote today can alter the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the EU . #% In spite of the Israeli occupation and the lack of opportunity for East Jerusalem residents and others to vote , this election prepares the ground for the Palestinian parliamentary elections in July and could serve as a model for others in the region . #% Eritrea has never held a national election . #% The aim of the Commission proposal is to improve the control of low pathogenic avian influenza so as to prevent an outbreak of the high pathogenic type . #% Mr President , I would just like to remind the House that we must be better behaved on Fridays from now on as we are being televised for the first time for a long time . #% I think it learned a lot from our experience in Rome with their workshops and their visits . #% Finally , I believe that we will get a result , after second reading , where we have substantial improvements in emissions from these plants , where we have substantial improvements in the environment and in the air quality around these plants . #% This is made marginally worse by their attitude to international adoptions . #% I do think this is an important debate in the context of the current economic climate . #% And if there is a query about implementation it should be prepared , given the current political climate in Europe , to give unequivocal answers . #% I know the political constraints that Member States are working within , we are all serious about - as you put it - the principles of cost efficiency and rigour . #% The European Union must demonstrate that it can achieve the same vision , imagination and commitment by significantly raising its own financial contribution and offering real European leadership in tackling the most devastating global challenge of our times . #% Let me make it clear that bank loans are absolutely crucial to this sector of business and European support with minimum bureaucracy and targeted at job creation is a very effective way of offering support . #% New procedures must be agreed by both institutions . #% If it makes it less attractive to invest in competitive networks at local level , if it strengthens the position of existing incumbents , if it detracts from the opportunities for the local consumer who make primarily local calls and favours those who customarily make more long-distance or international calls , it really will not have served our purpose well . #% Our preference is for unremunerated donation - that is the British practice and that is what we want to see - but , in practice , Europe imports nearly 50 % of its plasma and plasma products . #% The European Parliament is coming of age . #% When they read of new measures against poverty our poor hide their purses . #% Mr President , three previous resolutions passed by this Parliament since 1990 have been ignored by the Israeli Government . #% We are confident that Croatia and Italy will find a successful solution to the specific problems referred to in the honourable Member 's question . #% In other words , leave immigration control to the Member States - a policy that my party supports - and address the failures of existing policies . #% As Mrs Wallström has said : The real and immediate danger in the Balkans comes from general environmental degradation following years of neglect , corruption and war . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , it behoves Mr Watson , if he is making a suggestion that we should consider the recast implications , to explain to us now what the recast implications are . #% On the second part of Mr Harbour ' s question , he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change , not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission , as the President briefly outlined in his statement . #% It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two . #% As well as wanting to see an independent OLAF , I would like the Commission to consider the possibility of one of those Commissioners assuming responsibility for budgetary control and the internal audit service of the Commission , because the sooner it is separated from the budgetary function itself , the sooner we may start to make headway as regards these problems . #% Can the Commission look into this matter urgently ? #% Even with that type of statement , we will not be in the same situation on trying to find the funds for Category 4 for next year . #% As Ms Wallis said , we must close the loopholes , learn from what has gone before and improve the position next time , especially as it relates to the activities of the Commission . #% Mr President , I welcome many of the things our Commissioner has been saying and is proposing to do . #% We call for legitimacy and transparency from our partners , yet we suppress the truth when it legally obliges us to act . #% What about the French , for whom this measure will cost an additional EUR 916 million a year ? #% Clearly that role needs to be developed , not just for historical or sentimental reasons . #% Could the same apply for the Committee on Petitions so that we can have dialogue between the Council and the members of that committee , as happens in other committees of Parliament ? #% We need to develop a common and comprehensive definition and concept of security and risks to security . #% Madam President , I welcome this proposal . #% Taxpayers whom I represent across the United Kingdom 's capital -- in Barnet , Enfield , Croydon -- are concerned that the tax they are paying , which is channelled to the European Commission , is not being properly accounted for . #% I supported Commissioner Nielson when he made proper criticisms regarding the management and efficiency of the former liaison committee of EU development NGOs in Brussels . #% PVC windows have a long life - in fact , none have been recycled yet because they have reached the end of their useful life , but only because buildings have been demolished or because fashion has changed . #% All it requires is that we know about quality and content . #% Now , once again , there is a problem with hormones . #% This is something that the Commission recognises and , working together , as Mr Pérez Álvarez has said , we have tried to do something about it over the years . #% The Commission may have made conscious efforts to communicate with observers in Hong Kong , but that is no substitute for the direct input of elected parliamentarians to redress this clear democratic deficit . #% That majority will largely reflect the views of the people across the European Union . #% What do these people get up to , I ask myself ? #% Many arriving in mixed flows may well be economic migrants , which does not make them criminals . #% But these authorities are neither independent , as it is claimed , nor free to act . #% They are not clearly organised according to the priorities , but seem to have been organised artificially into two categories . #% The Commission proposal needs significant revision . #% Ironically enough , however , the advent of peace means that the attention given to the area is likely to decline quite steeply , despite the fact that many of the underlying problems have by no means been resolved . #% My colleague from Poland seems to have ignored that entirely in what he said just now . #% Mr President , in the previous debate in September last year I confirmed that health and safety was an important issue , and I commended the rapporteur on the thought that he had put into his work . #% Amendment 141 , by the Liberals , however , muddies the water and takes away precisely the legal certainty that Amendment 53 sets out . #% A positive position there will be a strong assertion of Treaty obligations and the humanitarian response of the European Union . #% 
No doubt this can easily be corrected . #% Mr President , I would like to ask a question please . #% Regarding the contributions of Mr Titford , I assumed he was speaking in a personal capacity . #% It seems to me that we are confronted with a very difficult choice tonight because we must decide if what we vote tonight is at least in some way acceptable to the Council . #% Iraq , by contrast , has shown us that a single , majority voting policy , much less one that could be communitarised , is wholly unrealistic and will result in division and animosity by all parties . #% But we should not be surprised at the limitations on the powers that are left to the domestic governments in Euroland because it has never been a secret of those founding fathers of the single currency that what they had in mind was the creation of political union and a united states of Europe . #% Mr President , it is always a great pleasure to follow one of the Commission 's chief apologists . #% You will be aware that a consultation document went out when the last government was in office . #% On 16 October the European Commission agreed on the proposal for a stability pact to ensure budgetary discipline during the third phase of EMU . #% We have heard from colleagues from different countries who have said they feared this would happen . #% Member States ' exclusion of this small territory from the right to vote reflects no credit on them . #% I would also call on the Greek presidency of the Council to summon the Nigerian Ambassador and make plain to him the feelings we hold so strongly in this House against such an unjust punishment . #% A.Q. Khan and the leaders of Pakistan , supposedly allies of the West , have done more to make our world more dangerous than any of the ` states of concern ' or the whole ` axis of evil ' together . #% If we move on from harmonisation at nought-percent vegetable fat , which has always been in the campaigning argument , we move to a position where we ask for safeguards for consumers , for the primary producers , and essentially for the standards that we set ourselves in the European Union . #% All too often , however , the aim is to establish a monopoly position over important market sectors to maximize profits , and the poorest farmers in the world are either further impoverished or put out of business completely . #% Can the Commission , as it says , complete the linguistic and administrative preparations for enlargement during 2003 ? #% Last week I met a group of ten members of the Rada who were in Brussels to learn of our institutional relationships . #% The European Union sends diplomatic missions to southern Africa but they come back empty handed and leave behind no impression that action against Zimbabwe is a high priority and a determining factor in the overall approach to southern Africa . #% Could the Commissioner please outline what criteria she will be using in making that assessment as to whether to bring forward a recommendation ? #% That means that the Council and the Commission must listen to Parliament 's views and respond to them , because it is clear that Parliament wishes to see measures that are both ambitious and more targeted . #% Therefore , on behalf of the Thule survivors , and in the hope of future work to review the Treaty , I commend the report to you , unamended . #% The references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which our people do not want , and the proposal that the putative Commission Vice-President/High Representative should co-chair a new ` Transatlantic Political Council ' , are examples of this . #% I would be interested to know what provisions you are making for the future . #% The Minister can rest assured that this Parliament is equally as pleased as he is that he is here again today . #% It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union . #% She recognised that by investing with Lloyd 's and becoming a ` Name ' - I should explain , for non-Anglophone listeners , that means a passive external investor whose affairs were managed by Lloyd 's as approved agents - she recognised that she was exposing herself to unlimited liability . #% She was a recognised democrat and historian . #% Unless we are careful we will see a very dangerous discrepancy develop between what is decided amongst the great and the good and what needs to be encouraged and explained to the electorate . #% For several years many of us have toiled to bring the single currency to fruition in the belief that EMU will help Europe in its search for jobs for its people . #% It is important in terms of support for the more vulnerable , for carers , those needing care , those needing support for independent living , and indeed it is important for pension levels . #% The Commissioner 's comments on this , and on Mr Herman 's excellent report , would be illuminating for this House . #% We shall simply have to wait to see what views are actually expressed . #% All this Parliament wants is a clear and comprehensible system . #% Steps need to be taken to make the EU budget more flexible . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by again thanking the rapporteur for this very necessary report . #% What steps will you take to ensure that this report , whether it is troubling or mundane , becomes the property of us all and can not be expunged by a powerful lobby ? #% At the beginning of this year there had been optimism that the ceasefire agreement would be reinforced and that substantial progress towards peace would be achieved . #% There must be a bilateral solution , urgently required , supported by the new Dublin II but reached through pragmatic bilateral agreement . #% We lost nearly half-an-hour this morning and many of the points of order that were raised then , and are often raised here , are things that Members have just thought of that they would like to share with others . #% SAB5 should be imminent because of the Commission ' s needs for payments but within the resolution that we will vote on we will insist on an SAB5 and an extra 15 posts for OLAF . #% For several national leaders , this means that they will be obliged , for the first time , to campaign on European questions . #% Marco Polo is a positive move but , on its own , it is clearly nowhere near enough . #% As my colleague Mrs Westlund said , people are fed up with buying so-called low-fat products only to discover by reading very carefully that they are high in sugar or some other ingredients . #% I think now we must allow time for this package to be transposed : to implement it and see how it works before deciding whether anything is needed . #% This is the final part of the Erika package so we also ought to thank the Commissioner , who has been working relentlessly to ensure that disasters like the Erika and so many others in EU waters in recent years do not occur again . #% I personally believe that an equitable full and final settlement based on partition and the ` land for peace ' principles we see in the Middle East would be the best way forward . #% So what we are actually seeing here is the final stage of implementation of the CFP . #% However , we believe there are serious issues which still need to be resolved before Croatia accedes to the EU . #% I have two concerns following the President-in-Office 's statement . #% The time for that is certainly getting very close . #% Perhaps it will be possible before the summit on 4 October to reopen this issue at the General Affairs Council next week . #% Whilst I appreciate that the OLAF and Spanish investigation is ongoing and that Mrs De Palacio may be totally exonerated of any involvement , the fact remains that she was a little economical with the truth when answering my questions on 30 August . #% Under the Commissioner 's proposal we face the position where we will be able freely to establish marketing agencies in other countries , but they will not have a common set of principles . #% Let us not pretend that the Emissions Trading Scheme is somehow going to curb aviation emissions to a great extent . #% -- Mr President , I wish to make two points , and they both concern money . #% Nobody believes you . #% The additional funding is consistent with the pledge made by the Commission in Tokyo last January . #% We want to see greater civilian and democratic control and we want to see greater respect for human rights in Indonesia . #% How will they explain to their councillors at local and regional level that they are weakening their role in determining the provision of services of general interest and safeguarding the public interest ? #% It is alleged that local authorities have tried to force highlanders to renounce their deeply held beliefs . #% The cost impact assessment in the original proposal is inevitably inadequate . #% I would say to the President-in-Office of the Council that if the key thing that comes out of the Luxembourg summit meeting is simply the facility from the European Investment Bank , and if that is what we are all putting our whole emphasis on , that is not what this summit meeting should be about . #% The peace process is not an option ; it is the only way forward . #% Indeed , the call for a more balanced order , whereby social issues are considered on a par with economic concerns , whilst long over due , is most welcome . #% Thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgets - though it would have been nice if the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control could have contributed more to this process - by looking at our own cost benefit analyses , at the Court of Auditors ' reports , at the budget forecast alert and at the synthesis reports provided by the Commission , we have been able to identity a number of lines which we unanimously have voted into reserve at 30 % on first reading in the Committee on Budgets . #% It had the widest possible support in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , and I regret that the GUE/NGL Group has chosen to re-table amendments that were rejected by the committee . #% 
What happens if this conciliation fails ? #% However , we should also question whether we are not creating a more tangled legal web and a two-tier system of justice , one for cross-border cases and another for so-called internal cases , as with the legal aid directive . #% I know there are some issues about privacy , but let us be clear that this system works only when it is triggered in an accident and is not a device for tracing where you are when you are driving . #% So it is very important to have in place a system which will give the greatest possible reassurance to members of the public in the event of a nuclear accident . #% We can not possibly support a regime that carries on this intimidation . #% Finally , we must , I think , as Mr Wiersma has said , avoid the trap of constantly reciting history in this dispute . #% History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation . #% This is exemplified by British Prime Minister David Cameron , who this month took a 48-strong trade delegation to Beijing but failed to include anyone to represent an interest or expertise in poverty reduction , environmental degradation or labour rights . #% I am pleased to hear what Mr Schmit said on that . #% On the DAS , I appreciate the difficulty which the Court has , because we have not allocated sufficient manpower for the double job to be done and it is putting up a good show with short resources . #% You are quite right to say that there are areas of decline and areas that have suffered greatly because of lack of activity and changing circumstances . #% Parliament , at the moment , does not appear to be very democratic . #% It has nothing to do with citizens ' freedoms and rights , and everything to do with a monstrous power-grab by Brussels . #% We do not want legal proceedings between our institutions for the sake of having legal proceedings , but we do want to do something that enhances the position and standing of Parliament and Europe 's institutions . #% Then we stand back proud and happy that we have solved the problem . #% As well as putting money into infrastructure and the environment we have to think about the people . #% The moment we break budget discipline , we open a whole Pandora 's box which is liable to bring the whole project collapsing to the ground . #% Not surprisingly , therefore , Mr Fischler 's colleague , Mrs De Palacio , has expressed global reserve on every aspect of the proposed reform and I share that global reserve . #% I am thinking here of the Balkan states in particular and neighbouring countries such as Ukraine which need anchoring in peace , prosperity and western security . #% The ENPI must remain part of the codecision procedure under Article 179 , with suitable monitoring and oversight by our Parliament . #% When she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search . #% For example , we wish to remind the Commission of the need to achieve higher standards in auditing the research programmes , particularly in the context of the European research area proposals . #% Everything that goodwill and intelligence and flexibility can do I promise , from my committee . #% And then those safe products are sustained in production by proper quality systems , not just for the toy itself , but for all its suppliers . #% Too much of the debate has been about apportioning blame for what has happened in the past and too little of it has been about looking forward . #% There is still one slight uncertainty in the text about what happens with regimes , for example , in Spain which have insolvency proceedings which kick in before the contract law actually takes place . #% I have to say to the President-in-Office that the net impact of the various measures the European Union has imposed since 1996 has been very limited : the Burmese have not entered into dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic forces in Burma remain as outside the whole process as ever . #% It would be a mistake for this reference to nuclear energy to distract attention from the main thrust of this report , which is about improving energy efficiency , drawing more supply from renewable sources , and integrating our environmental objectives in our energy policy . #% The proposals appear to be rather vague and the graduation extension must be fully explained in the Commission 's legislative process . #% As Mrs Oomen-Ruijten correctly says , this is a new departure and one which I hope will be taken up in all countries including my own . #% Along with my British Labour colleagues of the PSE , I voted in favour of the underlying principles and sentiments of the Ceyhun report . #% Mr President , while of course the liberalising thrust of the Lisbon process in the Barcelona Summit is welcomed , I would like to bring to your attention two warnings . #% That , of course , is the right response . #% The actions of the Portuguese Government must not and will not go unchallenged . #% I speak as an honorary member of the South Essex Chamber of Commerce having close contacts and met in recent weeks with the Thurrock Industrial Association and the Basildon Business Association and just last Friday participated with representatives of over one hundred local companies at the launch of Business Link Essex . #% I hope that in private the Presidency is saying something different to its 24 EU government colleagues than it is saying here . #% I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax . #% One unnecessary death from smoking is one too many if we can prevent the deceptive peddling of the products which may cause it . #% There was a real sense when we arrived in Cancún - as confirmed by this revised text - that the vision , promise and ambition of Doha was being seriously threatened , because matters of substance on agriculture , cotton and the new issues , which are important to developing countries , simply were not being addressed . #% I say : Let it be now . #% Ideally that should take the form of an association agreement , although the Commission -- and I have to say as ENP rapporteur , I might agree with this -- might logically argue for an ENP neighbourhood agreement instead in the first instance . #% I would point out to him that the report is about the adoption of measures concerning the repatriation of mortal remains . #% in writing . - I voted for this report despite my disappointment at Amendment 10 by the Greens calling for the introduction of an EU-wide financial transaction tax . #% Large stocks of illegally imported Chinese chicken meat have been uncovered in the UK over the past few days . #% I have particular concerns , as she knows , with the market investor test . #% The coordinator of a support group of one such rare disease , Action on Tracheotomies lives in Billericay , in my constituency . #% I am confident that Parliament will also support him in this . #% The Commission also notes Parliament 's concern about the need to improve cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities responsible for implementing secondary legislation . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I have been a long-standing critic in this House of the lack of human rights in the People 's Republic of China . #% I welcome the fact that the European Commission is placing increasing emphasis on giving resources to support the development of an AIDS vaccine . #% Studies , for example , by the UK Consumers ' Association show that one in four people now visit non-conventional practitioners by choice . #% We should note that , even before the adoption of this directive , the Court of Justice in various cases held that works councils were parties concerned for the purposes of merger control proceedings . #% The public tends to complain to us , not to the Environment Council . #% Could you explain what they are , Mr Friedmann ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , first of all , may I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hökmark , on skilfully piloting this report through the committee and achieving a very broad measure of consensus . #% He would certainly have an afternoon 's entertainment hearing what people really think . #% Mr President , it is indeed a shame that Mr Farage is no longer with us . #% Madam President , although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken , this creates a very dangerous precedent . #% Why is it that the Ethiopians do not leave ? #% Madam President , I rise on a point of order under the Rules of Procedure which concern the possibility for Members of the House to ask the President-in-Office whether he would give way . #% I suspect you are doing that because you do not want to do the real critical analysis of whether this project is working . #% Clearly there is much work , collectively , that we need to do on this . #% It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation . #% This is what we called for in Parliament 's resolution and I would ask you to use your best offices now to bring that about . #% I hope you will look into it as a matter of urgency and remove all ashtrays from all the no smoking areas as a matter of course . #% It is also rather surprisingly still enjoying an economic growth rate of 4 % . #% 
Madam President , I tried to catch your eye before this last roll-call vote . #% Is there any possibility that the Commission might propose that the Union takes on a responsibility for guarding our eastern borders ? #% As we are about to vote on the Tillich report , should not those Members who are in receipt of EAGGF monies ensure they are declared and refrain from voting . #% I believe that the so-called privileged partnership is a false prospectus designed to drive Turkey away from integration with Europe . #% We need to make sure that there is venture capital available for small and medium-sized enterprises . #% A change to the funding proposed by our committee aims to give a minimum to each state , which could be used to promote public awareness . #% New responsibilities should be accompanied by new rights . #% Mr President , while I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work I fear that , as the road to hell is paved with good intentions , so it is with this Charter . #% Many of us in this House know as well as anyone that getting a visa can be a time-consuming and expensive business . #% So we will know exactly what the legislative programme for the Union will be in February 2007 . #% I urge you to support them . #% We want to see a break with that link to poverty so inevitable for people with ill health and disability in developing countries : no wealth without health , but no income without medicine . #% I believe that Mr O ' Sullivan has a very strong commitment to the direction set out by the White Paper and will be a notable successor to his extremely talented and committed predecessor , Mr Trojan , who will take up a new post from the end of this month . #% In the UK is called ` It 's a Knock-Out ' . #% Too often , animal welfare provisions of this sort are thwarted at national level by the argument that ` if we alone do it , we will put our producers at a competitive disadvantage , and production will simply shift to less scrupulous Member States ' . #% I hope that on this issue and related matters we can move forward as a result of the response by the Commission , and help reduce the number of abortions , by giving women access to the services they wish , should they wish them . #% And , thirdly , there is the dispute settlement system itself . #% I wonder if it might be possible , exceptionally in this case , to have their statements translated into the official languages promptly . #% Many are aware of the failure of the quota system to conserve , manage and regenerate our fish stocks , not least because of the high proportion of discards which must be thrown back and are no use for conservation , no use for fishermen 's income and no use for the consumer at home . #% The rules on investment should be about more than economic liberalization and should include a very clear commitment to sustainable development and to long-term quality investments . #% We support the additional measures advocated in the original report . #% My Group has continually pressed for reforms based on the Wise Men 's report . #% If colleagues agree , I would like to ask Commissioner Solbes to pass that message on . #% This is what the European Union needs to address while we monitor very carefully the results of medical testing . #% Here we are , nine years later , debating the fact that 21 Member States had , by October 2009 , failed to enact these directives and have now been sent reasoned opinions because of this failure . #% In September the charge was reduced , but only reduced . #% It is a shame that we have not been able to deal with this problem as what it is , a matter of criminal law , but have had instead to deal with it within the strait-jacket of the internal market context . #% I also find it difficult in terms of subsidiarity actually to say that drinking water quality should be something that we consider here . #% Thank you for those words . #% Mr President , budgetary discipline , sound financial management -- surely these words are alien to this place ! #% So when we are assessing the quality of education , we want to see if we can develop people who have self-esteem and confidence , who can communicate effectively , who can look behind the information for the hidden message , who can question , who can work as part of a team and independently , and who are creative , resourceful and have an appreciation of the wider world and their responsibility to it . #% We should not forget that in January this year Parliament passed a resolution asking that the Kuwaiti prisoners of war still imprisoned in Iraq should be released or at least that details should be given to their families and that there should be compliance with the United Nations resolutions . #% I recommend this proposal to the House . #% I was really pleased that the President of the Commission , in the statement that he made this week about delivery for our citizens , put the completion of the internal market absolutely at the top of the list . #% The four big companies together buy almost half the coffee beans produced around the world . #% We will work with the Commission to deliver an effective and workable directive that will be of benefit to consumers and citizens throughout the European Union . #% Similarly , the careful approach of these investors , with their application of the principle of due diligence , means that spontaneity is not a part of the risk equation , as one might have first imagined . #% And yet we in the EU tend to regard Poland as having inefficient agriculture . #% My first point is addressed to the Commissioner and concerns B-1 items where the Commission pays an enormous amount of money for subsidies for growing rice , bananas and the distillation of wine . #% That is cheating and must be rooted out through a policy of accurate and random testing . #% I note that the Commission document - the so-called ` Penelope ' document - uses the term ` institutional law ' for its English-language version , which is at least a little clearer . #% I therefore welcome the thrust of the resolution and the need to do something . #% How anyone can argue that this is a plan that will support the peace process is baffling when only 1 % of the US contribution is set aside for this specific purpose . #% And then you want to renegotiate Britain 's rebate and we will lose a further GBP 2 billion a year ! #% The proposal in question allows Portugal to exempt itself from the obligation to cofinance the amounts it secured for itself at the December Council . #% Ken Saro-Wiwa believed he would die ` all for Shell ' . #% If we can not take effective action to disarm Iraq then the UN is finished as an effective force and the big countries will be acting unilaterally to the detriment of world peace and stability . #% Foreign and security policy is the most sensitive area of national sovereignty . #% It is a directive which I and the British Conservatives welcome because it is vital that European citizens are given proper protection of their creative rights and creative works in the digital era and this directive will deliver that to them . #% As long ago as 1961 , President Kennedy introduced a code of this type into the White House . #% It could mean that a gay person could be refused a teaching job in a Church school , however devout they are . #% The Commission ' s proposal reflects the need to set up an instrument for the rapid , decentralised and efficient management of reconstruction aid in a way that takes account of the urgency of the situation and the exceptional efforts that are required . #% In effect , the Finance Ministers are seeking to suppress this Parliament 's role as a partner in the budgetary authority . #% I recognise the Commission 's worries . #% We are on French soil but the relevance of French law is questionable , as we are endlessly reminded that EU law takes precedence over national law . #% I am prepared to accept Mr Bébéar 's amendment , supported by the last speaker but one , with regard to the possible dangers of the new alcoholic beverages , the so-called alcopops . #% The Commission has made no such recommendation . #% We must get away from the 15 different systems I mentioned earlier ; however , we must ensure that Member States have an input , and in those areas where higher standards exist we must insist that they are maintained . #% Minced beef is as much , if not more , at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources . #% Whatever we are actually dealing with here is a virulent outbreak of public hysteria , generated by a highly contagious burst of over-the-top publicity from the national governments and the European Union . #% Mr President , as I have said often before in this Parliament , I am a former postal worker and remain strongly linked to the postal workers ' unions as well of course as primarily representing here more than half a million postal consumers in my constituency . #% Your work should also fit well with the communication announced in Parliament by Commissioner Diamantopoulou yesterday . #% Mr President , as Mrs Stihler has already said , this proposal is of major importance for Scotland . #% As regards the early retirement package mentioned by Mr Miller , the package we have now has retained its attractiveness for staff and its cost neutrality . #% One is the authorisation procedure . #% The process of European integration is driven by a small political class and is certainly not ` the result of a free decision by the people ' . #% 
As Commissioner Patten pointed out during the debate , it is not the `` Community '' which sets the budgetary ceiling , it is the Budgetary Authority . #% The welfare of the child is , and should be , at the heart of the adoption process . #% This needs to be thoroughly researched and quantified before potentially fatal accidents take place . #% The stench of graft is all around us and is getting stronger by the day . #% Whether it is the car industry working to reduce emissions , or universities creating strategic links , the success of promoting this agreement is measurable . #% It is time to bring this issue to a conclusion . #% The UK Government welcomes this report . #% As the rapporteurs say in one of their amendments -- and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteur , Mrs Herczog , for her work -- we want to ensure fair and transparent access to European standards for all market players throughout the Union . #% Persistent uncertainty about what has actually occurred and who is responsible for alleged war crimes and other violations of international law is fuelling fear and panic among the civilian population . #% It is right that we put something forward-looking on the table . #% Also , the doubling of the fiscal consolidation effort called for in the survey is going to choke off any possibility of achieving the 2020 process goals . #% The Development Committee also firmly rejects the language used by the Commission , which presumes that the proposals to rationalise the instrument have the potential to enhance either the coherence or the responsiveness of the European Union as a development partner . #% Mr President , I informed the services in advance of my wish to raise a point of order while Madame Fontaine was in the chair . #% I just want to say that everybody supports safety . #% Is this really what Monnet planned ? #% I am not sure whether we would go as far as Mr Monti - I believe he has referred to state aids in the past as evil - but we certainly believe that it is necessary to restrict state aid in order to maintain economic efficiency and economic prosperity and a level playing field between companies in different Member States . #% There is merit in the proposal for area payments . #% Because the Council has changed the original Commission proposal with regard to the role of the European Parliament from the consultation procedure to simply informing Parliament of any decision of the Council , I am bound to ask why the Council appears to be trying to bypass or circumvent Parliament . #% As our teams head off to Sydney they are under more pressure than ever . #% While it is tragic that discrimination , imprisonment , ill-treatment , torture , injury and death in flagrant contempt of fundamental human rights still occur , such acts are now widely regarded as criminal and many tyrannical regimes have in fact fallen . #% I also look forward to having a clear and detailed provision and would like to see a draft bill for us to debate . #% I hope that all groups will find that reassuring and adequate . #% This resolution looks at the security and safety arrangements ahead of Euro 2000 so that decent football-loving supporters from across Europe can go to , watch and come away from football games this summer without fear or concern for their safety : a fairly apt thing to call for considering the recent events in Copenhagen . #% It agreed , firstly , to reopen Council discussions on the comitology system in order to give Parliament the same rights of scrutiny and call-back as the Council . #% If I may , I would like to link that point to some of the important remarks that the President-in-Office made this afternoon . #% My Group can see no reason not to grant discharge for the 1996 budget . #% Companies need to know where they stand in relation to their national legislation and they also need to be encouraged to adopt best practice through codes of conduct . #% I want strongly to support the idea of a scoreboard which the Commissioner mentioned and of gestures to name and shame those Member States which are failing to meet the expectations of MEPs , of the Commission and of the public . #% To hear the President-in-Office spell out support for the role the European Parliament will play over the years in the supervising role of the European Central Bank is very welcome to all parts of this House . #% If we always applied this principle , then innovation , invention and inquiry would all go out the window and we would make no progress at all . #% Mr President , I join with others in warning that substantial change still needs to occur in Romania but that we reject the language of rejection . #% However , as a democrat adhering to democratic principles and procedures , I presented this oral question on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism as its Chair , which it is my proud duty to do . #% For these reasons , the ECR Group has chosen to abstain . #% We hope that the Council will agree to our amendments because we want sensible information in sensible format , which will lead to a better chance of people choosing a healthy diet and thus enhancing their own health and that of their families . #% The Ecofin proposals are a poor substitute for real action and came out of a two-day panel of experts meeting which I attended . #% Finally , I wish to refer to the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on sexual and reproductive health rights . #% Freedom of movement across the European Union is seen as the biggest single benefit of being a member of the EU . #% We discussed this issue when we met with members of the US Congress in our normal framework of delegations earlier this year . #% Many airports in the European Union operate night-time bans although not all do so . #% I did , however , agree to call for an emergency EU-Israel Association Council meeting to discuss the crisis . #% If ICAO will not deliver then the EU will have to develop its own emission limits . #% Mr President , first of all , should we hurry to forge closer bonds with Egypt , assuming that unanswered questions and miscarriages of justice will fade away and resolve themselves , before we have stopped and thoroughly examined what exactly is at the heart of the State i.e. the way it treats its citizens : the cases of fundamental human rights abuse , the 52 men put on trial for their homosexuality , for Egypt wanting `` to protect order and its national values '' , the conviction of 23 of these men , the repression of Christians by Islamic extremists which is allowed to go unpunished , the case of Dr Saad El-din Ibrahim and other intellectuals imprisoned for having used funds that we , the European Union , gave them . #% What is missing from the recommendations here , and the directive , is the provisions for Member States to apply moratoria that are not necessarily based on strict existing scientific opinion . #% There is a crying need , Mr President , for proper regulatory impact assessments to be applied to European legislative proposals . #% The week before last three Members of this Parliament - Angela Billingham , Edward McMillan-Scott and myself - wrote to the President 's Office to ask for urgent action to be taken on behalf of a number of citizens whose properties in Spain have been wrongly seized by banks - one of those citizens being my own constituent , Mr Frank Clark . #% Russia must also cooperate in the prevention of nuclear proliferation , particularly to Iran , and not sell Iran the S300 missile system to demonstrate solidarity with the west against this dangerous regime . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Herman on an excellent report which I think certainly has captured the imagination in terms of how we must proceed into the information age . #% No arrangements previously existed for this . #% Perhaps Mr Monti might be able to apply his skills in bringing order and synthesis to a number of subjects to this particular area . #% That has to be at the heart of the whole reform process that we keep challenging and asking for . #% We facilitate democratic elections in Palestine , yet we question the people 's voice when we hear it . #% If there was no decision , everything else is supposition . #% I assume lady Members may have received scarves , though I am surprised that we do not see any of the ladies wearing scarves here this afternoon . #% I would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now . #% We must be absolutely sure to see this revised proposal in that context . #% It is one thing to be e-mailed ; it is one thing to be lobbied ; it is one thing to be mass-lobbied ; but to endure threats of violence , bullying and harassment as she and her family have is something which this Parliament will not accept . #% My constituents simply can not understand why action has not already been taken on the basis of the precautionary principle , which the Commission so often cites in support of its initiatives . #% Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic . #% It is vital that those processes are taken seriously . #% We are talking about thousands of jobs . #% The best way to do this is by reducing trade barriers worldwide and by concluding trade and cooperation agreements conditional on respect for the rule of law , respect for property and contract rights and respect for human and civil rights . #% However , the postponement of the decision on this accord at this point at the end of this Parliament would not , in my view , be in the long-term interest of the Mexicans or of Europeans . #% There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text . #% The President-in-Office mentioned that the decision was taken some years ago leaving operators six or seven years to phase out duty-free . #% Some two weeks ago I was in New York talking about this report to the secretariat and I was distressed to learn that the whole process of UN reform , which was supposed to culminate in the year 2000 at the Millennial Assembly , is blocked . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is to be congratulated on the fact that in three months she has produced a wide range of consensus in Parliament , which I hope the Commission will note , on the substance of these proposals . #% 
The Government of Sudan is pouring its troops into the region and the extension of the African Union 's mandate by three months is only a breathing space . #% If the institutions are to be successfully reformed , which is vital if our citizens are to have confidence in the way in which they are run , it is a problem , as Mr Blak has said , that nobody seems to wish to take responsibility . #% I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves . #% We also saw the difficulty of wrangles over the appointment of the Central Bank Governor recently and over the President of the Commission four years ago . #% After all , it was the British Prime Minister who gave the green light to this misguided policy in 1998 and now he has promised significant elements of Britain 's already over-stretched armed forces to fill any capability gaps given the complete lack of willingness on the part of most other European countries to upgrade their defence capabilities in any meaningful way . #% Secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity . #% It is truly an achievement of disabled people working and campaigning together , and one that we , in common with our colleagues in the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform , want to see spread throughout Europe . #% Secondly , I turn to Mrs Stauner ' s excellent report and the explanatory statement . #% The committee is a brilliant interface between the citizens and the institutions and it brings forward solutions to problems at both EU and Member State level . #% It offers more power , more choice , lower prices to citizens across Europe and indeed across the world , and in my view the best thing that governments can do in cyberspace is to stay out of it as much as they possibly can and let consumers , businesses and citizens get on with their businesses and their lives . #% Part of this is the question whether or not people have a real choice , say in the UK with its opt-out , as to whether or not they work longer hours . #% This is certainly true of the foreign affairs field where the old certainties of the Cold War are now at an end and have been replaced by a situation of much greater uncertainty and insecurity . #% I hope our partnership will continue . #% in writing . - I welcome the positive vote releasing funding for the Abruzzo earthquake victims . #% We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in Europe . #% If we do this we will certainly minimize any kind of risks in the whole question of transporting toxic materials , but particularly , of course , nuclear material . #% When we look at the carry-overs from 1995 , we have something like ECU 9.2 billion of unused resources in 1995 , now being carried over into 1996 , which means that when Member States have to pay their own resources there will be ECU 9.2 billion less that they have to pay for this year 's budget . #% Could I first of all address my comments to the Commissioner ? #% Therefore it needs careful phasing-in and it needs to ensure that it is actually tax and revenue neutral , and no country is worse off by implementing this . #% Surely we should be following up some of those possible alternatives . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate mainly on the revision and just say to those who have been making comments condemning the Commission on the proposal for taking money from 1A : ` Let us wait and see what the PDB brings forward ' and not write off everything at this time . #% There is no such thing as a set of standards on integrated pest management . #% In conclusion , do not worship the new market gods of competition at all costs , liberalization and deregulation . #% We must not lessen our efforts towards Bulgaria and Romania , nor must they assume that 2007 is a guaranteed date of accession . #% It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget . #% Saddam Hussein still possesses huge quantities of biological and chemical weapons and three years ago he attempted to buy weapons-grade uranium from Serbia . #% They apparently admit to statements under torture , and there are no independent appeals . #% Mr Bradbourn was not even present at the vote , so it is a bit rich for him to go on about it now . #% Some summer recess ! #% In many cases cost is the only reason for which we do not have cleaner engines already . #% This report starts the process and points out many of the problems and poses many questions to the Commission . #% However , it is balanced by a negative point : we are still waiting for a common position on that proposal . #% I too would also like to welcome the new President-in-Office and ask if he does not agree with me that the trade boycott of Cuba by the United States actually strengthened the links between Cuba and the former USSR ? #% I want to focus on this question of reform because that is fundamental to our security in the European Union . #% However , I was also very pleased to hear Mr Barroso talking about dealing with unscrupulous employers . #% I would like to put one further point to her . #% The report clearly states one concern that Mr Nicholson has mentioned , namely that we have no regional government . #% There needs to be satellite control . #% Urgent action is required to improve recovery rates . #% I hope that his time in Brussels coincides with a quantum leap in terms of America 's relationship with us MEPs , and the announced visit by Vice-President Biden is an excellent start , because no one wants to see the transatlantic partnership strengthened more than I do . #% We have a regulation that fails to recognise the fact that alternatives already exist for most F-gas applications , that fails to promote substitution and that will set back the introduction of safe and innovative alternatives for years , not just in the European Union but in the developing world as well , where F-gas emissions are predicted to grow enormously over the next few decades . #% My call is for more research for neglected diseases and more support for care projects in developing countries . #% I abstained where there was no clear implication for UK interests , but where there were clear concerns for continental Member States - ` hot pursuit ' being that particular vote . #% The references to enhanced rights for third country nationals means , of course , rights for those who are legally resident . #% Colleagues may well hope this is the start of a great new partnership , but I suspect they may have to wait a little longer for it to blossom . #% The reality is that they would never be prepared to accept the proposal , whatever the wording . #% Although Conservative MEPs wish to combat corruption , we believe that this matter should not be legislated on at a European level but should be dealt with internally by Member States . #% These views are individually deeply and honestly held , as indeed are my personal and private ones . #% Amendment No 18 suggests that some financial support and incentives might be given to manufacturers . #% It is very easy to reach out and press this button , it should not be difficult for any Member . #% The figures range from 3 000 to 7 000 on one night ; 15 000 later on and 100 000 people still suffering from debilitating diseases . #% We all recognise that much still needs to be done if Bulgaria and Romania are to be ready for accession on time . #% In the future we may have to amend the directive to take into account the needs of commodities firms , if they are brought into the framework . #% Let us stop this crazy idea now before the so-called rich Member States end up totally impoverished . #% Does anybody have a veto on this date of 3 December or can you give us a guarantee that it is actually going to happen ? #% At the moment western military forces are operational in Bosnia , Kosovo and Macedonia , as well as in Afghanistan . #% I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report . #% I would also ask whether you think that it is appropriate that a country that has no direct involvement with the banana industry should be able to lodge a complaint in this way and to obtain a ruling of the kind obtained by the United States after they lodged their complaints . #% As a lawyer in the UK , I have had experience over the years of providing legal advice and support to people who have been victims of domestic abuse , stalking or harassment by a relative or a former partner . #% They have no control over the electoral roll , they have no control over the polling stations that will be run by government civil servants . #% Some have suggested that they should actually be required to retransport the people they have carried or remedy the situation . #% Small companies can have vast values , and it only takes one or two Nobel scientists on board to ensure that that happens . #% The setting up of the provisional legislature was at worst illegal , as the governor claims , or at best unwise , unjustified and unnecessary , as the Americans have claimed . #% It has been estimated that increased competition from cheap agricultural imports could mean that about 400 million rural Chinese will no longer be needed on farms by 2005 . #% I was surprised that the Liberal Democrats supported the move to include inland waterways , as this could have adversely affected the operations of ferries across the river Mersey , which they purport to support . #% The British Government has recognised that in its proposal because it will be the subject of a free vote , possibly later this year . #% 
I support him in his urge that we should limit the degree to which the annexes here can be altered by comitology . #% We were warned at the time of the part-working directive that it would cost hundreds of thousands of part-time jobs , particularly for women workers within the European Union . #% The role of the Commission has been mentioned . #% However , my worry remains with the players ' associations . #% We now need to bring forward a European-wide framework in which to control this . #% India 's economic growth is booming at 8 % and is set to double in a decade . #% I should like the Commissioner to tell us two things . #% Additional measures against imports are not justifiable on health grounds and I expect that the Commission will say the same thing . #% So we are in favour , but there are two things we want to add . #% The Government of Mexico must , furthermore , reiterate its declared commitment to a peaceful resolution to the conflict with the ZNLA . #% We have seen it all before : first the problem , a problem of huge legitimate , public and topical concern , then the meeting and then the solution . #% The Commission failed to consult , through the joint EU-ACP trade committee laid down in Cotonou , in recent discussions on `` Everything but Arms '' , whilst the long-running problems over the banana regime remain unresolved . #% These principles will also be a beacon to people in other parts of the world who want to take the first step on that long , democratic road . #% There are record amounts of heroin coming in , cocaine , attacks on the Internet increasing every day , trafficking of illegal immigrants , of women and of children . #% We ought to put this into some sort of context , though , and remind ourselves that the majority of people in the world have never made and probably never will make even one phone call . #% We will be presenting this book of condolence to his family at his memorial service , which will take place at Derby Cathedral on 29 January . #% Now the challenge is not only to the Commission , other colleagues have said that , but it is to the industry . #% The issue is this : since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 a large group of extremist Hutus have been hiding in a remote area of the Congolese rainforest in the east of the Congo . #% The call for all food businesses to be registered is also apt . #% Progress is painfully slow . #% We have great sympathy with what Mrs Corbey is trying to achieve with this amendment . #% It is bold and forthright in exactly the right areas , particularly on vaccination and import controls . #% I hope that clarifies the position . #% Finally , we need to make sure the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking is complied with . #% Ordinary men and women look to us to make their lives and their communities safer . #% Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its formations for economic policy and interior affairs ? #% I am disappointed with the outcome . #% But piracy remains a clear and present danger in the seas around the Horn of Africa . #% Following Parliament 's insistence on this point , Council finally backed down and agreed to its inclusion as part of the basic information collected from tourist accommodation establishments . #% I have sought changes in the regime from a budget control point of view , from a budget point of view , from a development point of view , from a WTO point of view and from a consumer point of view , which puts me at odds with Mr Fruteau , for whom I have the greatest respect and whom I genuinely admire . #% I welcome what the Commission has said today . #% It would be irresponsible for us as legislators not to pay due attention to what happens to our worthy texts once they are adopted as legislative texts . #% We welcome many of the recommendations in this report , particularly Conclusion 5 , where we are looking at this report being incorporated in future into an early warning system on Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaties , picking up petitions we have also had in the Committee on Petitions . #% What progress has the President made with this request ? #% I also want to enter a reserve on the issue of whether nanoparticles should be included in REACH . #% They are only being singled out because there is only a relatively small number of companies which still produce them in Europe and they are an easy target as far as the Commission is concerned , to make it look as though they are actually doing something about mercury , whereas the big sources of release of mercury - from power stations , crematoria , etc. - are not being tackled because , of course , to tackle them would be very expensive for Member State governments and local authorities . #% Imagine the language from some builders , for instance , if they were told to cover up when they were trying to get a sun tan for their holidays ! #% It does seem to me , Mr President , from the point of view of this Parliament , that it is perfectly possible for the Commission services in effect to deflect a question away from a Commissioner unilaterally , without the Member concerned having any knowledge of it . #% This improved network will also contribute to making Europe 's digital economy more competitive , in the hope of developing an innovative and creative environment that can foster future advances in digital technology . #% It does nothing for jobs or economic growth and widens further still the democratic deficit . #% The industry itself has to recognise that its service levels have been unacceptable and Member States must also recognise that investment levels have been in decline for many years . #% We think that it needs to be stitched into the other policy strands and can not simply be dealt with as an add-on . #% There have been very serious violations of human rights in China and this should be taken into account . #% Is it simply rigidity ? #% I know that Mrs Jensen , my colleague , will talk about James Nicholls and the fact that Mr Spring , the Foreign Minister from Ireland , has still failed to have any decent reply from the Burmese about exactly what happened in connection with James Nicholls ' death in prison in Rangoon . #% Although Zimbabwe faces expulsion from the Commonwealth on 25 July , the government seems more concerned with prosecuting a disastrous war in the Democratic Republic of Congo in order to safeguard Mugabe 's cronies ' diamond mining interests . #% The Connecticut Yankee was not particularly concerned about competition rules . #% It would be wrong to infer that only large-scale projects can reduce bottlenecks . #% There is one matter that has hardly been considered : we are leaving a host of issues here to the new Chemicals Agency , but we have no idea what criteria it will adopt or whether it will be lax or rigorous in its interpretation . #% This situation is bad for the environment , prejudicial to human health and damaging to the image of the Thames . #% There has not been a case - and I repeat : there has not been a case of BSE - in an animal born after 1 August 1996 in the UK . #% The report would have been wrong if it had not looked into it and then made a judgement because the whole principle of the inquiry was that we needed to know what had gone wrong - and things had gone wrong - and then put forward proposals . #% If these trends continue just 4 % of travellers will go by train at the end of the decade and rail freight will all but disappear . #% Why this House should be preoccupying itself with such minutiae is beyond me , unless it is yet another symptom of the European Union 's limitless propensity for control-freakism . #% We are beginning to see now an increase in aircraft registered outside the EU similar to the maritime sector ' s flag of convenience . #% I was proud to be the rapporteur for this House on joint investigation teams , as I know the Presidency-in-Office is aware , in 2001 . #% By the same token , I am also loathe to agree , when we come to vote , on a series of prohibitions on the use of F gases , which have not been tested or assessed for their health and safety , nor for their economic or environmental impact . #% The British presidency should take three immediate and crucial steps : to enforce the rule of law in this place ; to abandon projects which pre-empted the Constitution and now have no legal basis ; and to guarantee that no attempt will be made to implement any part of it . #% The human being is not a nocturnal animal and research demonstrates that the risks of accidents to health and safety are highest as a result of night work . #% Among the most depleted are the plentiful stocks once found in the North Sea and Irish Box , up until 1973 the exclusive province of British fishermen who looked after the fishing grounds and reaped a rich harvest . #% Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster . #% It is a priority and the European Union must do all it can to stave off one of the biggest threats to the global population - disease . #% How are you going to achieve that and ensure it works when there is the European Convention on Human Rights , and every smart lawyer will immediately say that he does not recognise somebody else 's ability to pass judgement and is going to appeal to Strasbourg ? #% First of all , a number of colleagues have said that in areas like goods and services , in particular , we have done a huge amount of work but that it is not well enough known ; people are not taking advantage of it . #% We would very much hope now that the Council will hold to this , as we have had a very clear exchange of letters and we should not then have the same misinterpretation in the 2008 budget . #% I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders . #% 
This is very much to her credit , and in this matter she has been very keen to share her insight and concerns with us and to invite us to contribute to it . #% Their only crime was to be visibly different from the majority . #% Madam President , to save time , now that Amendment No 70 from the Europe of Nations Group has been rejected by an overwhelming majority , could you apply the provisions of Rule 130 ( 7 ) , which states that the President may decide , following the adoption or rejection of a particular amendment , that several other amendments of similar content or with similar objectives be put to the vote collectively . #% We want to know which Member States are still resisting the concept of fair competition in the railway sector and deliberately protecting their own national companies . #% So I may not put a question to the President-in-Office ? #% Anyone who opposes such moves must be prepared to justify traffickers and paedophiles getting off scot-free . #% Since January 1999 there have been 1 200 attempts to target aircraft with surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft weapons . #% I do n't describe myself as computer-illiterate , but last weekend I thought I had better surf the net to see just what was available . #% Human rights are not a part-time occupation . #% It is timely , following the Commission 's announcement of approval for the ten candidate countries to accede to the EU and this weekend 's referendum in Ireland , which cleared a potential obstacle to the enlarged EU . #% However , it has to be the right kind of leadership and it has to be the right kind of future . #% I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report . #% So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues . #% The proposal achieves four important objectives . #% We are completely behind the plans to decouple payments away from production , and welcome the freeing up of agriculture . #% It will also create more problem-free driving , and we hope that will happen Europe-wide . #% Time and time again I have stood in front of you , Commissioner , and reflected on the finger-pointing blame game that has plagued progress . #% I have always had reservations about imposing a single model of justice on countries where there are different legal systems evolving in different ways . #% The Cyprus issue should be a matter quite separate from the candidacy of Turkey , but it has become inextricably linked . #% For example , we would prefer to see avoidance of the use of sonar in marine breeding grounds adopted as part of a common EU strategy . #% Nevertheless , without abandoning my reservations , I voted in favour of the report . #% Those are the things we should be thinking about when we are in Rome on 10 June , and that is why I ask for action and not just statements . #% I do not subscribe to the argument that Parliament should abdicate its constitutional right to improve this proposal because others have failed to initiate the legislative process in time . #% But it looks like we have got the victory of bureaucracy over national democracy . #% I have to say to Mr Pirker that I have been interested in what has been happening in Austria for some time . #% UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent , have real teeth ( such that the Commission has to take note of them ) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy . #% On refusal of entry , there will be clearer explanations of the justification of that refusal and the right of appeal once the appellant has returned to their country of origin . #% I would happy to go along with that . #% With regard to the so-called heavy M1 provision , I am very happy with the compromise reached . #% Consumers , too , are beneficiaries indirectly , as the best minds can be brought to bear to create greater trust in the answers to our joint concerns . #% Stop dreaming up new ways to increase the cost of producing anything . #% There can be no tolerance of the intolerant . #% We underline in the motion before you that we believe that this kind of issue should be dealt with in future through the codecision procedure . #% I have to take issue with many of the points that have been made . #% That right of initiative is only ever defensible if exercised in a fully accountable , transparent manner in which motives are fully explained and political accountability is fully safeguarded . #% Mr President , I should like , first of all , to welcome some visitors from Kent who we are fortunate enough to have in the gallery today . #% In the next two days we will try , with the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and our distinguished guests , to work out what the framework of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum would look like . #% However , we sometimes seem to either take each other for granted or let our family squabbles obscure our overriding common interests . #% I hope that at the end of the process our Parliament will be able to reach the right conclusions in the interests of our citizens . #% I have certainly benefited from discussions with them . #% I am pleased that ECHELON ' s existence is recognised and that the need for transparent international agreements is acknowledged . #% Prime Minister Blair should be especially congratulated for apparently discarding previous British Government positions upon defence . #% That is why I think Mr Lannoye 's amendment was an amendment too far in that direction . #% Yet New Zealand farmers are now amongst the most efficient in the world , in fact forcing other trade blocs to put up tariffs and barriers to their products . #% Mr President , in many of our countries terrorist organisations continue to recruit , train , raise funds , gather information and , indeed , carry out acts of terrorism . #% It is my view that the European Parliament spends too much time wishing it had more power and not enough time effectively implementing the powers it has . #% In future we will think of European legislation . #% We have to get the system working for the sake of all of the people who are moving around Europe . #% On a broader level , the committee wishes to stress the promotion of both sustainability and territorial cohesion with the need for an integrated approach that would embody appropriate spatial planning and foster coherence between the actions engendered by all sources of European funding . #% I hope that a deal may be reached between the PPE-DE Group and the rapporteur . #% Millions of people have lost their jobs . #% I know that my colleague Anita Pollack , under the auspices of the South-east Asia Delegation , has raised this issue on a number of occasions during visits and delegation meetings with officials from and in Pakistan . #% There are areas where we have our differences , such as in heading 3 where we have always had difficulties . #% However , the UK Labour MEPs and others abstained on this report and several of its paragraphs on the grounds that , while we support most of the measures proposed , they are not all preconditions for enlargement . #% We have also heard from some of those who are responsible for regulation . #% That said , I do admire your sense of humour because you are still banging on about the Lisbon Agenda . #% All agree that there is simply no other way to ensure the efficient allocation of capital on a long-term and global basis . '' #% It needs Member States to look at the situation and to try to address the position with compassionate moves . #% We are very happy to combat fraud and tax evasion and to improve social security legislation , but there are some points where there will be difficulty in convincing all the Member States to follow . #% A judicial decision in one Member State must have automatic application across the whole of the Union . #% That leads to a legal process lasting 18 years . #% The Commission and the European Union can play a constructive role in facilitating cross-border clearing and settlement as a vital part of creating a single market in financial services . #% Although I accept that this has been put in the context of what are called peacekeeping operations , I am still concerned that this is the start of a slippery slope . #% Parliament 's Environment Committee has put together a short resolution in order that Members can debate it with the Commission and we can attempt to get some clarification from them . #% But my understanding is that such powers exist in some EU countries . #% When they are in Member States they have the right to asylum and protection . #% 
To find ourselves in 2003 already discussing 2013 all seems rather far away . #% Winston Churchill once said that democracy can be inconvenient , but it is the best system we know . #% This monstrous waste of taxpayers ' money is cooled using HFCs ! #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Council for the detailed summit conclusions it gave us , as well as the appreciation that there was a real need to have a look at a long-term strategic view of the transatlantic relationship , taking into account security and political and economic aspects . #% Consumers will need to be assured , for instance , that once the ball of the single currency is in play , the double pricing in the euro and in the home money is the rule , not the exception . #% As a result the amendments in committee , which will in due course be largely subsumed in composite form , can nearly all be supported . #% I wondered whether , given its wish to take notice of consultation with the industry and to work with it , the Commission might bring forward a proposal to extend the limit , say , to 30 nautical miles rather than the 6/12 miles at the present moment ? #% I am sure that , as democrats , you would all welcome a referendum on the EU in the United Kingdom . #% This attempt politically to force them all to become one will , in my opinion , never work . #% As a result industrial wages have increased , driving up the cost of production and dramatically effecting Pakistan 's competitiveness . #% I fear that in the supposed interests of efficiency we are surrendering something much more valuable - the very democracy at the heart of all our nations - to the centralised technocracy which is the Commission . #% If there are any points in that report which she disagrees with , her group can vote against them there and then and that will resolve the issue . #% Sometimes the increases are substantial , as in the case of research and development . #% I suggest therefore that we look to pool the experience we have in the different Member States in order to establish good practices in this field within the sphere of competence to which I have referred . #% It is not much to ask but it would affect the lives of disabled people and mean that they could be included in the electronics communications revolution instead of being excluded . #% Could it simply be that they make wine that suits the customer 's palate ? #% Indeed , I urge them not only not to retreat from that position but actually to seek wider agreement on the need , certainly in principle , for future measures which would in particular bring about an emission standstill in the next century and , possibly , take the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth 's atmosphere from an emission standstill of 550 parts per million down to perhaps as low as 350 parts per million . #% This uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far . #% I think it is right for the debate on the future of Europe to be prolonged . #% Ever since it began legislating in this area , it has confused the issue , making enforcement progressively more difficult . #% We have acknowledged the fundamental link between good health and the reduction in poverty and we now need to enhance this priority in our development policies . #% That is , unfortunately , the unavoidable nature of the beast . #% Only those parliaments can hold ministers to account . #% Does the Council consider that much greater investment in and economic support and assistance for these countries bordering the new external frontiers of the European Union -- and in the Balkans -- will be essential when we have enlarged the European Union ? #% He brings something to us which will hopefully provide some interesting issues to be debated and discussed and then resolved in consultation . #% This gives us just such a platform to launch that process . #% The amendment for Category 4 should not be seen as Parliament just flexing its muscles . #% So far not one penny has arrived . #% Mr President , the importance of the package as a whole is clear , both for a major European industry and for its customers and users . #% I speak as my group 's representative on that parliamentary delegation and I know what I have seen . #% Under European arrest warrants , a suspected murderer was brought back from Latvia in four weeks and a suspected terrorist back from Italy in six weeks . #% The clear-up rate for general crime in Bulgaria bears comparison with that in many current EU Member States . #% But that has not meant that every police officer in every Member State inspecting those licences fully understands what is communicated or written on them . #% A young British student expressed them to me when he said : ` We have all heard of the three ` Es ' - education , education , education . #% Unfortunately this debate started late and Terry Wynn had to leave . #% I call on Parliament to support our amendments to reduce the initial step height to 24 cm or to ensure a boarding aid . #% We must act and act swiftly or else this House and all its institutions will always be held in low regard . #% As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control , I was perfectly entitled to see those reports without being subjected to a ridiculous Stalinist rigmarole . #% Suddenly , every five years , the European electorate has to go out and vote not for a government , not to change or keep a government , but for a parliament in isolation . #% I am concerned that we are going to be protective of the European shoe industry . #% On that basis I will vote for the amended Ries report . #% It is very important that the forms of cooperation we have continue beyond the meetings with our parliamentary colleagues so that we can support their efforts , as elected representatives , to conduct dialogue with their governments , to scrutinise the legislation and actions of their governments and to hold their governments to account . #% I want today to urge President Musharraf to ensure that these forthcoming elections not only take place but that they do so in an environment that will be conducive to ensuring that a clean bill of health can be given to them by any international observer mission , whether it is one sent by the European Union or anyone else . #% Mr President , I have to return again to the difficulties which Members experienced in getting here to Strasbourg for this plenary session . #% Surely this not only breaches countless principles of the European Union , but also competition policy rules as well . #% Therefore , one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of Pakistan , who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent , accountable rule , and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence . #% This report highlights the many failings of a number of authorities and yet comes forward with some positive ideas on how we can avoid a repeat of the Prestige disaster . #% For the United Kingdom , the content of the proposal has been met with disbelief by the industry . #% He demonstrated a supreme sense of patriotism and duty to his estranged country , and went as far as to say that he would serve Afghanistan in any capacity his people chose through their assembled tribal council , or Loya Jirga , which he has been working on for the last two years . #% However , I was extremely disappointed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs changed its mind after first reading ; my amendments , which were not accepted , would have halved the exposure limit value . #% Whatever it is , we hope she brings it forward in concrete form and soon . #% Yesterday , the ministers of the 15 imposed sanctions on Burma , and there has been a siege of the elected leader of Burma , Aung San Suu Kyi , and an outburst of violence around her home . #% Also , the final settlement of the East Jerusalem question , as well as the right of return questions , will be almost impossible with Hamas in government for the Palestinian Authority . #% It is only by joint across-the-board action that we can tackle this issue , not least by agreeing to extra-territorial application of criminal laws . #% Mr President , let me start by saying clearly that this debate tonight is about one of the great failures of EU development policy . #% That , in some countries , is the only way to effect change . #% The British public ( ... ) will not accept taxes imposed by the EU and nor would the citizens of the other ( ... ) countries , if they but realised what was going on ( ... ) . #% Indeed , the Hamas people we met were not very loveable . #% Mr President , I had the honour of representing the European Parliament on the management committee of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and one of my colleagues there was Professor Doctor Anton Pelinka , representing the Austrian government . #% This is the first part-session since then , the first chance for all of us to judge the UK Presidency on whether it means what it says . #% Multinational companies , international companies and - hopefully one day - European companies will require harmonized audit rules to be in place . #% I was the rapporteur for the last round , and we are currently working on a new single market report . #% Now is our chance to prove that we are serious . #% The Single Market is a win-win game , not a zero-sum game . #% In fact , education itself is so important that Prime Minister Blair has said in the past that he only has three policies : education , education and education . #% If the euro is a weak currency , than the Mark was positively anaemic . #% 
Firstly , the ` mopping-up ' transfer , which the rapporteur has described quite eloquently . #% Nevertheless , the absence in Chisinau of a European Commission delegation and the fact that Italy , unlike Britain , France and Germany , does not have an embassy in Moldova - in spite of links with the Romanian-speaking peoples - is regrettable . #% Mr President , it was just announced that tomorrow we will vote urgently on financial aid for Serbia and Montenegro . #% I believe , on the evidence of the hearings , that we are up to this task and I look forward with pleasure to the European Parliament working with Mr Duisenberg 's team for Europe 's common and exciting future . #% Community policy on equal treatment for women and men does not contain a specific component for single parents but it has a crucial impact on their situation , especially with regard to the reconciliation of work and family life , a challenge central to the whole range of social issues . #% Therefore we need the third-pillar measure . #% The adoption of this text is going to strengthen the hand of the European Union in arguing for an end to the unfair , anti-competitive scam in the United States of requiring non-US companies to pay collateral within the United States , where they are regulated state by state . #% This does not detract from an important piece of political work , and the European Parliament can be proud of the contribution we are making today to support peace , justice and security for Israel and the Palestine . #% We still need it and I hope the Commission will heed the call for it made in the report . #% How , Secretary-General , are we going to handle this if we do not have some thinking from the Administration as to where we are going to put them all ? #% The resentment in that country is not just against France . #% Your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country . #% It was at their request that it was postponed in the first place . #% If we agree to the Miranda report - and I am arguing in favour of agreeing as well as not postponing - that will set up the very framework in which human rights issues can be mentioned . #% We must all remember that providing a railway is not just about profit -- it is also about safety -- but it is also about service and service levels to the people that are supposed to be transported from one place to another . #% I especially dislike the fact that the EU is hoovering up fishing rights on the cheap for rich and mainly Spanish fishing fleets to abuse , and thus I voted against this particular report . #% Member States need to be encouraged to negotiate targets in line with their own particular circumstances and the environmental performance of fuels suitable to their geographical areas . #% It is internally consistent and incorporates some 20 first reading amendments from Parliament , including several that I submitted , such as the need to cater for the electronic age and Internet age by allowing for computer and disk storage of data , exemptions for telephone selling , exemptions for the travel industry for small contracts and action to ensure that the scope of the directive does not extend to the mere provision of information on products . #% In debate yesterday , and in written statements and letters to me , suitable assurances have been given and these will all be published . #% It will not just be a tool whereby we can learn lessons from disasters and apply them in the future . #% So the health monitoring programme that I mentioned previously is seeking to collect all that data and have it more readily available so that we can get a better understanding of how to deal with the matter . #% She has not been elected , and the people do not have the power to remove her . #% It is , as a British Foreign Secretary , Ernest Bevin , used to say , the main purpose of a foreign policy to allow citizens to be able to travel with a minimum of bureaucratic interference and annoyance . #% We must improve this situation . #% As is the case with all other existing Community agencies , the Commission proposes that Member States be represented on the governing board so that their presence ensures full coordination of the European Union ' s activities with those carried out in the field by Member States . #% In particular , I want to highlight the damage being done to the British rail freight industry by the policy of the French authorities effectively to close the tunnel to freight trains for 18 hours a day . #% True equality is having the right to choose and not be judged for these choices . #% As we have now started the debate we can not do that , but I would just like to express my concern that I was not called before the debate started . #% The original proposal from the Commission could have devastated Europe 's small-business stock markets such as Aim markets . #% With those reservations , much as I support enlargement , we must be careful how we do it . #% We can do so much by example that it is important for this House to maintain these links . #% Finally , there will be more heat than light from some speakers today and I am afraid I might include Mr Helmer of whose remarks I had a foretaste last night on the way back from the delightful asparagus dinner . #% Firstly , we need clear and commonly agreed principles governing the trade . #% What I have repeatedly witnessed , however , is the appalling conditions in which some bodies have been received because of the lack of proper embalming or care treatment in some countries . #% I would hate to think that these amendments were being tabled just as a political ploy or for a press release , because they call for the citizens of the Quartier Leopold to be able to use the facilities within the Parliament such as the shops . #% Although the Commission will deploy the money as fast as is necessary , Parliament retains control as one half of the budgetary authority . #% I think what you said is somewhat encouraging in that it signals some strengthening in the oversight and mechanisms that the Commission will have for the future , but the fact is that there is the past . #% By the way , the four witnesses must be Muslims , not non-Muslims . #% Secondly , while those whose physical assets were destroyed received compensation , those whose livelihoods were damaged to a similar extent by administrative measures introduced to fight the disease received nothing . #% I know there are a lot of discussions going on about the pension system at the moment and the Commissioner may , indeed , refer to that later . #% In several places , paragraphs 11 , 13 and so on , the report emphasises the importance of maintaining services of public and general interest and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity . #% That is the message that needs to go out . #% As we are aware , the Council meeting in Cologne fully endorsed the need to include minimum core labour standards in the negotiations for the WTO millennium round . #% Those are marvellous points and together with the protection from ` cold calling ' by telephone , an amendment which I have been concerned with before , they add up to a real degree of protection . #% Even Members of the Petitions Committee , behind closed doors , are not allowed to have any legal advisers , or political advisers , and are not allowed to take copies . #% Some speakers here have dwelt , quite understandably , on the problems that would arise from the fact that Iceland and Norway , through not being Member States of the European Union , will be excluded from discussions on the future development of the free movement area if it were to be incorporated into the Union treaties . #% In contemporary society and with more mobility we really ought to be contemplating a simpler , less bureaucratic system . #% So it is extremely important that this second report , which we must now focus upon , looks at the necessary root-and-branch reform . #% I realise that there is little to be done at this stage , but unfortunately feel my position will be vindicated by future events . #% I understand the havoc it wreaked for so many individuals and communities in North Yorkshire and elsewhere . #% Would not such an initiative be desirable in developing countries and countries in transition , as well as within the European Union ? #% It was the people of Northern Cyprus who voted in favour of the Annan Plan ; it is the Government of Northern Cyprus that has expressed its readiness to reopen negotiations on the basis of the UN Secretary-General 's plan . #% It is a great fallacy to assume that if you give asylum seekers less help in making their claims , they will somehow disappear and cost less time and money . #% We all hope that he will . #% We need more co-operation with the Russian authorities and the independent media to report the truth to the outside world . #% I am proud to stand here and defend a woman 's right to choose . #% Commissioner Nielson will be aware that on 15 July his services promised a firm proposal on this point and that I received his reply by fax only at 3.40 p.m. this afternoon after this debate had begun . #% Of course , only the risk is underwritten . #% I was half expecting to see him put in an appearance this week , or possibly even to vote . #% It was rather enthusiastic , but vague in terms of the impact of certain actions . #% Codes of conduct to mitigate harmful cross-border competitive taxation should also be applied . #% I cite the package travel directive as one example . #% I start from the premise of why do we want a single currency . #% This report , and the Commission proposal that lies behind it , certainly echo this call . #% Britain and Spain are still trying to resolve the question of Gibraltar that has gone on for three centuries . #% In 1994 , the Green Group was the first group in this Parliament to have a majority of women in it , the Greens were the first group to have a woman secretary-general in Dominique Voinet , now the French Environment Minister , and the German Greens were the first political party to operate gender parity in order to redress the overall under-representation of women in political institutions . #%

I fully support the condemnation of Iran in the resolution for its brutal human rights track record , including the execution of minors for sexual chastity offences . #% As it is , I can only leave colleagues to make their own judgements as to the efforts made . #% I would like to thank my colleague Dr Langen for all the hard work that he has put in on this issue and I think I can say on behalf of the Socialist Group that there has been a genuine bipartisan approach to this subject . #% Up until now we have had very few proposals in this area and therefore I particularly welcome this one . #% I welcome this proposal but I am not sure whether the timing is particularly good , coming as it does from the Commission before we can fully assess the impact of enlargement . #% For example , in the United Kingdom , because of animal welfare legislation , the British pig farmer is suffering . #% I want to be able to go back to my constituents and tell them that I am an efficient representative . #% I was privileged to be part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy to Afghanistan in June 2003 . #% There is no such thing as fair competition in the single market , while Member States refuse to comply properly with our rules and regulations . #% Much nonsense is talked about who armed Saddam . #% We have to acknowledge that in this House we regularly call upon other countries and governments to recognise the rights of ethnic minorities and to practice policies of universal human rights . #% On the other hand , in America crops which have been genetically modified are increasing and the proportion of maize now grown under GM conditions is quite large . #% Yet fighting is still going on in several provinces , especially in rural Bujumbura . #% But we must make them understand that either we help the communities in the Caribbean through special trading links with the European Union , or else we hand those Caribbean nations over to drug traffickers and people involved in organised crime . #% I would like to see Parliament , the Commission and the Council take an initiative early in the new year to press for reform of the Bretton Woods institutions . #% Mr President , very seldom in the history of this Parliament has there been such a high level of interest in our legislative work . #% We should not seek to stop those changes . #% The voters are starting to notice . #% Second , those who want EU funding for all the Natura 2000 sites have to guard against overbidding . #% I hope that , in the aftermath of this Spring Summit , we are going to pay attention to the policies that we talked about there . #% It is clear to me that a retrial is a breach of the double jeopardy interdiction of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and also the spirit of Article 2 of the EU-Egypt Euro-Mediterranean Agreement on respect for human rights . #% We hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seriousness of the concerns being expressed . #% I want to commend him for this initiative and for many others . #% Firstly , as we noted in the annual policy strategy ( APS ) discussions in May , which form the basis for our preparation for this budget , the speed of globalisation outside Europe is shaping our policies . #% Capitalism , for all its faults , works . #% But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue . #% It was then a country with huge energy shortages , tremendous dislocation , Soviet troops still on its soil and tremendous insecurity . #% We see not only significant benefits in a larger single market , but we also look - unlike some Members of this House - for a dilution of the federalist ambition at the heart of the European Union . #% It is clearly a key issue for copyright and trademark holders . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to start by saying how relieved I am that , at long last , we finally have before us a proposal for legislation to tackle the problem of illegal logging . #% Expel us ! #% As well as protecting the wellbeing of those suffering from dementia , it is important to raise awareness of carers , who often have to deal with emotional and financial difficulties ; the development of action plans to improve the day-to-day situation for carers is another step towards improving the lives of those affected by Alzheimer 's and dementia . #% Some have used the word secrecy . #% That shows the importance today of stopping up the areas where terrorists operate and finance themselves . #% Member States need to increase their ramp inspections to weed out those airlines which are based in one country but register in another and have lower standards than we would expect within the European Union . #% No change there then . #% in writing . - I will be voting for the report by Mr Trakatellis . #% The fact is , of course , that we are already more than half way through the preparatory period for these negotiations on EPAs , so these delays are rather difficult for the ACP to deal with ; they are delays that affect thousands of livelihoods in the ACP and so there is deep concern . #% I would like clarity on that point . #% That was my original intention . #% Europe is its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will wager that when we ask the question - ` What is Europe ? ' - we answer it by saying , ` It is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage . ' #% I am glad to have been able to work with many colleagues and to make a contribution . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I listened with interest to what the Members said . #% That is the reason we voted against this report . #% We certainly would not wish to see the European Court of Justice involved in this area . #% One or two of our members said to you that reforms in relation to the flow of information , proper internal audits and Commissioners ' responsibility for the services they run should have been completed by September 1999 . #% I appreciate the honourable Member 's good wishes to the Commissioner . #% Such an open society has to be fair and just and not a free ride for the criminals and the terrorists . #% Finally , what the report does say is that consultation has taken place with the social partners . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I did not think I was going to get to make this speech , I thought I would have to send it to you later , but I very much wanted to participate on behalf of my group . #% Are you to be tainted by association with them , or will you be expressing your concerns and the pressing need for change ? #% My group very much welcomes the proposal from the ILO for the Convention and the recommendation on domestic workers . #% Indeed , Egypt co-chairs the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and , with Egypt , we have defined a European Neighbourhood Policy , which strengthens political dialogue and integrates us with Egypt -- as Egypt is within the Arab League -- to promote peace and stability . #% Many of us would want the Union to enjoy more direct interaction with regional and local authorities , because they are frequently more sensible intermediaries between the citizen and the Union than the more remote and centralised national governments . #% Let us face the other fact : if people do not join up to the European Statute , will they not be at a competitive disadvantage at some time in the future ? #% One key element of that programme will be the work you will do to set out clearly the social goals we need to achieve in the reform of our pension systems . #% It has brought forward a proposal which is very good , not quite perfect - but nothing ever is - and is taking a proposal from this Parliament seriously and acting on it . #% In just a few weeks five new women a day came forward for counselling . #% The new charging policies for social care services effectively stop them from benefiting from those essential services . #% I accept - Mr Santer pressed for this yesterday - that this is a decision of principle and I recognise that it depends upon British action in their programme of eradication of the disease , in an endeavour to restore confidence among beef-eating consumers . #% If what he says is correct , surely such a body would vindicate his position , clear the air and reject these ongoing allegations of funding of terrorist activities by the PLO , but also , perhaps more insidiously , the funding of race hatred and the brainwashing of young Palestinians in their schools , which furthers long-term animosity and potentially creates future suicide bombers ? #% I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue . #% Thirdly , this early retirement proposal has a neutral budgetary impact . #% We reminded ourselves , and we do so again , that on 1 July the sixth amendment came into force . #% Madam President , very briefly , on a much sadder subject . #% Nevertheless , despite some reserves the Parliamentary delegation in the Convention will follow the principal lines of this proposal and I look forward to future close collaboration inside the Convention with Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino . #% 
Well it will not be well . #% I believe that this is a sensible and rational course of action ; the House may have new powers but we must exercise them in a measured and responsible way . #% As has been mentioned this evening , e-commerce and online business are developing very rapidly and it is very important that we put in place a legislative framework in Europe within which it can develop and flourish . #% The longer it is delayed the more the earlier directives on part-time and fixed-term working will be undermined , as temporary agency working becomes the favoured choice for employers for whom the word ` flexibility ' means squeezing the maximum out of labour for the least possible reward . #% It is slightly odd that we have had this debate without the full participation of the representatives of the central and eastern countries , when we realise there are huge problems and challenges concerning the absorption of those countries , as regards not only institutional operation but also policy making . #% If we are simply going to read speeches to each other , we might as well exchange our views by post . #% It would seem that the only way we can do so is by using the flexibility instrument . #% The EU should respond to UN requests through use of its political , humanitarian , electoral observation and development assistance tools . #% We must also ensure that health and safety costs , consumer protection costs and abattoir control charges do not escalate to the point where they can not be afforded . #% Is it then the case that because you are not prepared to have it as an agenda item , that again confirms the perception that you are not willing to consider development as an integral part of these negotiations because you see it as giving the ACP more leverage in the negotiations as they go on . #% Madam President , I will continue with this back-scratching exercise that is going on . #% We must never see the funeral pyres which remain so vivid in the memories of all who witnessed them both in person and on our TV screens . #% There is of course another approach , and that is not to just look at the fuel , as in cars , but to use abatement technology , so called ` sea-water scrubbers ' , and I am pleased that the compromise includes provision for trials of this new technology . #% I hope we will eventually find a just solution involving the Kashmiri people that will end human rights abuses from all sides . #% Governments have to decide if they really want to catch the traffickers , or if they only want headlines about how many illegal immigrants they have deported . #% Mr President , the proposal to refer this back to committee is totally inappropriate , particularly for the reasons given . #% It will fall to pieces ; of that there can be no doubt , as surely as it did for Britain during the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 . #% It does not matter about blood banks or plasma banks in Europe - we can not take them from countries in the EU where there has been BSE or new variant CJD so we have to look elsewhere , and we and others rely largely on the United States ' supplies . #% What is wanted is more research . #% We had a ten-minute statement from the Presidency which answered none of the seven questions . #% Secondly , as the Socialist Group has always demanded , we have managed to keep the Contact Group together and , indeed , have now got Russia actively engaged in pursuing peace . #% We had the case of Leah Betts , a young girl who died taking ecstasy , an amphetamine . #% That is maybe cynical if truthful . #% The 12 % rise in the share value of Michelin in the days following the announcement shows what a cynical and deliberate manipulation of the stock market was involved here . #% Despite all this agreement and it being so late in the evening , we are all of the opinion that it is essential to have a debate on this important report . #% Many Members here are being invited , as I am , to conferences , some organized by presidents-in-office , full of experienced rational experts who want a European contribution to international problems which can not be properly tackled at local or national levels . #% Therefore stabilising this region in peace , democracy , good governance with the rule of law and respect for human rights is essential to the EU 's interest , as well as the people there who have suffered under tyrannical governments for so long . #% I was wondering whether you have had any reply to that letter . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , the continued consolidation of democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey , which should lead to full membership of our European Union , becomes even more important as Arab and Middle Eastern countries just beyond Europe 's borders stand in crisis . #% This is also the case with the European Union . #% I should like to thank Mr Bangemann for what he said and in particular I would like to thank him on behalf of the small and medium-sized enterprises in my constituency which will look very favourably upon this particular proposal for change . #% We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively . #% The legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in Zimbabwe today . #% Despite the fact that the EPLP still have certain reservations concerning the Kreissl-Dörfler report , British Labour MEPs voted to support the report in the final vote . #% I want to thank him for all his work over those 15 years , and also wish him well for his new post . #% The rare diseases programme is aimed by definition at smaller groups , even at family level , often faced by vast bureaucracies for whom those sorts of expenditures constitute little more than a heavy lunch . #% Parliament has become now an assured player in the constitutive process and we have assisted Europe to answer definitively the old question about whether the Union could widen and deepen at the same time . #% I know that there are several child pornographers who have set up business in one EU country because if they are caught they know they will get a lesser sentence in that country . #% I read at the weekend -- and I hope the President-in-Office will react to it -- that the British Treasury has not budgeted one cent for a reduction in the budget rebate , meaning that British taxpayers could end up paying higher taxes . #% Two of my constituents interrupted their holiday to come and see me last week in the European Parliament because they were concerned that what we would vote through would jeopardise long-held pension plans that they had made in the last 10 years or so . #% I hope , via split votes , that we can leave that text out of the finished text at second reading . #% I very much welcome what the Commissioner has said , and the report , and look forward to this being followed up with very strong action . #% When fully implemented it will bring about a transformation in the culture of recycling in many Member States . #% She has drawn attention to the employment consequences of mergers and other changes , and she has rightly drawn attention to the problems of exporting into poorer countries drugs which are not allowed to go on sale within the European Union . #% This Plan Colombia is a plan for war not a plan for peace and tonight Europe rejects it completely . #% It had , from the point of view of the visitor , whether a journalist or a tourist , three great advantages : the charm of the Lebanese people , the fact that the electricity and water had been put in by the British and that the cuisine had been installed largely by the French . #% Month after month we have heard Members of this European Parliament demanding ever tougher action in Kosovo , and yet we discover in the General Affairs Council that the countries these Members represent are the countries which are not prepared to take action on Kosovo . #% To this effect , the EPLP can support the measures introduced to enable the right of call-back and sunset clauses contained within this directive , which is not an imposition on national powers . #% I think that would be extremely welcome and I say that as a delegate who has attended the three previous sessions . #% We must put safety first and ensure that as much as possible is done to protect our citizens whilst travelling abroad . #% Will it therefore not be necessary to re-examine the whole constitutional package ? #% The next hurdle , of course , will be getting a new agreement on SWIFT through this House , but also one on passenger name records ( PNR ) , which , in my view , will prove no less controversial . #% It is a religious fundamentalist , barbaric , pro-terrorist and anti-Semitic regime . #% So I welcome the ban . #% The other thing I would say is that there will be a huge bottleneck at the beginning of year 2000 , making it difficult to get these programmes approved . #% Mr Erwin asked Europe to see sense , to avoid re-opening the package , and once again to talk about trade , development and cooperation . #% Mr President , I can not support the Perry report . #% So , given these figures , it is a real shame that so much emphasis was placed on agriculture in the DOHA development round when it is really the opening of trade and services that promises to take so many people out of poverty . #% I am grateful for the off-the-cuff response she has given me today : it is voluminous and helpful . #% I congratulate Simon Murphy on this report and the amendments which he has tabled . #% However , I do have a right to the long view and to second opinions , and where there are concerns , even if these have been allayed to some degree in the period when a new product is coming into use , as is certainly the case with salt of aspartame , nevertheless it is right to think after these products have gone into use - and they are now being used in many hundreds of different confectionery and other products - that over time a periodic review of a new substance is necessary . #% Today I see that the Commission has again called for the release of prisoners who are currently being held and I support that call . #% Some people have queried one or two other amendments , notably the original paragraph 15 , which was an amendment put to the committee by Mrs Thyssen . #% Can we look very briefly at the wording of Mr Blak 's report ? #% Mr Wolfowitz has been hounded out of office by those opposed to his anti-corruption agenda . #% Firstly , we have the common fisheries policy , with its seriously damaging quota system . #% 
It is quite condescending to presume or to suggest that the ACP could not manage that relationship under the budgets . #% If we want to kick-start the global economy after the crisis of the last 12 months , international trade plays an extremely important role . #% Some NGOs , including Amnesty International , had to disassociate themselves from it . #% We live in an imperfect world and the use of thresholds reflects that reality . #% We are talking about big business here . #% If afflicts many European countries . #% In terms of Cyprus , I would like a clear statement that neither the Commission nor the Council intends to set a date for the opening of negotiations . #% However , if this regulation were to result in the closure of a major industry in that area , the results would be counter-productive and would exacerbate the social and economic problems . #% I hope that day never comes and I will do my utmost to prevent it . #% I would urge you to do so . #% The problem we have is that when the Court of Auditors reports every year and can not give a positive statement of assurance , it is because of problems within the Member States . #% We have seen during the last week the response by labour , by workers , by trade unions in Germany to the proposed cuts in public services and cuts in public benefits as a consequence of the German Government 's determination to meet the Maastricht criteria for EMU . #% They produce hardly any goods that anyone wants to buy apart from military equipment . #% The goals pursued by public authorities are justifiably , in the public interest , a mixture that includes environmental and social goals . #% Mr President , I rise in relation to the Seventh Framework Research Programme currently being considered by the institutions . #% It goes back to an era before not only the Internet but even before the commercially available personal computer . #% Politicians always tend to want to change directives and demonstrate their power . #% Species like sprat , Norwegian pout and sand eel may not be used for human consumption but if huge numbers are scooped up for use as fish meal to feed pigs and chickens or as fish oil to make margarine and cooking oils and to feed farmed fish , the delicate eco-balance is distorted and food sources for fish like herring and cod , etc. which are eaten by humans are depleted . #% The vote on the calendar followed a formal sitting last time . #% Legitimate and lasting partnerships should never be put under threat . #% It also sends an unfortunate message to the outside world . #% In fact , all the migratory birds in the United Kingdom come from the north , not from an area where avian flu is present . #% Further to that , I wish to say that I am sure the President-in-Office will be aware that there has been a lot of concern expressed about some of the suggestions - admittedly no more than suggestions - within this draft paper , to the effect that we should modify in a major way the existing Geneva Convention and possibly remove the individual right to seek asylum . #% Did our Council of Ministers not call for a cessation of hostilities rather than a ceasefire ? #% It is deeply unimpressive and needs to be looked at immediately . #% It is time now for governments to listen to what this Parliament has to say 100 % of the time and for those governments to act . #% Research carried out by organisations such as the Consumers ' Association has highlighted the kinds of tactics adopted by some of these big-name companies . #% We have failed to send an immediate response when it was most obviously required , and this proposal is part of Commissioner Patten 's praiseworthy efforts to improve the Union 's aid programme , which is in a bit of a mess , to say the least . #% It has been a positive achievement , not just for the people of the United Kingdom , and not just for the people of the European Union , but also for the European Parliament . #% This will inevitably lead to the unfair exclusion of many important sites . #% After all , these countries complete the previous round of enlargement , the EU 's fifth round , and are not part of the next . #% I thank all the colleagues and the Commission for their hard work and their kind words . #% We were told that we would vote at 12 noon . #% I am delighted that the Committee on Fisheries has accepted a large number of the Liberal Group 's amendments : increasing the powers of the EU inspectors , which is essential for fair play across the board ; similar penalties for similar offences across the Union to ensure legal equity in a common policy such as fishing ; much greater enforcement in the transport and marketing areas of the supply chain , which this report showed was almost totally lacking . #% I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House . #% We have seen in the recent case in the United Kingdom that the enormous number of birds now imported into the European Union -- some legally , some illegally -- is a potent source of further infection . #% I am not so sure it has , and if he sees the Consumers ' Association survey of the conditions in which chicken is being packaged and sold , he will see that there is room for doubt and concern even here . #% Secondly , the polling stations had transparent plastic , sealed ballot boxes , which were watched by official observers , as they filled up throughout the day , and were counted on the spot . #% For me that confirms that the Praesidium has actually been working as a kind of pre-IGC . #% I hope the Commission might now look at the possibility of helping in that exchange of information , especially if the research has been funded by the EU , in fields such as age-related macular degeneration , for instance , which is the main cause of loss of sight in the elderly in the EU . #% We booked her a hotel room with disabled people 's access . #% Such bans are misguided . #% We are winning the argument to have a wider agenda . #% Let us make sure that the coastal authorities are aware of the presence of vessels carrying hazardous material . #% We now have a comprehensive blueprint for the way in which cultural policy could operate in the Union . #% So it has bitten the bullet , it is a serious response , and one which I commend . #% This is a club , as you heard from the group leaders earlier , that is treating the voters of France and the Netherlands with absolute contempt as it tries to impose the provisions of a Constitution that should be dead . #% But if we look back to the isoglucose case , it says that no legislation can pass unless Parliament has given its opinion . #% We have crucial decisions to make in the Union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years . #% I congratulate the rapporteur on highlighting such a very important issue and also highlighting the failures of the Commission to get to grips with it thus far . #% However , we are not in that position . #% Therefore , I would like to make it clear that these statements are entirely untrue . #% For God 's sake , let us all admit it . #% It is in any case high time that the levels in the annexes were reviewed , because they do not take account of changes in diet and cultural preferences . #% There are , however , various practical points and issues regarding sovereignty which the UK takes very seriously and which means it is not appropriate or possible for the United Kingdom to be included at this time . #% Hopefully , thanks to the tighter definitions of the information required and the proposal for a delay for full consultation in the light of proposed large-scale redundancies and other potentially harmful changes , we shall avoid the situation where we see workers appealing to this Parliament to protect their rights and interests . #% We can agree on 70 new posts to be created in Dublin as a temporary measure and 35 posts are to remain in Brussels until the vets and phytosanitary agency are properly set up . #% The examples are from my own constituency , but resonate across the whole of the EU . #% There is also an urgent need to make sure that small and vulnerable states - landlocked states - are protected in future deals that are made . #% Sadly , the Beslan attack will not be the last . #% My mother-in-law died of breast cancer and my wife 's eldest sister was diagnosed with breast cancer ten years ago , but thanks to early and successful treatment she is alive and well today . #% It was the first of the post-communist governments to see out its full term . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , may I start by praising the hard efforts of Commissioner Michel Barnier ? #% This looks hypocritical since the Council agreed a very restrictive text on family reunion rights . #% When we see and look at work in other committees it is not entirely clear that colleagues bear simplification in mind . #% Dr Shipman could have come to a surgery near you . #% 
in writing . - This report proposes various measures , some of which might be of assistance to small businesses , but whose overall effect is to promote EU control , churning of the population , feminist agendas and infiltration of businesses by EU officials ` on work-experience ' . #% Twenty-one people have died of the new variant of CJD , the human form of BSE , in Britain since 1995 . #% We should support you and the work that you are doing , and make sure that we recognise that `` voluntary nature '' is writ large in everything we do from here on . #% I suspect that they also present the Commission with certain difficulties , if not only because of the tensions which naturally exist between DG Development 's concerns and priorities and DG Trade 's concerns and priorities , which are very different . #% I welcome the references in the report to the role of Combined Joint Task Forces , the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council , the Partnership for Peace programme and the importance of establishing a European armaments agency . #% That is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report . #% This is a pity . #% Some diseases are neglected because they are rare in western countries , so no market has emerged to develop such drugs . #% We disagreed with the Commission , however , on the point of protection being afforded by a state-like agency , such as the UNHCR , and felt that this effectively imposed the duties of a state on a body that could not be held legally accountable . #% Mr President , you were quite right to point out that it only affects some languages . #% I am thinking of one very worthy project within my own constituency which , because of the very short timetable and a misunderstanding , did not enable contracts to be drawn up by the end of December last year . #% Undoubtedly , the attempt to impose Han Chinese majority culture on tiny minorities in the world 's most populous country is causing much tension and resentment . #% He found , after just a brief examination of the temporary structure above the north stand in Charleroi , that there were too many seats in the rows , the stand is too steep , the safety barriers are too low , the exits from the stand are too narrow and the stairways at the back of the stand are too wide . #% There is enormous mass action going on , there has been tear-gassing of people , at least one person has been killed . #% Month after month , I have warned that you can not go on buying up vast quantities of your own bad debt . #% At the precarious times we are facing now - which we have heard already in this Parliament - it is important that we discuss these matters as fully as we can . #% Secondly , the value of a timetable . #% On the main report , the political group which I represent as coordinator supports it throughout - to such an extent that we wanted it to be kept , like Mrs Dührkop 's , as short as possible . #% If that is so , then let me tell them that they should think again . #% So we have reservations about the accuracy of the report but we welcome it and have voted in favour . #% We have actually achieved that in this case . #% We can not , in terms of EU-Russia relations , simply pretend that this did not happen . #% We welcome the fact that ASEAN started to get involved in this process at its ministerial meeting in June . #% I know that you all hate President Klaus because he believes in national democracy . #% We need to close ranks to ensure that whatever new regime is put in place for sanctions is not breached by those seeking commercial or political advantage . #% The insensitive imposition of harmonization has caused untold political damage to the European political enterprise and had the single market been based more on mutual recognition and less on harmonization Europe 's political condition would be much less febrile than it is today . #% Bombing has not stopped the killing , but increased it . #% We can only eradicate Third World poverty by empowering businesses , particularly those engaged in fair trade , to provide the decent work so desperately needed . #% Quite frankly , this is unacceptable . #% The committee has made positive amendments to the Commission 's already sound proposals and I trust this position will be maintained in the vote tomorrow and supported by the Council . #% Nobody argues with the fact that hexavalent chromium causes dermatitis but , of course , we must not forget that only 50 % of dermatitis cases are linked to this particular cause . #% I offer as an example our Objective 3 partnership 's development of a tool kit for gender mainstreaming in structural funding . #% The situation is more akin to a black hole in space , sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes . #% We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety . #% Mr Santer came to us with a package of confidence-creating measures which at the moment seems to many like a confidence trick . #% We have concerns over the workings of a European Public Prosecutor 's office whilst being concerned to protect the Union 's interests and resources against fraud throughout Community territory . #% He did not , but he got a war that he could blame on the Israelis anyway . #% It has been there for a long time . #% It all seems ridiculous . #% The fact that it is taking place today shows the concern from all political groups and all nations in this Parliament at the way in which our deregulated Sunday has affected the life of many ordinary people . #% Mr President , the main points of controversy in this report concern three different types of contractual agreement , namely repo agreements , netting agreements , and contracts conducted on a regulated market . #% Action needs to be carefully considered and based on good science . #% In the free market their global reach gives them unprecedented options . #% No-one should play silly games with health and safety and I should say , without fear of reproach , that this report is one of the most important directives made in health and safety . #% This will essentially be brought into play as the single homologation approval framework for buses across the European Union . #% Firstly , the safety argument that we have already heard about . #% However , there is a big problem : those older people will be the people with outdated skills . #% Mr Blair 's real problem is that he can not say any of that . #% It is made quite clear in this report that , at the same time as we should not be imposing liberalisation on other countries , we should also not be imposing protectionism on other countries , or state monopolies . #% Can the Commission state absolutely certainly that it is going to be possible to apply this maximum 1 % content level to very small quantities of ingredients ? #% We also have to prove our credentials for Arctic involvement , and our record as Europeans is not good . #% Today is Human Rights Day and yet there are 12 European citizens in prison in Greece without trial . #% Over 2 000 disappeared and were never seen again . #% When man seeks to play God , nature has an uncomfortable habit of reasserting itself . #% The result of the committee vote was that we should maintain the immunity , but perhaps , we should bear in mind the type of litigation here , where it appears that the plaintiff himself is trying to use the immunity of this House in a manner which may be questionable . #% In particular it opens up all manner of possibilities for remote rural areas , for ultra-peripheral islands and poorer less favoured regions with a low density of population and limited transport infrastructure . #% It is only when people have such knowledge that they can start to adapt their behaviour and choose energy-saving options . #% Virtually everybody agrees -- the Commission , the group leaders in Parliament -- that it is jolly good that two more countries are joining . #% The changes we need , require fundamental cooperation across Member States of a kind that education ministers , vice-chancellors of universities and national qualification agencies find enormously difficult . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Haarder and it is good to see him again in his new role . #% I warmly welcome Mrs Hermange 's report on a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities . #% Given those two factors I suspect that the report 's author is more guilty of wishful thinking than scientific fact . #% If we are serious about promoting a transfer of freight traffic from road to rail , with all of the environmental benefits that this can bring , then this too is a very important consideration . #% I do not want him just to produce a proposal based word for word on this text . #% We are talking about a very poor , a very damaged country . #% Therefore , I hope that the Governing Council will also note its Treaty obligations in the manner of its decision-taking by majority . #% 
Therefore , we need to adopt a timetable - maybe a differing timetable for each Member State - because of the level at which technology is being introduced , the level of universal service that they may have . #% Firstly , whilst we very much welcome the Commission 's commitment to the inclusion of core labour standards in the enhanced GSP and in its trade agreements - we have seen evidence of that already in the South Africa trade agreement and the Cotonou Agreement - we stress in paragraph 11 of this resolution that new emphasis must be placed on practical implementation . #% It then suffered 32 years of war during which its economy and its environment were ruined and its people dispersed . #% I am sorry about this , but I look forward to a situation where the blood test for rabies antibodies can be verified and approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee and the scope of the regulation can be extended to encompass ferrets at the earliest opportunity . #% Secondly , in view of what I said this morning , when will she be able to bring forward the Green Paper on food policies ? #% Although I doubt we can do anything more now - and I am sure you are strictly following the Rules - I think that we need to look at this practice again for the future . #% We need to think about ways in which we can bring these various strands together so that our citizens feel that their issues are being answered promptly and that they are being directed to the right recipient . #% Did the Member States get it right ? #% These are difficult issues and I sympathise with the Commission for the delays that have been forced on it in bringing forward this request for a legal base . #% The fact that such action has been taken , together with the quite substantial reinforcement of existing legislation on the composition of feed and the exclusion of any tissues that may be contaminated , should start to satisfy customers , should restore confidence amongst consumers , that beef is as safe from infection as many other foods we consume . #% Since the Labour government made GCSE languages non-compulsory , the number of students studying French and German this year alone was 14 % less than in the previous year . #% The Commission insists on this , and so does Parliament . #% I said that throughout last week , and I am disappointed that Mr Titley has refused to listen . #% Mr President , if human rights form the core of European values , this annual report on human rights represents one of the most important dates of the year within this European Parliament . #% Yet the Commission proposals on inspection in its original document have been really watered down , and Parliament has had to fight to get even what we have currently in Article 15 . #% Swaziland , for example , depends on these for up to 40 % of all government revenues . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to add my congratulations to those that have already been made to the rapporteur , who has done an excellent job in revising some of the more unrealistic parts of the proposal . #% What is the point of a Foreign Secretary if we have got an EU foreign secretary with his own diplomatic service ? #% Maybe we were spoiled last year during the French Presidency , which at least made some concessions , but this year it was back to normal . #% It is still the case , however , that many of those who are at the moment exporting these tainted products will continue to attempt to evade legal provisions and checks . #% They are obstructing UN efforts in order to repatriate these people to East Timor . #% It is my desire and trust that this strange , idiosyncratic British policy will prove to be as short-lived as possible . #% In the areas we have looked at , we have done so very much in consultation with other institutions , because it is important to understand that these regulations apply all across the European institutions . #% In our view , the WTO faces such a crisis of legitimacy in public opinion that reform must come before any further negotiations , and that is the position we have put forward in our joint resolution with the GUE Group . #% We are not content to remain as a chorus . #% We have reduced rolling resistance and included gear shift indicators in this proposal , which was not in the original proposal . #% I should like to start that ball rolling in relation to the amendment from the PPE-DE Group that I mentioned earlier . #% In other words , they saw us coming ! #% Given that it is a highly sensitive issue and Member States will certainly be looking at it closely , the sort of balance he has achieved is going to be very much the right one . #% In this context , I welcome the EU 's belated banning of the political wing of Hamas from fund-raising in its territory . #% With its commitments in Japan , Taiwan and south-east Asia , can the United States be anything other than wary of anyone complicit in rearming China ? #% None of them have even acknowledged any of my correspondence . #% Secondly , of course our citizens want protection against crime and terrorism , but there is a very poor level of democratic scrutiny in the area of police and judicial cooperation . #% We must ensure that there is transparency of the political process in the Far East . #% We have heard that a number of these problems are due partly to a lack of resources and a lack of expertise . #% We do not want to go into the next programme until we have completed evaluation of the existing one . #% To give just one example , the Ontario Green Energy Act would be illegal under CETA . #% What is our message to a country like that ? #% rapporteur . - Madam President , this package is , I hope , more a case of ` third time lucky ' than ` work in progress ' . #% As with most waste issues in my country , the United Kingdom 's record is pathetic . #% What happened , in your own country Mr President ? #% We have all enjoyed the discussions - sometimes very wide-ranging - we have had on it . #% They seek to cut compensation , but compensation surely recognises the level of inconvenience , not the level of the fare . #% Of course , we have had the voluntary export arrangements which will last until 1999 , again using competition policy or trade policy largely for industry policy . #% I do not believe that we can take this matter further without a proper consideration not just of the technical debate but also of the way in which monopolies are currently developing . #% Rights equal to those of EU citizens in areas such as employment , education and social protection will enhance their economic contribution . #% If we are navel-gazing and examining our working conditions and those of our staff this morning , it is not a question of comfort and convenience , but because we want to be efficient as elected representatives and in spending taxpayers ' money . #% At the moment we are talking very much about the H5 vaccine , but we have to be ready with other forms of vaccine should the disease mutate into another strain . #% It took ages in this particular case , and when I asked both institutions why , they both said that they had replied in the time that they were given and quite within the guidelines . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner one question . #% In addition , abrogation of unanimity on police and judicial cooperation is not appropriate for this report as it is a much wider issue and is part of the broader ` Passerelle ' argument . #% We have to be clear once again - and I am glad the President-in-Office made the point - that we are talking here about autonomy , and now extensive autonomy ; we are not talking about independence . #% The Land Acquisition Act is even now preventing the harvesting of the crops to feed the hungry . #% It seems to me an excellent idea that the European Union concludes these agreements , and I personally hope that they continue . #% I would request the Commission and Council to pledge that the convention will have four parties inside it , and that the IGC will use the work of the convention as the basis for the IGC . #% Recently , the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK unveiled the fact that EU regional funds are being used to prop up arms dealing companies in Eastern Europe , with some projects receiving funding amounting to millions of euro , although these are some of the richest companies . #% Is not 80 % of salary for five years enough to satisfy someone 's need for financial back-up and to make sure that they do not need the extra finance which a company like Telefónica is giving ? #% The whole system has fallen into contempt . #% I found I was working with a remarkable man , who 40 years before the draft Treaty was already making history when , as a political prisoner of Mussolini -- which he was for 17 years -- he co-authored the Ventotene Manifesto , which already in 1941 said that : ` If our struggle against fascism is successful and if we win this war , then it will all have been in vain if it simply leads to the re-establishment of the old system of totally sovereign nation states in shifting alliances . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their reports to which I shall make some brief references later . #% They do not refer back to the illegal Soviet occupation of Latvia , nor indeed to the Hitler-Stalin or Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact . #% I would say to Mr Roszkowski that his mention of paedophiles in the context of sexual orientation is deeply misplaced and disgraceful . #% I am referring to Zimbabwe . #% If we look at the reality of the ECB 's concerns over the last few years , we can see that there has not been a stable relationship between the money supply and the growth of nominal income . #% I endorse Mr Brok 's call for a more balanced approach but as requested I also want to take the opportunity briefly to touch on another area of crisis which is of increasing concern at the moment and where the European Union has the capacity to exert some influence . #% We are now asked though to rescind our regulation and to accept this new directive , which is quite clearly much watered-down , and to expect ICAO to agree on some new international standards as soon as possible . #% 
Perhaps I should add that the correspondence was to do with matters that were very much under debate during the last part-session . #% This is not contained in the regulation . #% Mr President , for Europe to respond to the needs of young people it has to be in touch with what those needs are . #% Paragraph 10 mistakenly considers `` home defence as a vital part of the European Union 's security strategy '' , whereas it is the preserve of national governments . #% But under these proposals , all services are open , except those specifically excluded at the outset . #% May I invite the Commissioner to take account as well of the remarks made by the chairman of the De Beers company itself , Mr Oppenheimer , in a recent address to the Harvard Business School alumni conference held in Cape Town . #% I , like many of my colleagues , wish the referendum process well and will support the outcome of the vote on the 24 April , whichever way it goes . #% in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues are supportive of a number of the general principles outlined in this report , including support for carers , work-life balance , and parental leave . #% A case must be allowed to be developed that can go to the Court of Human Rights , but this is also being denied as matters are being pushed through quickly . #% Is it going to work ? #% Catering swill arouses deep misgivings in my country because of the role it played in the recent foot and mouth epidemic . #% We can still do this . #% We also have to ensure that , within this new format , this debate is meaningful . #% Have the Member States been canvassed as to the extent to which they are prepared to make the contribution of 50 % which is needed ? #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , the rapporteur 's first draft was not well received in committee , because he was trying to cut back on red tape and to reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which , in fact , cause unemployment . #% We have to ensure that this is done correctly . #% On two details I will be voting against the amendment from our ultra-nationalistic and Catholic fundamentalists from Poland urging opposition to forced or ` coercive ' abortions . #% The Commission has an overall policy towards Vietnam , with which the House is familiar . #% Yet we subsidise the growing of tobacco plants while we cut down cannabis plants . #% Recently it has announced a fast , daily container service to Rotterdam . #% I make it clear now , and I said it in the Budgets Committee , that if Annex XV is maintained in its current form and if we have no guarantees about our rights I will vote against the Accession Treaty documents . #% He must know of the suspicions in this regard and precisely where they originate . #% They have a high priority , not only somewhere like the Arctic , but in other areas of the globe as well . #% In my report , that was passed by a very big majority in this House , we set the linear career structure on merit as the centre-piece of the reform . #% Thank you , Mr President , for your commitment to Aung San Suu Kyi and to the people of Burma . #% One , two , three . #% My understanding now is that the transposition on that point has been correct . #% It is , as the Commissioner has said , undergoing this process of rebuilding in possibly the most difficult times , especially from the economic point of view . #% You might say that what you are trying to do is effective , but my colleagues and I believe it is wrong . #% Fighting corruption is an essential first step . #% It will work in partnership with its workforce and it will encourage involvement , partnership and innovation . #% One practical way in which we can help is by buying Fair Trade products . #% Nevertheless , we congratulate Mrs Vlasto and restate our commitment to the creation of an environment that encourages small businesses to flourish . #% Will the Commissioner therefore be recommending that citizens of the European Union should be taking out additional medical insurance to cover the shortfall on the E111 form as they travel across the European Union ? #% Well how , precisely ? #% It is crucial for the centre to be enhanced and made effective . #% We are told that this is a road safety measure . #% The Commission will be presenting detailed proposals for the modernisation of disciplinary procedures and related arrangements in a consultative document which is scheduled for publication in October . #% During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that , in respect of least-developed , landlocked and island states , assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2 % loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10 % for the other ACP states . #% I will be interested to know how the Commission and the Council would react if we voted through this amendment to give an extra EUR 500 million next year for the rebuilding of Iraq . #% For example , there should be opportunities for young farmers , modern , light industrial estates on the edge of market towns , easy access to the information superhighway , sensitive development of tourism and recreation and new non-food uses for our skilled agricultural workforce . #% What is the research that has gone into your statement , if you have not taken account of all that has gone through this Parliament already , if you have not read in depth the work that has been done and the reports that have gone through this Parliament , in consultation with the Commission and other governments ? #% If you are to refuse an electronic check on the third part of Amendment 139 , which was properly called for immediately after that vote was announced , I would be grateful if you could explain to the House on what basis you are refusing that check . #% I agree with Mr Wilson that we must have clear decisions , uniform policies and continuity , because agriculture needs continuity . #% I think that this place , which has not managed to audit its own books for nearly 11 years , commenting on this is slightly absurd . #% It is an absolutely scandalous state of affairs that we are sitting here in a nine-tenths empty parliamentary Chamber , one week before Christmas , seeing a regulation which will come into effect no-one knows when or how , with a Council which is treating us with an aloof contempt . #% I would like to express my gratitude to Commissioner Gradin for what was a very informative and positive answer . #% Since then little has changed . #% I call on Thailand not to extradite those who are seeking refuge on its territory . #% I have referred to this in the debates in the Environment Committee . #% They can not cope with going down to the pub to tell their mates they have got breast cancer . #% 50.1 % in my constituency work over 72 hours a week as do 10 000 in the UK as a whole . #% We did choose the language very carefully and many might say that ` open to criticism ' might be a serious understatement . #% This has been endorsed by the Spring Council , which stated that key objectives requiring action at EU level included better conditions for research and development , improved education levels , a reduction in early school leavers and increased participation of youth , older workers and low-skilled workers in the labour market . #% It is because of this that a compromise has been reached to put the funding for the second tranche of EUR 1 500 into a reserve and it will remain there until the full costings of this proposal are established . #% Spyker Cars becomes Saab Spyker in a EUR 400 million deal but , make no mistake , this is not a normal commercial deal where one company pays and another company is paid . #% For example , the Nitrates Directive , despite being 13 years old , is only being complied with in two Member States . #% But in one country this is not so . #% I was also struck by the idea presented to us - at the enlightening hearing with experts when Mr Koukiadis was preparing this report - that the Community should and must have the wherewithal to protect its own property in the widest sense . #% It is important that we pay special attention to juvenile , urban and drug-related crime . #% For over 25 years concern has been growing in Europe about the way we produce our food in the drive for ever higher levels of production . #% We believe the recommended steps which a Member State should take when faced with future epidemics ( from the buying of vaccinations through to the reporting of facts to EU bodies ) are unwise and would not solve any major issues associated with H1N1 or future pandemics . #% We set down a road map in Cars 21 about the environmental and safety challenges that we expected the industry to meet , and the crucial thing there is to give them stability and knowledge so that they can plan and design their new products in a sensible and sequenced way , albeit with demanding deadlines and targets . #% The Commission 's proposals are right , even if there may be a risk of legal implications . #% These are the political guarantees , the procedural guarantees against over-centralisation , and the ministers in the Council can , and should , involve their national parliaments as well . #% I appeal to the Left not to let objections on points of detail obscure the big picture , so that we fulfil Parliament 's long-held commitment to legal rights for third-country nationals . #% 
I am aware that great efforts were made to give the workforce greater access to information and to protect the rights of small shareholders . #% I have written to you today to point out that four Members of this House have been invited to accept , by 3 p.m , the code of conduct imposed by the Labour Party in London preventing them from speaking to the press and that , in my view , this constitutes an infringement of the Rules of this House . #% I believe that innovative projects , on a smaller scale , can have just as much practical use - indeed if not more so - than those costing many millions of euros . #% It will come to pay the price in the 2004 European elections . #% But we need to know more about the incubation period , the epidemiology of the virus and how farming practices have been contributing factors . #% These are complex issues that need to be grappled with . #% Let me start by saying that we appreciate that the common position took on board some of our ideas from the first reading . #% Without this firm target , a major incentive to increased effort by the Bulgarian authorities is removed . #% Mr President , I rise in support of this report on rare diseases . #% I would like an assurance from the Minister that , if he has not done any pilot projects yet , if there are going to be any , or any real projects by Member States , he carries out that statistical exercise before allowing the projects to take place . #% There are examples of the Commission wanting a framework that facilitates trade as a first priority . #% If we could find some way not only of having a measure to take against former Commissioners who act in this way , but also against the companies who benefit from their knowledge , then I think that we might have two very powerful levers to use in future transgressions . #% She has more integrity in her little finger than those people have in the whole of their bodies and I demand , Mr President , that you suggest to the President of this Parliament that this matter be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee , with a view to seeing how a Member of Parliament under that sort of assault can be protected and allowed to do her job properly as a Member of this Parliament , as a rapporteur and as someone for whom we have great affection and respect . #% It is not good enough to come here and say that the developing countries were asking for too much . #% Madam President , I do not rise to make remarks with regard to Labour gags - although some of us think they have been a bit of a joke this week - #% On this occasion the Commission is not presenting anything - it is the Council which is presenting its draft budget . #% I should also like to thank him for his courtesy and cooperation with the committee 's inquiries . #% I think it is very difficult for the people of the United Kingdom to accept that their energy policy should be decided basically by foreigners . #% We congratulate Mr Viola on the work he has done and we hope that consistency will continue as we go through the year . #% Together we have gathered the experience on what are absolutely crucial issues , both for the future of the Commission and , indeed , for the future of the European Union as a whole . #% Earlier this year I went to a conference in Sweden organized by the Council of Europe at which there was discussion about the use of biomass , using trees , crops , all sorts of plants . #% Ways need to be found to prevent terrorist support groups from carrying out what are still regarded as legal acts in our countries , such as recruiting , indoctrinating , broadcasting and fund-raising in order to sustain illegal acts elsewhere . #% It is nice to see someone like him involved in dealing with the social area so that real progress can be made in this Parliament . #% The United Kingdom , along with many other countries within Europe , has many applicants for asylum , and there are large numbers of people on the move , seeking to migrate from one country to the other . #% It simply undermines the position of Parliament . #% The Committee on Budgets did not submit any amendments to the report for the simple reason that we are awaiting the outcome of a public hearing next month on the cost of enlargement . #% Translations , as we knew , were a problem but now it shows that the need for a litigation system , with specialist judges that are accessible within Member States , is another . #% My committee is now beginning to question whether the safety side , particularly as it refers to freight wagons , is starting to be compromised by this failure to implement European legislation . #% Truly , there should be no higher priority than to meet those needs . #% The reality is that with the collapse of the Soviet empire , the failure to make the transition from the Stakhanovite heavy industries of the past to the new light industries and a series of natural disasters , the economy is in complete crisis . #% I urge the House to support the motion . #% We have had nothing but positive contributions . #% I recognize that we already have something like 56 directives on the statute book as far as the car industry is concerned . #% It seems to me wrong that we should be legislating here on the basis that there is not a marked distinction between voluntary donations and paid donations . #% However , it is also clear that , given the new Community competence post-Amsterdam , there is every reason why the Community should operate as a Community within the conference . #% It was a privilege to be on the panel together with three other colleagues from this House . #% If we can take the underspends from this year and use a global ramassage for all the institutions , then we may find some method of frontloading to save the pains of next year 's budget . #% It is a timely debate with the rapidly changing transatlantic relationship today . #% It is short-sighted , too , for whilst Commissioner Mandelson is rolling out his plans for stronger bilateral links with emerging economies in Asia , it has incensed the Chinese , cut across EU-sponsored poverty reduction and hunger eradication programmes in Vietnam and shown an EU protectionist red flag to the region . #% So I commend this report to you all . #% Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ? #% But above all , we have addressed the issue of the non-binding short-term targets . #% If it occurs then we need to see how it is dealt with . #% Mr Andersson may have his own view about the case that was referred to in the TV documentary . #% Dealing with Iran has been made all the harder by the Iraq war , which was not just a disaster but could turn out to be an act of geopolitical folly . #% I do not see why , given that failing , extra powers should be given to it . #% At the same time , we must stop tying our hands behind our backs . #% First , it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact . #% Mercifully , in this instance , he is playing the cards on behalf of Romania and Bulgaria . #% Is that not the case and is it not the reason why my colleague Mr Wibe 's point needs to be addressed at Council level ? #% It is difficult work , taking account of an ever-increasing number of legal traditions and cultural values . #% I plead to all those who want Turkey to modernise on the basis of its European traditions to support our amendment . #% If we do not do that the whole exercise of the last few months will have been a waste of time and we will have made no further progress in what is after all a major event for the public in the European Union . #% Could we have some guidance as to what the presidency will do about this particular section of the resolution ? #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of the Committee on International Trade 's draftsman , Mr Sjöstedt , who is on Hong Kong with virtually all the other members of the committee apart from me . #% The concerns , particularly about the waiver , are misguided precisely because it would be very limited : it would be limited to only EUR 150 on any particular card . #% Nobody wanted to change the Treaties : the Tindemans report avoided proposing Treaty changes and the Three Wise Men report in 1979 advised against changing the Treaties . #% My last point is that for almost the past 15 years -- all the time I have been in this Parliament and on the Committee on Budgets -- the rapporteur for the financial perspectives has been Mr Colom i Naval . #% The sovereignty of Iraq is at stake , and we should place our trust in this democratically elected Government of Iraq . #% It will undermine the value of a system that is working well already . #% In some cases it will depend on the form of the proposals , given our commitment to subsidiarity ; in others , it will depend on their exact content . #% All sorts of legal arguments have been raised against the petitioners and I do not seek to deal with those in detail here , but will merely say that they are set out and dealt with seriously in the report - the question of both the temporal and geographic application of the Treaty to Greenland and the issue of the application to military incidents . #% Not enough has changed yet in the world to justify changing that . #% A number of amendments concerned informing the employees of the target or offeree company , and another amendment concerned the importance of consulting the employees of the offeror or predatory company . #% This is not my seat - this is Mr Lomas ' seat . #% I believe that we should reduce to 250 mg and I am glad to see that I am in good company , though not alas that of Mr Bowis . #% 
There are some lines which we can not step over : not just in this instance but also with regard to aspects of asbestos , for example , which threatens hormones in beef . #% The Romanian flags being waved then had holes where the symbol was cut out in the middle . #% I remember from my visit to Bulgaria the great interest of Bulgarian judges in what we are doing and want to pursue at Union level . #% We do not have , or we do not apparently have in place , any mechanism across the European Union to try and take advantage of that opportunity , or to try and deter at the point of introduction of the euro the threat of counterfeiting . #% Every company which deals with contracting entities in any of the utilities sectors will have to adjust its working practices to conform with the rules that we impose upon them . #% We are seeing such results all over Europe , from Scotland to Spain to Germany . #% Continuing reform is needed in Bulgaria , not just because of EU accession but for the sake of Bulgaria and its people . #% The only problem was how to get them home through customs , so I did not buy them ! #% Mr President , as a member of the Delegation to the EU-Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee I congratulate the Commission and the Romanian Government on their continued cooperation in moving close to preparedness for full accession . #% I look at the empty seats over there and see that the Council appears not to be interested either in the work of the Ombudsman or in the work of the Committee on Petitions . #% We strive to ensure that there is effective burden-sharing , but I am mindful of the fact that we are counselled continually by those who are expert in this field that a more liberal attitude towards the purchase of goods from Third World countries would do more to stimulate world trade and conquer poverty , and thereby stem immigration , than possibly any other measure . #% The prospectus directive is designed to establish the ground rules under which an issuer of shares , bonds or other securities may access investors throughout the 15 Member States . #% When we look in particular at Africa , where millions and millions of lives are being ravaged , and when we look across Europe , where more and more young people are becoming infected with the HIV virus , what we have to look at is not only the accessibility of treatment , but also the cost of treatment . #% Fourth and finally , I agree with the Commission on the need for more transparency . #% Similarly , one amendment attempts to extend the scope of the regulation to taxation : this is simply not acceptable . #% The task of such a centre then should be to channel relevant information on anticipated changes to decision-makers at all levels to help increase our overall capacity to prepare the policy changes necessary to harness the opportunities to be gained from the perceived direction of change . #% However , as the Commission will be aware , motorists throughout Europe are much more European than perhaps we think . #% My country , the UK , and Ireland - both of which are of course outside Schengen - gave Taiwanese citizens visa-free privileges a year and a half ago . #% For example , one could be forgiven for thinking that bacon labelled `` packed in the UK '' was produced in Britain under our most stringent welfare standards ; not so . #% Finally , we must be aware that there is always the possibility of the need for major intervention in the Middle East , and I would love to know where the money would come from . #% All this demonstrates that the divide between the Kurdish parties at the present time goes deeper than that which divides them from their outside enemies and it is a massive threat to the real interests of all Kurds . #% In saying that , I do not wish to take anything away from the very close working relationship that the European Parliament had with the Commission throughout . #% That is just one way of looking at it though it is not the most important . #% Schools and shops close and bus routes close down . #% My colleagues and I are wholly sympathetic to the special needs of the EU 's outermost regions given their isolation and the problems this causes . #% If this happened , it would of course have a devastating effect on all Scillonians , whether or not they actually use the service . #% Therefore , monitors and permanently-installed signs scrolling through the various languages would be a very important addition . #% The peoples of Europe will not forgive politicians putting their self-interest above the security of the people . #% Lastly , we need that information from all Member States in complete form -- the stocks , antivirals , vaccines , masks , the health checks at ports and the quarantine facilities -- in order to know that we are genuinely prepared against this threat throughout the European Union . #% The question we have tabled tonight goes to what we regard - and I hope that you will share our opinion - as the very heart of the reforms you are putting together . #% There really is not a difficulty with including the small further step which the rapporteur is asking for . #% Furthermore , future enlargement of the EU is specifically linked to the revival of the EU constitutional process , to which I fundamentally object . #% As a result , I am not here to recommend acceptance of any of the 22 amendments that we have before us , although I feel Amendments Nos 3 and 5 do help in the wording . #% It is even more important now that we find a solution , especially as both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers . #% What Commissioner Wallström correctly called a stand-off in her speech this afternoon will not be solved unless the European Union visibly shifts its position towards that of developing countries . #% I suggest we look at it in the Environment Committee and then take the matter further from there , rather than taking up time in the plenary during what is an exceptionally busy week here in Strasbourg . #% Secondly , to the Commission : I welcome Mr Kinnock 's statement . #% Lastly , I regretted very much , as far as the Mediterranean is concerned , that there was a complete defeat for the Commission , it would seem to me , on the swordfish issue - in that sort of area there was a complete sell-out . #% But now , as he has to clear up this mess , we ought to hear from him how he will do so . #% We must ask the Irish presidency to tear up its original plans and timetable for its presidency and focus first and foremost on this . #% One of the great complaints from our farmers has been that in the past they have not been given sufficient time to make sensible decisions . #% Nevertheless , they are given trade preferences . #% In particular , I would ask it to abandon the idea of requiring 140 mm mesh size and also to recognise the extent to which the Scottish fleet depends on a mixed fishery . #% I therefore hope that if Parliament as a whole agrees , we may be able to deal with this proposal in a single reading , which will in turn convey a significant message around the globe . #% They understand our need to air concerns when they arise and when they are brought to us . #% It is those electronic communications that are really opening up the way to a global trade in services that we have never seen before . #% Surely this Parliament and this continent have gone beyond the days of Henry V and Joan of Arc ? #% Arms brokers and end use will require close monitoring . #% Mr President , last week marked the first anniversary of the Beslan massacre , which resulted in the deaths of 331 people , of which 186 were children . #% I suppose you could call 26 years of unbroken dictatorship stability of a sort , but it is hardly conducive to development . #% I was particularly disturbed to read that 13 % of British Muslims support suicide bombers . #% Access to medicines will be a key issue at Doha in a few weeks ' time simply because developing countries feel hugely disadvantaged by rules which are applied universally , even though countries are of unequal strength , both economically and institutionally . #% They were challenged by some people who do not accept the fact that markets deliver jobs , deliver economic prosperity and therefore deliver the sort of social benefits that Mr Miller was advocating so eloquently earlier on . #% It should be a positive list which is rapidly expanded , with maximum dosages linked to real needs and not to outmoded daily allowances . #% The Danish people have a right to know in advance of the referendum on 28 September where the `` no '' campaign funds have come from . #% What really matters is the loss of democracy . #% Madam President , in spite of what was said earlier on the other side of this House , it is clear that the police exercised systematic physical and psychological torture in Genoa . #% We would argue that now is the right time and that decision should not be delayed . #% This was a clear violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention 1961 , which forbids diplomats from interfering in the internal affairs of host states . #% It may seem rather over-elaborate to talk of them as building blocks , but they are an appropriate way to move forward . #% It is now time for him to roll back from his current position , to acknowledge our core values , to make them shared values . #% Accession countries are encouraged to seek EU membership as a beacon of democracy , liberty and tolerance but the Blair-Aznar-Berlusconi trio are making a mockery of that . #% This will avoid the codecision procedure , which would kick in after the end of the month , and it also avoids the strong advice of the Commission that the Council should reconsult Parliament . #% I suggest that we give some thought to turning this building into a European university . #% If the 16 compromise amendments , and the others already agreed with the presidency , are passed , we can proceed to set up the new EFSA . #% We still have to reform our common agricultural policy before it bankrupts us financially and politically . #% 
On the Lisbon Agenda , I welcome many of the Presidency conclusions but , sadly , Europe has yet to find an answer to its underlying economic malaise . #% I suspect my own country will not do so well there but perhaps we would do better on the use of information technology . #% Even more briefly , on Amendment No 2 , which did indeed come in my name : at that stage , we tabled this because we believed that if there was to be a vote through this Parliament for tests at twenty-four months in all the Member States quasi-imposed upon them by the Commission , this needed to be amended with a provision that those Member States which already have other forms of testing - or in the case of the United Kingdom , the over thirty-month cow - should not have to go through that procedure . #% Will you , Commissioner , urge the Council to agree that we should ring-fence the money in any unallocated money that we may find under Heading IV ? #% There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others , that their need for support is not given a real practical response . #% I would urge , and I know Commissioner Byrne agrees with this , to have one policy throughout Europe . #% This is almost unique among all UN missions : it is the only one without a human rights mandate . #% The innovation and the technology are going to come from there as well . #% We hear fine words from the Presidency , fine words from the Council but we do not see the money . #% Would it not be absolutely brilliant if the whole of the European Union were amongst those first forty countries which led to the treaty being fully ratified ? #% Already there have been 74 000 deaths and getting aid to those in need is a race against time . #% We can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7 , since that fits with the precautionary approach . #% But in making that market , in securing its foundations , we must not forget children . #% Aid for trade is also welcome , although I have reservations about the World Bank and the IMF being in charge of it , bearing in mind the emphasis on conditionalities for which they are so well known . #% Therefore , the embargo is a reflection of the illegal nature of the invasion by Turkey . #% It clearly makes no sense and the Council needs to ask the Commission to look at this very serious matter because chaos could well result , undermining the very principle that all of us are trying to contribute to , namely the completion of the single market . #% Technical measures have been recognized by the industry as being one of the most important areas for progress . #% You spend these 18 years in prison , away from your family , enduring a legal process that goes back and forth , condemning you to death , then finding you innocent , then starting again until every appeal is exhausted and you are finally condemned to death a second time . #% As long as I hold my position in this House I will , of course , fight for unity between the North Atlantic democracies in promoting a common vision for the future . #% What is clear is that some of those weeping crocodile tears yesterday for anti-Semitic attacks in Italy in order to get cheap publicity , today voted in a way that could only give aid and assistance to the racists , the anti-Semites and the extreme right in the European Union . #% I thank in particular Mr Magri and his officials for being here all this time . #% I have written to the Commission about the demobilization of over half the UNITA forces in Angola . #% Even today we have heard talk of James Bond , of American espionage and we have had the rantings of the madman to my left a few moments ago . #% The Danish Government refused , due to lack of evidence of his participation in criminal acts . #% in writing . - The construction industry represents various vital issues in the European Union , ranging from its significant contribution to the economy to the safety of EU citizens in their homes and places of work . #% I am proud of the momentum towards Fair Trade that now exists in the North East of England , with more and more places signing up as Fair Trade towns . #% Mr Ryan referred to a very interesting point in the report : that there is evidence that corruption falls as the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rises . #% Madam President , I would like to thank both rapporteurs for their conscientious work and also the Ombudsman and his team for their hard work in ensuring that the rights of citizens and residents are upheld and good practice is pursued , if not always attained . #% China is also obstructing full democracy in Hong Kong , dear to my heart as a British MEP . #% If that becomes the occasion for mob violence against Italian citizens , I would submit that it would set back EU-Turkey relations a long way . #% Fewer than 5 % of motorists drive over the legal limit but they alone cause 20 % of the fatal accidents . #% There is already a forum through which European nations address transatlantic security matters - that is called Nato . #% It is a hugely exciting moment . #% Now all eyes are on President Klaus and what he may or may not do next week , and it is interesting . #% This project provokes the expression ` EU ai n't seen nothing yet ' or even the Northern expression ` Ee , did you call ? ' #% It is for these reasons that the British Conservatives support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market 's amendments to the draft directive . #% We have discussed this quite thoroughly in the Socialist Group and our understanding is that the Irish Government and any other Member State government already has the power under existing legislation to make the changes that Mr Gillis wants . #% We should not lose sight of that , even in these very difficult times . #% Secondly , the breadth . #% All of these things are causing us deep concern and we have seen little , if any , action on all of these important issues . #% I want to recommend to Parliament that it accept the Commission proposal . #% I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans , no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency . #% The President-in-Office may recall that in January I asked him in Strasbourg if it was possible that we could invite President Mandela to Cardiff to sign an agreement . #% We have to recognize , however , that the idea of having an industrial policy for the pharmaceutical industry is rather different from the other industries we have dealt with in the past . #% The independence of our universities is far too important for them to be sacrificed on the altar of political integration . #% The world economies outside Europe will show no mercy to us , nor should we expect them to . #% This was at the heart of the report adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy by 40 votes to 5 . #% But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban ? #% This Parliament would like to see those pledges turned into real and immediate financial assistance as quickly as possible . #% We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information . #% It is in the Commission 's interest as well as in our own interest . #% The closures of the nuclear power plants at Ignalina and Kozloduy both require an energy strategy which takes neighbouring countries into account . #% Men need specialist services too . #% This resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move . #% Some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so . #% I hope that , in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament , not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way , but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union . #% One statement I would like to make as a British Member of the European Parliament , in response to some of my colleagues ' comments earlier on , is that I personally would like to back the campaign to move the Elgin Marbles back to Greece . #% Regional policy pushed to put these projects in the hands of the voluntary sector and now they seem to be disadvantaged . #% This would be the minimum that we could expect in the framework of loyal cooperation between the institutions . #% That is far from being the case : this is in the nature of a safeguard , the right to blow the whistle occasionally where you think that things may be going wrong . #% The prime effects so far appear to be during the period of foetal development , rather than in adults . #% We also need to put flesh on the bones of our human rights commitments in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Malta has to be judged the same as any other country . #% Stop the paramilitaries , end the killings , respect human rights ! #% Secondly , my question relates to the prospect for the Relex family of directorates under the new Commission . #% The fact is that at Hampton Court there was no fundamental reappraisal of the European Union . #% 
It is vital to recognise Chinese Walls where the proposal is being switched from a law which can be applied only to individuals to a law which can be applied to companies . #% The debate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is already starting to refer to an ` inconvenient ' Article 3 , which is the one that deals with inhumane and degrading treatment and which can not be derogated from . #% Much nonsense has also been talked about control of Iraqi oil . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I have to express some regret at the obsession on the left side of this Parliament with nuclear energy , which has meant that we have two resolutions before the House today , most of the content of which has much in common except for this issue of nuclear energy , particularly when it is the only proven technology to supply large volumes of ultra low-carbon electricity in Europe . #% Successive leaders have used Islam to justify repression of minorities and justify autocracy , particularly of a military nature , although recent government efforts to remedy this must be recognised . #% This seems to be a loophole . #% There are many good examples in that document of the valuable background material which we were able to use during discussions in committee . #% Of course we welcome any commitments by European states to modernise their armed forces in order to redress the present well-known deficiencies . #% This year we are doing so . #% They were going ahead as pioneers and this article symbolized the fact that they were leaving the door open to the others to follow later but keeping the contacts going : a very wise decision as history proved because the other states did eventually catch up with them . #% But you only mentioned very briefly the largest and most difficult of the dossiers , namely Poland . #% The losers , sadly , will be our own citizens . #% The EU and the West need to support the social as well as the economic recovery of the country . #% I think Mr Reinfeldt and his government deserve our thanks for the way they have done this but , as has been the situation in many Presidencies , they have also had to accommodate a lot of internal institutional distractions - in this case , in relation to the Lisbon Treaty . #% If so , will you please write to the European Court of Justice expressing our concern over this issue . #% The bigger the area in which democratic decisions have to be made , the easier it is to slip into remoteness . #% I hope that the Conference of Presidents can give positive consideration to the request made by Mr Evans that the votes be brought forward tomorrow morning , so as to enable those British Members , and other Members , who may want to watch the funeral on television to do so . #% Yet the popular condemnation by the majority of Pakistanis of the violence of the militants shows that extremism remains a fringe minority activity in Pakistan . #% That is why I am very pleased that the PSE Group has prevailed on me and made me see sense and that we have Compromise Amendment No 112 , which says that , based on type-approval , we should phase out the use of HFCs and substitute with CO2 from 2012 , with a two-year exemption , or two-year delay at least , for some of the smaller manufacturers -- what we call the Porsche exemption -- , moving towards CO2 , which is a much better goal , not only environmentally , but politically too . #% I welcome that sort of not quite sharing but working closely together on the right of initiative , as regards both proposing and withdrawing . #% I received my religious teaching in that very same mosque system . #% Mr President , in this year we should highlight the problems but also celebrate the achievements of people living with disability , not just people of genius -- the Beethovens , Miltons , Van Goughs and Stephen Hawkings -- but those who are unknown . #% Mr President , I should also like to thank Mr Castagnetti for his report and for being prepared to take on board so many of my amendments in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment . #% That is not a problem for large manufacturers , but it is a very serious problem for the small ones . #% There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance . #% I remember as a six-year-old schoolchild being sent to collect a Hungarian refugee child who was to join my class at my school in Gloucestershire , on his first day . #% ( Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE #% I ask the Commission to ensure that Parliament remains fully involved on a timely basis in any consideration of the use of safeguard clauses . #% We are experiencing an international crisis and we can allow nothing to undermine our fight against terrorism and those that perpetrate it . #% The Council and Commission have told us that this is already covered fully in the access and interconnection directive , but colleagues have not agreed with that . #% She is , to put it mildly , a controversial figure . #% I am also concerned by a lack of consistency . #% The progress of others will be monitored very carefully . #% I would also wish to see such courses paying special attention to the needs of the smaller farm where new entrants are most likely to be found . #% They will subsequently have to look at their situation in the newly elected Parliament after the elections , as will every group , on the basis of the verdict of the electorate . #% As has been said , Canada is one of Europe 's oldest partners , and strengthening our relations across the Atlantic has become a priority for both sides . #% I want to reiterate that it is important for these networks to be independent and capable of representing the concerns of their members . #% Some services cooperate very well ; some are setting up briefing meetings for Members of Parliament - but others are not . #% This report sends a strong political signal to the Commission and Council that this Parliament wants this crucial area - the evolution of the Next Generation of Internet and electronic communication - to be reflected in the crucial decisions on research support that are about to made in the context of the Framework Six Programme . #% To those I would point out that in the period of 2000 to 2006 , we will spend one thousandth of one percent of the EU 's GDP on the candidate countries . #% Regardless of whether human rights issues in the past may have been treated as purely domestic considerations , increasingly now they are not . #% I am very pleased with this Council common position document , which reads far better and more intelligibly than the initial Commission proposals . #% One of the arguments that was always put against British membership of the European Union was that it would mean that we would be turning our backs on the Commonwealth and that Europe was an inward-looking small club of rich nations that did not care about the rest of the world . #% In relation to Kosovo , we are concerned about the cuts being proposed and we need more information as to why they are necessary . #% What is needed is harmonization of the testing methods , and that is being considered by the working group . #% Mr President , should I be unable to speak about the content , I would only say that the previous remark from the PPE side of the House is complete baloney . #% I am not asking the Commission to withdraw its proposals about carrier pre-selection . #% It is over two weeks since the referendum took place in East Timor . #% There are at least 16 million businesses within the EU , 99.9 % of them are micro to medium-sized . #% I am sure you are not , but I would hate my British Socialist colleagues to be embarrassed by the way they have just voted , in some cases against the UK budget rebate . #% Furthermore these deals are morally repugnant , in that they directly and indirectly cause the deaths of hundreds of indigenous black African fishermen every year . #% Aid has to be properly spent , but proper aid has to be there in the first place , alongside better free trade and the untying of aid to African countries so that money is spent on what is needed , not on the things that we would like to see it spent on . #% I only joined the Committee on Budgetary Control a couple of months ago , and to me the meetings and the reports of the last two months have raised probably more questions than they have answered . #% This small but proudly independent new country has made huge progress , since the Velvet Divorce ten years ago , in modernising its economy from a command one to a functioning market . #% Mr President , I voted in favour of the motion of censure because I believe that this Commission has failed to deliver the reforms it was asked to get on with five years ago . #% The Commission must speed up its program to codify existing Community legislation , not simply as an exercise in reducing the number of pages of the acquis communitaire , but to provide greater transparency and ease of access to all . #% If they are real terrorists , then let them face justice and not languish in a detention camp that the Americans do not even dare to put within their own country . #% While the Commission is trying to ban tobacco companies from using their post-tax profits on sports sponsorship , the Commission is supporting by over ECU 1 billion a tobacco regime as if it were a healthy agricultural pursuit . #% It is of particular importance , because today much of our food and drink comes from the developing world , where farmers and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a decent living . #% We said ` never again ' in 1994 after Rwanda , and what we face now is the first genocide of the 21st century , unless we end this complacency and do something . #% While it remains the case that Member States are not implementing their laws , I really find it unacceptable that we should continue to infringe personal liberties . #% That is the position of our group , subject to the arguments we are listening to now . #% They are all parts of a clearly integrated approach . #% The sooner the Marco Polo Programme becomes active , the better for Europe 's transport sector . #% Mr President , I add my compliments to Mr Alyssandrakis for his report and the work that he brings to this particular field of our committee 's activities . #% I welcome the fact that many Member States have joined the action brought by the Commission in the case against the big American tobacco companies before the European Court of Justice . #% 
What works best is not clear . #% The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties ; the Commission proposed 10 years ago that the opt-out should exist . #% That means we need to look at new technologies in the field of emissions and fuel consumption . #% Indoctrinated by old adverts and TV celebrity , they believed that , as we say in the UK , the future is bright , the future is orange . #% The nation states would be far better off looking after their own interests . #% The problem is that we need to look very carefully at the Member States and at their liability laws is to see where development risk leads us if it is included or excluded . #% The health of our citizens must take precedence over the profits of multinational companies . #% Was it justifiable to cut off electricity to half of the inhabitants of Gaza , to close nearly every school , and even to stop fishermen from taking to their boats ? #% These two committees have treated their role differently but in my opinion both demonstrate the value of the new procedure . #% However , the EC has frequently commented on such matters , and the Commission in particular has made some excellent statements . #% It says it believes that because of the degree of uncertainty inherent in any statistical method and because it will be some years before the DASS has required sufficient maturity , the Court 's findings must be interpreted with caution . #% In most cases , ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect both the interests of farmers and the trade secrets of the manufacturers . #% The effects of implementing the proposals contained in this Commission document will be immense . #% In particular , taken together , they will , in my view , offer new opportunities for bus and coach service operators which will in turn generate much needed new jobs in the transport industry . #% The Staff Regulation rules governing leave on personal grounds will be clarified by the reform amendments proposed by the Commission which , as the honourable Member will know , are currently before the Council . #% We in UKIP will put a non-racist agenda to the British people at the European elections , saying that it is time to put British interests first . #% It is a major task which has been undertaken and indeed , if it is fulfilled in time and ensures that minority groups etc. are also included on it , this will really be an historic achievement by the Bangladeshi authorities . #% We talk about mine clearance which is vastly important , and I appreciate all the work that has been going on as far as the European Union is concerned . #% It would in my opinion be a legal nightmare . #% Coming on the back of the cold-blooded murder of a civilian settler and the continuing firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza on to Israeli civilian areas , Prime Minister Olmert had no choice but to launch the limited surgical intervention by the IDF . #% So we have to ask the question : why does such a discrepancy exist Why are there such stark contrasts in terms of the sheer scale of the poverty of people ' s lives in Africa and , of course the resulting lack of proper health services , education , and AIDS treatments . #% Clearly the agency ' s mandate does not cover assistance in the other countries of former Yugoslavia or other Balkan countries because this structure is the specific European Union instrument for the reconstruction of Kosovo . #% It also means , of course , that the two-year rollover of the present system of pay and pensions will provide stability and security for all the institutions , which would not have been the case if the Council and Parliament had not agreed to our proposal on that . #% Mr President , we are here to debate the situation in Syria and in particular the changes that have taken place since President Bashir al Assad took over from his father some three years ago . #% Most temporary workers in the UK and some other Member States are covered on health and safety grounds . #% Mr President , I have a speech here , but I must admit that Mrs Jackson has rather distracted me into thinking about how things get better and better after you reach a certain age . #% Will the Commission maintain its pressure to persuade the French Government to honour also this previous commitment to pay compensation and , incidentally , suggest to them that this would considerably mitigate the increasing irritation felt by other Member States towards France , not just because of their mishandling of the lorry blockade issue but also , more recently , their mishandling of the distribution of World Cup tickets ? #% We regard this as a positive and are thus , in principle , supportive . #% -- Mr President , various speakers have made the point this morning that it is time not to panic , but rather to plan . #% Mr President , as has already been stated , there are 400 000 multiple sclerosis sufferers across the whole of the European Union , but it has taken only one today to get this debate , a remarkable young women who has already been mentioned , Louise McVay , who is in the gallery at the moment . #% Equally , Israel must meet her obligations by freezing settlement activity , restoring Palestinian freedom of movement , ending targeted assassinations and ensuring that the security fence does not encroach on Palestinian land . #% In particular I welcome his latest compromise proposal on paying for the costs of dealing with orphan waste . #% I strongly support the action which has been taken . #% Of course there is still a long way to go - eliminating discards , for example - and there are times when the Commission still seems to veer towards micro-management . #% That could instigate economic development in the north of Kosovo . #% It is right that we provide here for a six-year delay in implementation , that we have a thorough review before that deadline approaches and that all the Member States enlist the relevant professional organizations to ensure that small retailers are adequately informed in due time of what the provisions must be , particularly in relation to the marking on the shelf of the products concerned . #% If we want to continue to swell the ranks of anti-Europeanism , then carry on , Commission . #% Resolution 1441 calls us also to witness and to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the EU supports the Kimberley Process , which aims to eliminate African conflict diamonds - or so-called blood diamonds - from the global market . #% However , from the outset , this report was couched in a federalist language that sought to promote a fake or forced European demos , and the attempt to rename the scheme the European Union Heritage Label was politically based and would exclude thousands of potential locations whose history and heritage predates , and indeed overshadows , many contemporary sites . #% At one hundred miles away from the source of the sound , the noise can still cause shearing of the tissues in the air sack behind whales ' and dolphins brains . #% Has the Commission considered the potential costs and benefits of the EU unilaterally eliminating all its subsidies and import tariffs on agricultural products and how this might benefit the EU , developing countries and the WTO negotiations ? #% Our citizens ' security and prosperity will depend on how effectively the Union can respond to global challenges in a world very different from that only a decade ago . #% That is true in my own constituency in the east of England , where we are not simply talking about a very significant part of the economy where cooperatives are active , but also about socially useful employment at one and the same time . #% All too often European citizens do not feel that this is actually the case . #% We can then adopt a coherent approach to sustainable development and see if we really are achieving the results we want . #% If we go on selling this project to the peoples of Europe on a lie , we are more likely than not to stoke up and cause bitter resentments and extreme nationalism . #% Their joyfulness is tempered only by the continuation of the bitter legacy of Saddam . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the absence of Mrs Wemheuer , the coordinator and Mr Tomlinson who is our spokesman on this issue . #% He has not been seen since 1987 ; his daughter was an infant when he was taken hostage . #% I therefore ask that you refer the matter to the appropriate committee for urgent consideration . #% This debate will continue . #% I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus . #% Many of the losers are poor people who find their land taken away from them by large commercial firms or their livelihoods destroyed by new and often unfair competition from cheaper imports . #% However , there are certain lessons we can draw from our experience . #% Finally , the big idea is this transatlantic market where we need to mobilise our business and political communities and listen to those we represent so that we can shape the world of tomorrow to our mutual benefit . #% Four members of the Council of Baltic Sea States are EU Members already , while four are applying for membership : Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland . #% We in the West must increase the involvement of African scientists in international collaborative science and R&D projects , and reinforce existing research infrastructure . #% By contrast , the rapporteur and the Committee , in calling for a sales and marketing ban , are maintaining the previous signal and the moral guidance about the relationship between humans and animals : that we do not accept that cruelty should be practised on animals for no better purpose than to develop products which are essentially frivolous and designed to flatter our vanity . #% The amendments of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy set out to remedy this with a remission of eight months maximum . #% The very people and the very Member States who were shrugging off your warnings two years ago , who were denying you a qualified majority , as you said just a few months ago , are now clamouring for compensation and support as the beef market collapses and we face the prospect of millions of animals in store , unsellable , undisposable of over the next two years . #% It should ensure that it meets the deadline , to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004 , and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners . #% I point out again in this House that those countries that have not adopted the euro have the lowest levels of unemployment . #% The CFP is also a disaster on a technical level . #% When it comes to the compromise package that we will vote on I am prepared to recommend to colleagues that we do not support this area but on condition that the Commission assures us that it will continue to keep this under very close scrutiny when it comes to looking at the Television without Frontiers directive and also to encourage the fair access provisions . #% As we are increasingly sending missions to Aceh -- which I very much welcome as the former chief observer to the Indonesian elections -- and to the Democratic Republic of Congo , we need that democratic control . #% 
This is nothing new , but it is good from time to time in this House to remind ourselves of the true nature of the Aliyev regime . #% If I was not the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I would say that I agree with those sentiments , but since I am the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I could not possibly say any such thing . #% So the answer lies in your own text , Commissioner , I hope perhaps we can review this in that context . #% Today , we heard the Commissioner again trying to explain the inexplicable , claiming that his actions with regard to the reinstatement of the Chinese textile quotas were carried out diligently and transparently and that the difficulties arising from this nonsense of a compromise were caused by unforeseen circumstances . #% So although I am disappointed that the President-in-Office of the Council looks for agreement between the two Member States , surely this is an area where the Council , out of concern for human rights and following the ruling of an institution not in the EU , but one which it respects and is included in part of the Amsterdam Treaty , should take positive steps ? #% If it is in the interests of security or information on visitors , why is the information not required from every visitor ? #% It aims to provide opportunities for those who are taking part in work-linked training and their employers to benefit from the trainees or apprentices receiving part of their training in another Member State and for that training to be accredited . #% One hopes that when Mrs Liddell goes to the Council she can come back and report to Parliament that the additional resources that have been provisionally agreed can be agreed in total . #% The Commission is entirely wrong to assert that lobby groups are scaremongering . #% I have raised the matter with the President and I hope that the Committee on Institutional Affairs would look at this in the context of the next IGC . #% That is exactly what is happening , as there is now such a case before the English High Court . #% Now this has become something more like : although Member States have the lead , there are aspects where coordination at European level is important . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , firstly I would like to make one point . #% That is generally undesirable , but in any case , what model would we take ? #% His instrument for enforcing this tyranny was , of course , the Chinese Communist Party , which still governs China . #% I would counsel you and the Commission to please keep your ill-informed noses out of small businesses ! #% The UK Presidency is trying to downplay this whole directive , claiming that it is all very straightforward and that the fuss is far-fetched . #% I also extend those thanks to Commissioner Tajani and his team in the time that he has been in the Transport Commissioner 's seat . #% I was one of the most critical people when it came to the original draft . #% No doubt reconciling the egos of so many aged male leaders is going to prove quite a challenge ; increasing public opposition to the Constitution will not help either . #% Naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible . #% With so much at stake between the major financial nations , a reconsideration of issues such as capital ratios and leverage demand stronger oversight by Parliament . #% Observers are estimating that the resulting food crisis has led to the premature deaths of 3 million North Koreans , one in eight of the population . #% Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate you for having presided over a Commission that has contributed so much to the political unification of Europe . #% That is a vital challenge to Parliament . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Coelho on a very strong report , which is concrete and specific . #% The Code does not apply to nurses recruited by private agencies . #% Let us hope that we have many more examples of this very important and progressive step forward . #% The European Training Foundation can be useful as a tool in helping to implement essential partnerships and will provide the new programmes and the formal frameworks for EU aid to candidate countries . #% Such problems could be compounded by the fact that different rules apply to different sectors . #% But for potential legislators , there must be responsibility too . #% Fifthly , are we being fair to local authorities ? #% We also support the EU 's serious organised crime strategy , targeting gangs who trade on the trafficking of people , guns and dogs , confiscating profits illicitly gained and working with European organisations on the EU border . #% It must be said that this history goes back a long way to 1997 . #% We must in particular draw attention to intrusion or possible intrusion by the press . #% In particular there is the use of voluntary agreements in the promotion of a carbon dioxide tax . #% Could you please reassure this House that we will not just turn to the creation of more EU legislation , which no doubt at some point in the future will itself be overturned by a European court , but instead tell us how we can effectively support Greece and other Member States that are currently operating under such burdens ? #% Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities , such as a school , a post office and a shop . #% Finally , can we really take the high ground and complain about the Chinese Government subsidising the footwear industry when we spend so much of our EU budget on subsidising inefficient farmers ? #% We want local authorities to put in contracts on a consistent open basis that will give our citizens value for money . #% However , in March , following a takeover of the Taliban by a hard-line faction linked to bin Laden , the extraordinarily beautiful 5th-century Buddhist statues in Bamiyan were destroyed with dynamite . #% But as I say , this is a very different type of IGC and therefore we have to be imaginative in the way that we present ourselves to the public . #% Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Johanna Boogerd-Quaak for the excellent work she has done on this report . #% Firstly , I welcome paragraph 6 and Mr Monti 's remarks that we should move away from hard infrastructure towards soft infrastructure . #% We did not feel it was necessary to table any substantive amendments to the framework directive because we felt that it covered the strategy that Parliament had laid down . #% Is there any better way of doing that than in sport ? #% Safety of our environment and avoidance of energy poverty among those people , particularly in the South-East of England who live on fixed incomes , are equally important objectives . #% I welcome Parliament 's support for that . #% I have received letters , emails and representations from people who fear that governments will be able to listen to their telephone conversations and read their emails ! #% A draconian set of laws threaten dissidents and journalists who speak out and people like Lim Guan Eng , an opposition MP , are already in jail for sedition ; Irene Fernandez , head of a women 's organization , is on trial for publishing allegations of abuses in immigration centres ; Param Kumaraswami , a UN special rapporteur , faces a $ 25m defamation suit brought by two Malaysian companies , and the government refuses to recognize his immunity . #% The right of the people of East Timor to reject autonomy and demand full independence must be fully ensured . #% Some people who are having periods of reflection are otherwise known to be ` in retreat ' and some retreats are made in better order than others . #% One out of six is simply not good enough . #% We have access to staff and technology to assist us with our work , and far greater opportunities to cooperate and work together , as we are now in our preparations for Addis Ababa at the end of this week . #% If there are problems then , we and the Council must have the courage of our convictions to act effectively in those circumstances . #% The amendment from the EPP , however , clarifies the paragraph and should , in our view , be supported . #% I fully support the aims and objectives of this proposal . #% We have reached a satisfactory outcome for all concerned . #% So I was perfectly satisfied that Article 235 is quite sufficient and proper in these circumstances . #% We must not forget , however , that this is a proposal from the Commission . #% Mr President , I too should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , especially Mr McCartin , who has taken a reasonable amount of flak from me . #% You could not make this up ! #% That being so , we recognise the Conference of Presidents ' decision last week to refuse to have a separate debate . #% This is not a debate about how to solve the problems in the Middle East . #% Consequently we are going to be supporting the amendment on that which will be coming from another group this afternoon . #% But the Lisbon Treaty is , in our view , still a step in the wrong direction . #% 
Really , it is the people who are not here who need to understand the importance of explaining what the European Union does . #% The phrase ` illegal trafficking ' is used or added to ensure -- or we hope to ensure -- linguistic clarity and to avoid any ambiguity . #% Whilst I support market solutions like tax incentives , these should be applied by Member States according to national criteria if they so wish . #% The captain gathered us together imploring us to have more team spirit . #% However , I see no certain gains from growing GM products in Europe . #% In the United Kingdom , in the 1960s , we had some 25,000 adoptions , with 12,500 under one-year-olds . #% Secondly , can he confirm whether any of his or Commissioner Kinnock 's cabinet have actively lobbied MEPs for support of the Socialist Group , and in particular for Mrs Morgan 's amendments on the Stauner report ? #% I remind the House , because I gather there is much fear that Mr Sharon may be elected prime minister , that the peace process in the Middle East , from the Israeli point of view , has always advanced under the Israeli right and it was Menachem Begin who started the rapprochement with Egypt . #% However , I am not clear whether the Commission has actually put to the Council specific proposals for the expenditure of some of this EUR 1 billion or whether such expenditure has in fact been blocked . #% What national parliaments must improve on doing is to scrutinise and check the executive power of the Council . #% The problem is that the recent invasion of Gaza was totally disproportionate and largely indiscriminate , with casualty rates one hundred times higher amongst innocent Palestinian men , women and children than amongst the Israeli army . #% May they be kept locked up for a suitable period of time to deter them from being so stupid in the future ! #% They see us restricting each other 's liberties . #% After all , we have seen this in the past . #% So much for the rule of law ! #% We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them . #% Secondly , we are concerned in our committee about the internal market and simplifying the regime which allows citizens to go and buy a car from another country and have their existing insurance extended for 30 days while they bring that car home and have it re-registered . #% I do not approve of that treaty or its creations . #% And of course there was a massive loophole in the whole system , a loophole big enough to drive a Rolls Royce through , in that manufacturers could as an alternative pay a 200 euro fine for not complying with the directive . #% Again the EU is taking a lead in improving animal welfare standards . #% It is extremely useful that Mrs Schreyer has been here today . #% However , this report is driven by the idea of extending EU competence and elevating the European Commission to a controlling position in the European armaments industry . #% Certainly we are delighted to see the flexibility that has been introduced for the bond market . #% However , it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either . #% Mr President , if the sitting is supposed to resume at 3 p.m. then would it not be a good idea to start at 3 p.m. and not have lunch until all hours of the afternoon ? #% To do that , however , they need a national insurance number . #% If the US decides in favour of Massachusetts , will the European Union then reintroduce our opposition in the World Trade Organisation to these measures taken in Massachusetts ? #% I am pleased that the Commission recognizes the sagacity of Parliament 's work and accepts 17 out of 20 amendments tabled by Parliament in the first reading and thus avoids the need for conciliation . #% We want to see the suspension of the National Assembly and Senate lifted and urge that the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians be respected . #% Until we know that we can not really make our mind up as to what we should be supporting for next year . #% ACTA , I hope , is an important step in terms of enforcement among all active parties and builds on the TRIPS agreement of the mid-1990s . #% Will he have a look at that , because if we are going to get the research programme right , we need to have research into that research programme , and to listen to the people in the field . #% Good governments make strategic choices . #% The programme as it stands at the moment has been a success . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am very pleased with the question and grateful to Mr Cashman for setting out his views . #% I trust that the approved amendment will be held to when the budget comes out . #% I agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak when she said that no-one knows the real answer . #% The situation in Western Sahara remains one of the final vestiges of decolonisation and , after 30 years , needs to be resolved . #% We hear rumours that a key part of the solution is to make the private sector share the burden of future bail-outs . #% For example , this should be toughened safety glass as it would be in the UK but apparently not in Spain . #% Is this not another example of the European Union standing up for the interests of European consumers over the overwhelming power of monopoly companies ? #% If the fine words and good intentions of the President-in-Office could deliver firm results , the Council would have ensured that changes in its Rules of Procedure were now on the way to being put into practice . #% In other words , the new countries will expect and should obtain funding for their requirements . #% I believe that by passing this resolution , we shall be reaffirming our intentions of carrying on the struggle to achieve that . #% Mr President , as my group 's coordinator in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I would like to welcome the attention given by the Commission to completing the internal market in a number of important areas and to thank the Commissioner and his team for that . #% This really must be sorted out by the Presidency . #% My own government is taking a reckless approach to it . #% These are lovely words , they are good words : they represent a European Union that is not trying to impose its will upon developing nations but is trying to lend a helping hand to achieve common goals . #% I believe that what is now on the table will be welcomed by the people of Cyprus and I hope that they will give a positive vote in the referendum on 24 April . #% I would like to make it clear that I and my family are in no way guilty of colluding with anything that took place in colonial days . #% The European Parliament has been used to by-pass national parliaments which have rejected similar proposals . #% In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle . #% The European Parliament has well-established links with parliaments in many of the countries around the world , the countries with which we are concerned . #% This is not merely a theoretical or academic discussion , but a very real discussion about real countries . #% The common transport policy contributes to increasing the competitiveness and attractiveness of rail transport through various actions including the so-called PACT programme - Project Action for Combined Transport - the removal of technical and regulatory barriers to international freight transport - which is absolutely crucial - the efforts to complete the internal market in rail , which will enhance efficiency and attractiveness , and also other policies like the development of the trans-European networks which , because it is very substantially balanced in favour of rail , can also make its contribution to increasing sustainability of transport . #% We also have to take inspiration from Mr Colom i Naval 's advice and knowledge of this . #% An attack on one country of the EU is an attack on us all . #% This is not Mr Haarder 's fault . #% It has disclosed a large number of technical issues that we had not originally foreseen . #% Fourthly and finally , our leaders need to find the moral courage to shape Europe politically . #% The package that has been agreed in the Constitution is , nonetheless , one that takes the European Union forward in a number of ways as regards democracy , efficiency , transparency and understandability of the Union . #% But we have to say to the Ukrainian authorities that ultimately their fate lies in their own hands , so they must push forward their economic reform which will allow private investment to come in to galvanize their economy . #% Mr McCartin pointed out quite rightly that Mr Helmer had no understanding of history . #% One facet of this is that it would mean that we would have a much more rapid response and it would be a more effective European Union relationship with our NGOs . #% The proposals in the report have the specific aim of subsuming Britain 's distinct and diverse culture into the federalist fairytale creation of a common European culture . #% We are not voting against a Charter itself , but so far the process seems to suggest a wasted opportunity to protect the citizens of Europe from the overburdening powers of the European Institutions . #% 
Turning to the resolution itself we rightly deplore recent events but my feeling is that we should be more welcoming and encouraging concerning the reforms initiated by the Turkish Government . #% The States whose waters they pass through on the way have been consulted and their views taken into account . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether she regards the regulation of nickel-cadmium batteries as more important than the regulation of the Internet , in particular , control of child pornography which is currently accessible on the Internet . #% If the European Union is to increase transparency , we need to take action and not just mouth platitudes on the subject . #% We asked for codecision for the European Parliament for any future steps to full liberalisation . #% I have a constituent - and I have brought this to the attention of the Commissioner - against whom proceedings were brought in the civil courts in the UK and whose case was thrown out by the English High Court . #% Personally , I oppose any funding of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority Government unless it renounces violence , disarms and recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist . #% Of course the future of the EU is a very important subject : the kind of Europe we want to live in is important for our countries and peoples . #% I call on Mr Newton Dunn to resign . #% Mr President , it is my pleasure and honour to speak today on behalf of the Socialist Group on this important subject . #% Mr President , subject to a few amendments , my Group fully supports the motion for a resolution put before us and so ably drafted by the rapporteurs , Mr Tsatsos and Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado . #% We are not exporting poor animal welfare provisions , rather raising standards for both poultry and people . #% It fits squarely within the approach outlined by the UK Secretary of State this morning in that the biggest stimulus to achieving quality of aid , to which she pledges herself , is the participation by recipients themselves in the planning , implementation and evaluation of development projects with which we seek to benefit them . #% I am not criticising Germany or France . #% It would be a great service to parliamentary democracy . #% So I congratulate the rapporteur and the Belgian and Spanish presidencies for brokering the agreement . #% However , we do oppose this legislation being made at EU level . #% With over 60 million jobs in the EU generated by industrial manufacturing , a robust policy will help the EU overcome some of the challenges faced by manufacturers . #% However , it is all too often very poorly paid , it is often done by women , by migrant women , and the staff are often recruited with difficulty . #% It is therefore crucial that we use these powers to improve the position of victims of crime . #% With respect , the confusion has arisen not least owing to the services , which have put it all on the same line : recital A , oral amendment from the PPE-DE Group , and the amendment from the UEN Group , about which Mr Schulz spoke . #% My group also shares those concerns and therefore we support what Mr Stenmarck has put in his report , namely that we would like the relevant committee to have a report on this proposed recruitment office before a final decision is taken . #% We plan to have a meeting of national parliaments and national parliamentarians to discuss this proposal . #% As the President-in-Office has said , the HIPC initiative is yielding very slow results and coming in too late . #% Various experiences and various construction projects utilising cement that has been ameliorated with ferrous sulphate have demonstrated that the sensible use of this cement makes a very substantial reduction in the number of incidents of eczema within the industry . #% The Charter carries great authority and legitimacy . #% Parliament will bring wisdom and commitment to the process and focus upon common European solutions . #% It is not an attack on the Commission per se - let us get that straight . #% The taxpayers of Britain , realising all of this , seeing your direct tax , will simply conclude that we can not afford the European Union . #% The rapporteur in this report mentioned naming and shaming and on the basis of the evidence available , this is a situation of sufficient seriousness to merit a considered reply from the Commission . #% I wish to say one or two words about the amendments tabled . #% in writing . - Health service structures vary greatly across the EU , and I support this directive that outlines a coherent approach to funding cross-border healthcare . #% This means measures fail totally to tackle the whole question of animal suffering . #% This figure could and should be much higher and it is the duty of all responsible Members of this House to raise awareness of this necessary project . #% I hope that all this will mean that the days of commercial cancellations and lengthy delays will be over . #% We very much support the resolution demanding the establishment of detention conditions that conform with international standards . #% EU exporters of consumer goods , electronics , pharmaceuticals , chemicals and medical devices are just some of the sectors which will benefit immensely from the removal of non-tariff barriers . #% Madam President , I have a point of order concerning the death penalty in the United States . #% Mr President , despite the fact that a large proportion of the population of Nicaragua is desperately poor , Nicaragua has the highest debt per head in the world . #% This is sadly lacking at the moment . #% This is an extremely important time for the European Union . #% It is largely on the capacity issue that I part company with a number of my fellow committee members . #% The European people have the final say . #% Once we know the Council 's intentions , then we can make some decision as to what to do ourselves . #% We need a social protection system that recognizes that many people , especially women , face poverty after retirement because they have not had the opportunity to build up occupational pensions and a social protection system that values the children of Europe and is concerned that too many of them , for example one in three in the United Kingdom , are still growing up in households which are below the poverty line . #% In the end we have to recognize that we must solve our fishing problems ourselves and not simply export them . #% Can I ask you whether you still genuinely believe that the current rules are sufficient ? #% I fear that if meat potentially contaminated with low pathogenic avian influenza were to reach the food chain , it would damage consumer confidence in poultry meat and products in general . #% There is a danger that , whilst we all talk about reducing burdens on business , we constantly vote here for specific items doing the opposite , so all the institutions of the European Union , including our own , must play their part . #% You recognise what is going on in the world , but you are battling against the revived economic nationalism that exists within this European Union . #% Throughout the European Union this must leave no doubt in anybody 's mind that we have an ageing society , one that will gradually cost more and must be adequately provided for so as to avoid future pensioner poverty , a very real risk . #% So why are we ploughing on with a strategy that is already being undermined by the practicalities ? #% We need to get to the truth of what happened and why thousands were ruined . #% I just have certain worries about the automatic stays and suspect that we might need some fine-tuning at a later stage . #% Companies have to produce goods that customers can afford to buy , at a profit , otherwise they can not continue to employ people . #% It is interesting to note that they were the only people who were asked whether or not they wanted the Treaty . #% Madam President , shortly after I was first elected to Parliament in 1989 , I was asked to take part in a parliamentary delegation to observe the first ever democratic elections in Chile following the Pinochet dictatorship . #% It is important and good that we have gathered together so many excellent rapporteurs . #% As much as I support Ukraine 's EU aspirations , we have not carried Europe 's public with us on enlargement . #% We will see , but that is what he predicted . #% Kick us out ! #% One can always say it is never enough but do you seriously think you have any indications that this is going to attract more people into the scheme than before ? #% However , this time the needs in category 4 - especially in the areas of Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund - have to be sorted out . #% Nevertheless , I welcome the recent thaw in relations . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , our colleague , Mr Coelho , has yet again justified his middle name : Carlos ` Schengen ' Coelho . #% There is no point in having conciliation meetings if that is the level we are going to reach . #% 
Even on the issue of gas supply , much of the answer lies close to home . #% In the context of the current budget process , we must reassess the EU 's vast aid programme , in particular , if states were involved in that terrorism in any way . #% Let us remind ourselves of what those wrongs are . #% Whilst drawing up the second liberalisation package in 1989 , the Council and the Commission agreed that Community air transport policy had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation . #% I trust that Member States in particular will take note that the problem of adequate and sustainable pensions is a problem today , will be an even bigger problem tomorrow , and requires action now . #% Let me conclude by saying that yesterday the UK Government published Think small first , a document about ensuring that every department of government thinks about small businesses , not just about the availability of finance that we are discussing in this debate but about the overall macroeconomic framework and the sorts of advice and skills that they need to support them and become prosperous . #% Europe 's national governments have no coherence or agreement when it comes to military operations . #% Let us hope that the last chance saloon at the forthcoming Brussels Summit will demonstrate that my disappointment with the British Presidency is actually misplaced . #% We do not have just a humane interest in the security and stability of Russia and her increasingly important southern reaches , but a selfish interest as well . #% Clearly today it has been Sweden 's day . #% Rather like the Irish population when they run a referendum , you can never rely on it to behave . #% Those are the areas we have to focus on . #% . Mr President , is there anything the EU does not seek to control ? #% We can only benefit from facilitating closer business ties with Taiwan , whose economy is growing again and going from strength to strength , and is increasingly a springboard for European investments into China . #% The document is also strong on governance and the rule of law , which are very important aspects of our work with developing countries . #% Mr Nisticò and Mr Nobilia raised this earlier on . #% We have received back around GBP 105 billion by way of subsidies of one form or another . #% Some chance , I would suggest ! #% The asylum system is based on urgently needing protection . #% But a tribunal which will also act as an inhibition to practitioners of evil , whether they manifest themselves in Indo-China or in former Yugoslavia . #% We must distinguish between makeup and cosmetics that have a medicinal purpose . #% Mr President , I am now putting on a different hat to present my report to Parliament . #% in writing . - It is important in this time of financial and economic crisis that we maintain and strengthen workers ' rights to ensure that the costs of the crisis do not fall on those least able to bear it . #% The most important challenge in Kosovo is the massive unemployment . #% The directive represents a delicate balance between granting a patent and respect for animal welfare and dignity of humans . #% These 300 items are currently legally and safely on sale in the shops of my country and yours , Commissioner . #% Britain 's extradition arrangements under the European Arrest Warrant and under the similar and non-reciprocal arrangement with the USA amount to little better than the judicial kidnap of British citizens . #% To name just two examples : land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare . #% I should just like to highlight two of the important points that he made . #% Turning to the issue of fishmeal , maybe I am a bit emotional , but I tend to agree with those who say that we should not go back to feeding animal protein to ruminants . #% So , I am afraid he would be a flawed Commissioner , Mr Prodi . #% I would like to support the suggestion that this full debate takes place in the presence of Commissioner Byrne . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply . #% The Commission commented in its communication to this Parliament that it could not accept this because , in its words , it would render the further operation of the ferry or craft ` economically non-viable ' . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , to the disadvantage of the United Kingdom , the UK Government has implemented the EU rail package . #% Thirdly , we are trying to provide greater legal certainty for employers . #% In my own country , my party is famed for its spin-doctors . #% For example , the inclusion of an end date of 2012 will result in old plants being run harder to use up the time remaining and will increase pollution during those four years . #% Nothing is more important among all the Finnish pledges than their pledge to take up the cause of people and their families who suffer not just an illness or a disability but disadvantage and stigma too . #% As Mr Howitt said , the election agents were well trained and confident about what they were doing and showed great dedication . #% The resolution we are voting on not only deals with the approval of the election itself , but also the follow-up we expect the various organisations and institutions to take . #% It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games . #% As reflected in the conclusions reached at its meeting yesterday , the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomes the cooperation with the Parliament in developing and delivering its human rights policy during 2005 and looks forward to building on that relationship further . #% I congratulate the Commission and I urge it to persuade other donors to adopt the same approach as our team in Brussels and on the ground . #% However , in the light of the South African negotiating team 's willingness now to put forward a new - and significantly improved - offer of possibly 85 % product coverage , does the Council anticipate that there will be commensurate adjustments coming from the Commission in the negotiations on our side ? #% That means that we must have a proper enforceable peace . #% We strongly believe that women as well as men have an important role to play in achieving the economic goals of the Lisbon strategy which must be to secure long-term economic growth and high employment levels . #% In my committee , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , we are determined to take our responsibilities as MEPs very seriously indeed . #% When will some serious pressure be exerted to actually deliver on that year-old pledge ? #% Far from it , although I would ask them why this is inevitably linked with numbering . #% There are many computer scientists struggling with totally inadequate facilities who would really like to be on our research networks and working with our research scientists . #% Mr President , the stated EU position and that of my party is to support Turkish EU membership . #% We must learn from them . #% Today , we reaffirm this House 's role as a defender of human rights with a long history of opposition to the death penalty . #% The budget votes will be in October and will be in Strasbourg . #% It also confuses asylum with immigration . #% People fought and died so that we could be an independent self-governing democratic nation that was able to hire and fire its leaders . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , we are in the presence of a great man today - the President of Europe . #% We recognize in the European Union , as the Commission well knows , that in our dealings with third countries we should work for the promotion of democracy and human rights . #% I am very grateful for the work she has done . #% In the last two years since Tampere , the programme of cooperation on justice matters has been heavily weighted to the security side of the scales - especially since 11 September with the anti-terrorism package . #% This is confirmed in the explicit reference to establishing a European core of civilian and military units responsible for ` keeping and restoring peace ' . #% I also see that we have now proceeded from ` moving up a gear ' to ` boosting trust through action ' . #% Forty years later Spinelli was here helping Parliament to produce its draft Treaty on European Union . #% There should be no fundamental problem with the Commission delegation signing contracts -- why should that be a problem , because that would certainly speed up the process ? #% Can you give some guidance to members on the implications for tonight 's session . #% 
Now we look ahead . #% This directive , as a number of colleagues have said , has a very slow-burning fuse to it . #% We can only object and if we do object , that would hold up agreement . #% If I am asked to give an example of the way in which the principles of sustainable development can be put into practice , then this directive may well be it . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for a helpful and very informative reply . #% First , the new accountancy systems put in place in January 2005 must be monitored closely to ensure that they will deliver world class standards of accounts . #% What a clear majority of our political group would like to ask is whether the Commission can justify under what grounds Mrs Andreassen was gagged from giving us technical information about a substantive item which we need to know about . #% My colleague , Anna Terrón , has said that this report is naïve . #% We should salute it - and I think we do . #% Hence the problem : because non-EU countries , especially Latin America , now want parity . #% One of the issues is the length of detention . #% You have guessed that I am speaking about Sharia law . #% How can her stance on this directive , and its practical application among businesses that employ temporary workers , in any way be squared with the target to reduce unemployment across the European Union ? #% The recommendation on child care , suggests that action should be taken to provide child care for parents in employment or training , to make the workplace more responsive to the needs of workers with children and to involve men more as carers . #% To paraphrase Sir Con : ` These two events are not unconnected ' . #% But we think there should be an enquiry into the management of foot-and-mouth by the Commission and the British authorities , and we will be pushing for that . #% The final results and publications of the risk assessments of certain of these substances are still awaited . #% We were according equal rights to Euro-parliamentarians by arresting them along with all the others . #% This is not the case at all , as I know because I come from a country which is frequently criticized for its attitude towards the Social Chapter , but which has in reality much stricter health and safety conditions than other Member States . #% Public opinion supports the EU as a global actor . #% I would not , if I were you , be too complacent about the summit you had in Lisbon last week either because , for once , the national parliaments will have their say . #% Or , how do you safely smash and dispose of 83 million eggs every day ? #% That is what this text says . #% That is a dilemma for us . #% Its ambition to join the European Union by 2007 is realistic and we should say so . #% In fact , all centralised EU plans fail . #% We will be determined to do our best for the Balkans and Kosovo but , at the same time , we will be realistic for those other policies which Parliament considers to be important . #% The security implications of a collapse of the Pakistan State would be devastating to the security of the entire developed world . #% I do not think it should be withdrawn , I think it should be suspended . #% Last year I visited Egypt , Algeria , Yemen and Syria , following the path of Arab reform . #% That is very good news , which I wanted to pass on to colleagues this morning . #% We have to stop letting the Court make the rules about healthcare ; the legislators have to make the healthcare rules . #% Secondly , if we are serious about exports we should also pay some attention to renewable energy sources in which we in the European Union have a technological lead , which is not necessarily the case here . #% It is our long-standing policy not to take a position on issues which do not affect the United Kingdom and from which we have secured an opt-out . #% The committee was unable to support a call now for the publication of votes as is in the Liberal group amendment today . #% Its stress on coherent development and integration is essential and is exemplified by my concluding plea for support tonight . #% Thirdly , does he accept that unless we can get the civilian aspects of Dayton up and running , we will end up with another Cyprus where we have a permanent military presence in a divided country ? #% Learn that lesson and you might start winning hearts and minds . #% We know from the South American experience that once that happens you begin to completely lose control of a political situation . #% I do not know about you , but its seems to me that this evening is rather reminiscent of the Titanic . #% We want reasonable Kurdish concerns to be resolved in a just and fair way through negotiation . #% I have seen a lot of rapporteurs and he really has done a very good job . #% They are right . #% There needs to be a health briefing in the same form as the current safety briefing on board , including advice on the preventative measures that can be taken . #% The conclusion must therefore be that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in the Iranian Republic . #% Anybody who thinks that these Stage II tests are a pushover , or are easily attainable with current technology , needs to take a serious look at what is going on in the industry and not sit in this House drawing up unrealistic amendments . #% However , we must not allow the world to forget the crimes that are being committed in Gaza , which has effectively been turned into a prison for Palestinians . #% On that occasion in September I expressed my concern , as did other Members , at the spiralling cost of the project . #% Madam President , it is probably appropriate today that we have a group of visitors in the gallery from the lovely country of Scotland , which is our key forestry area in the United Kingdom . #% Mr President , the contribution made by the European Union through the San José dialogue to ending the horrific civil wars in Nicaragua , El Salvador and , more recently , Guatemala is very considerable and demonstrates quite clearly the positive role that the European Union can play on the world scene . #% How serious does it have to get before effective action is taken ? #% I am also worried that the obsession with reducing costs is forcing pilots to work longer and longer hours . #% We have a single market but it is still fragmented . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , recent scandals have certainly exposed the power that lobbyists can have upon Parliament , so the Liberal Group strongly welcomes the streamlining of the lobbyists ' register , which creates effectively a straightforward mandatory system which ought to bring greater transparency and improved consultative processes . #% I would ask the Commission to listen to the concerns of Parliament and industry and let us have a new directive , then we can report on it , give our response and pass it through Parliament quickly . #% Lastly , I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU 's political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario . #% Wiser counsels know this is impossible . #% Tibetans were forced to comply with foreign regulations aimed at changing their traditions and eliminating their country . #% It is a situation at the moment where there are currently more than eighty actions pending before the Court of Justice against eleven Member States for infringement of European Union environmental legislation . #% People who say a facilitator provided by the EU , the Commonwealth or the UN is no way forward are not offering any alternative . #% That is why the argument about the British rebate is about politics and not proper financial management . #% in writing . - The British Conservative delegation supported this report because it recognised that under the ` Amsterdam Protocol ' , it is the exclusive competence of Member States to define the public service remit and to provide funding of public sector broadcasters . #% We should be asking Eurostat and the Commission if they could sort it out , to give us the information we want so that we can try and get better value for this money . #% But criticism is easy ; what is being attempted has never been done before . #% In the last few days many groups have been kind enough to invite me to address their meetings and to engage in building this consensus . #% We urgently need a proper legal base for the civil dialogue . #% 
I can only assume that , for reasons unknown to me , the Commission finds it embarrassing to answer this question . #% Under Rule 191 ( 8 ) , relating to the Committee on Petitions , of which I am a member , a petitioner to the Parliament can insist on anonymity . #% The granting of asylum is a precious gift not to be abused , as is unfortunately the case too often . #% Enforcement is problematic to say the least and , as in so many aspects of fishing , varies from one Member State to another . #% The emphasis should be on decentralised production using low-cost , sustainable farming methods . #% The best way for companies to be successful is for them to be competitive in the global market . #% The European Parliament has taken a very reasonable approach to this matter . #% We are encouraging people to live in other countries , to embrace other cultures ; yet when they die , suddenly , the border is erected and the bureaucracy comes into play . #% I find myself in the extraordinary position today of supporting a Labour Government , a Labour Prime Minister and a Labour leader of the delegation here in this Parliament in the words that they say and in the actions that they propose . #% Applying this logic in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I am questioning the efficiency of the four agencies which we have been discussing : Eurofund , ETF , OSHA and the improbably named Cedefop . #% There is widespread concern about industrial fishing for fishmeal , scooping out immature fish from the sea and damaging the possibilities for regeneration of the stock . #% We granted self-determination to all our colonies where it was legally possible to do so . #% The report does not seek to sensationalise or exaggerate perceived dangers , but it does provide a useful framework to encourage public awareness of the risks involved and to provide practical remedies . #% Mr President , could I ask the Commissioner whether he considers that this evaluation risks putting structures in place which actually endanger the possibility of us of being able to react in a crisis as quickly and as effectively as he suggests we should ? secondly , Commissioner , let us take for instance a case study such as Sierra Leone : You talked about the clear distinction between humanitarian aid and long-term assistance . #% However , it is important that we retain a sense of proportion about this matter . #% Further observers offering technical assistance will come from other states . #% Returning to the EPA negotiations , we should use the Doha Declaration on TRIPS as a ceiling for any discussion with the ACP on intellectual property . #% Worse than that , it is ignoring the budgetary authority , which it should do its best to respect . #% One actually wonders whether these late-night sessions put our European taxpayers ' money to good use . #% It is unacceptable to the peoples of Europe to see every day on their television scenes of atrocities and massacres ; to see the problems of refugees ; to see the destabilisation of a region of Europe as more and more refugees go into Albania and put more pressure on FYROM , so that the whole region could explode ; and to see the European Union , the Council of Ministers , simply not prepared to do anything . #% Is there somebody in charge ? #% Mr President , I would like colleagues to focus on what we do now and next week . #% Even if we get Europeans back from Guantanamo Bay , we must speak up for the rest of the 650 detainees . #% We have been very clear . #% It is a tribute to the Convention process that it stands up to such critical assessment , especially from this House , which is not known for complacency when it comes to these questions . #% As the noted children 's author J.K. Rowling said recently , ` When you look at how far Romania has come , it is hard not to concede that a minor miracle has been achieved ' . #% In my constituency in Fowey in the Camel Valley we have excellent wines which are still not able to have those designations . #% In this I refer particularly to the need to share information on best practices - we have to be prepared to address common and specific problems transparently and honestly - and to the recent judgments in the European Court of Justice regarding cross-border access to medical products . #% We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour . #% For this reason , the British Conservative delegation voted against this report . #% I welcome the question , but what I would welcome even more is a promise of clear legislative action . #% I particularly oppose the allocation of funds for the brainwashing of young people , referred to in this report as being used for advancing the idea of Europe . #% In particular , we recognise that attacks on civilians either by states or by organisations are entirely unacceptable . #% We will seek to take out the bureaucratic limitation that direct marketing e-mails can only be for products similar to those previously bought . #% The problem I am seeking to address in this question is that concentration of media ownership sometimes causes problems with freedom of the press , particularly when that concentration of ownership stretches beyond just ownership of newspapers and into other economic fields . #% That is why there is a motion for a resolution attached to give power to the President of Parliament to instruct the Committee on Legal Affairs to take legal action against the Commission to answer that question , if -- as I suspect is already the case this evening -- this has not happened . #% The way to keep Bosnia and Albania up to the mark would be to include them in the legal scope of this proposed regulation , but to make the actual implementation of visa waiver conditional on a Commission declaration of compliance - in fact , similar to that which the Commission needs to make this autumn about Serbia and Montenegro . #% Second , we need to understand fully the impact on the flow of arms if the embargo is lifted . #% When the regulation enters into force , the citizen 's right of access to institution documents will no longer be a discretionary concession but a fundamental right , rooted in Article 255 . #% I can assure him that it is a shared interest . #% Advertising : good quality programmes have to be paid for . #% Producers of particular high-quality , regional specialities need guarantees that their products are not being copied and then marketed either at premium or cut prices as though they were the genuine article . #% I want to draw attention to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe . #% However , we have some serious concerns , more specifically with regard to paragraph 1 , paragraph 5 , indent 5 , and recital E. Meeting these concerns is crucial to our decision on the final vote . #% I believe we should open a Commission office in Tehran as soon as possible . #% At the same time , there has been no let-up in policies which have led to other violations of human and women 's rights by the regime and the case of Morteza Firouzi is referred to in our resolution today . #% I am grateful , as ever , to Mr Harbour for illuminating questions . #% In view of the position of my political group in this matter , I feel unable to oppose the resolution outright , and I shall therefore abstain . #% That being the case , it was not within the remit of the committee to enquire any further , and the committee made its decision on that basis . #% I would like to thank him for his work and , in particular , for his efforts to get a compromise solution that is acceptable to us all . #% I have agreed to remove such references from my resolution for the sake of consistency with the approach adopted in the other enlargement reports . #% In Amendment No 15 we propose that the reference period for calculating the average 48-hour week be limited to arrangements set in place as a result of collective agreements . #% Mrs Breyer referred to shrimps being taken from one market to another , peeled in one continent and brought back to another . #% Let us not be beguiled by arguments about harmonising taxation , because harmonised taxes under socialists have only one way to go and that is up . #% This implies clear lines of approach for all democratic representative bodies , especially regional authorities with parliamentary powers of law-making independent of their Member States . #% Imagine what British troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it . #% In seven years ' time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress . #% It is for these reasons that British Conservatives have voted against the Malmström resolution . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , Mr Barroso said this morning that all Member States had democratically ratified this Treaty . #% We are seeking to implement best practice . #% The countries concerned - as Commissioner Malmström said - have responsibilities and they must be reminded of them . #% Of course , we also condemn the murderous and brutal activities of the guerrillas , but two-thirds of the human rights abuses are perpetrated by the Colombian military or their paramilitary allies , which Uribe is now cynically seeking to legalise . #% Madam President , is not the real reason for this glossy brochure and this debate today the fact that the Treaty of Nice is dead ? #% By punishing private equity funds , it will cause a loss of investment in the UK and Europe at a time that greater investment is needed to remain competitive in a globalised economy . #% The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already , not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there , but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population . #% A collapse in the credibility of or belief that the Bank would not be prepared to pursue an anti-inflationary policy at all costs could have severe repercussions economically throughout the whole Union . #% 
Mr President , I also wish to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council . #% We have established a self-evolving text which , I am sure , will be improved upon in the course of time . #% It then goes straight into processed food , so that when we go to buy our chicken sandwich at a motorway service station , it will probably be made from imported chicken meat and we have no idea what sort of standards it has met . #% It is for this reason that the jurisdictional aspects and arguments must be squeezed out of disputes . #% In the United Kingdom , the single biggest cause of consumer debt is the arrival of a sudden , enormous utility bill on the doorstep . #% Peace will not come from resolutions adopted here - although we can help . #% I have to ask the limited number of people here how we are going to create jobs and growth in the European economy if we can not get the internal market to work properly ; if we can not engage all the tools and weapons at our disposal . #% I am sure her heart is in the right place , but it is high time that we had a code of administrative behaviour that was binding on the institutions , not voluntary , and a code that was uniform across each of the institutions . #% I therefore hope the Council will be able , after this debate , to reach a speedy agreement . #% You will have Members who wish neither to vote in favour of a text or against a text , but who wish to indicate their presence in the Chamber by pressing the button of abstention . #% It is right that Europe should be legislating to guarantee the fundamental right to dignity , irrespective of ethnicity , and not to suffer discrimination . #% Single parent families represent one form and raise the entire range of equal opportunities issues . #% I endorse what Mr Di Lello Finuoli said : the real issue is not whether people are married or with whom they are in a lasting relationship . #% We , the countries of the European Union , have accepted the challenge to help the least - and the less-developed countries to overcome poverty and to become partners with us in world trade and development . #% And those who promote abstinence ? #% Lastly , I would suggest that perhaps the two organisations - the Council of Europe and the OSCE - consider amalgamation . #% It means partnership at all levels to tackle the greatest public needs and health inequalities most effectively , not least in the current process of enlargement of the Union , where a much-needed further Commission text is imminent . #% In terms of the particular instrument that we are looking at today , as Mr Barón Crespo says , there has to be greater clarity about how this money is spent and how the committees administering this money are set up . #% I am deeply saddened . #% Perhaps if I try to go through the more salient points made and simply make the most brief answers that will assist the House , especially against the background of the fact that in their post today and probably in their offices already , there is a very comprehensive lengthy reply to every aspect of the oral question set down by Mr Harbour and Madam Guy-Quint and secondly a very full table of 23 pages going through each of the 98 actions for reform proposals and giving a detailed account of the state of play on each of those at the moment , whether those proposals have been completed and implemented , which several have , or whether they are currently the subject of consultation or whether they have been presented to this House , or to the Council , or both , for the legislative amendment required to put them into effect . #% My wish to be rapporteur for this report stems partly from my commitment to combating racism . #% Yet we have had no debate in this House to know how we are going to handle not a limited enlargement but an extensive enlargement following the Helsinki Summit late last year , with potentially 12 or 13 new countries , that is 27 - 28 countries with over 20 different languages . #% What I would like the Commissioner to go through just one more time again here now for total clarity is his belief that this delay will only be a few days and that at the very latest he envisages this process being completed by the Tuesday of the Strasbourg session , and preferably before . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , PNR is , as has been acknowledged , an important tool for national security . #% I formed the view , personally , that in many ways the elections were superior in design to those in my own country , the United Kingdom . #% I am told I do not like football : I am a Manchester City season-ticket holder . #% We must not leave that out of the equation when we look at the rights of minorities . #% However , whilst I was saddened to see the deal voted down , I was not altogether surprised . #% Against such a backdrop we can begin to persuade the WTO that these issues are humanitarian , not protectionist . #% At the same time , we must aid and support those African states which take similar punitive actions against the Mugabe regime . #% We must condemn all attempts to stamp out free speech and media freedom and we must stand in solidarity with the entire legal profession of Pakistan when we deplore the suspension of Chief Justice Chaudhry . #% Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available . #% We wish to add the following text : ` ... and questions the need for defiling the office of the Prime Minister to be a criminal offence ' . #% I agree with what you said in your introduction but let us see those principles applied in Europe as well as in other countries of the world . #% Small arms , in the wrong hands , prolong and exacerbate some of the world 's most brutal conflicts . #% It is estimated that 197 000 people are seeking refuge in the inhospitable deserts of Chad , which we visited last December . #% Mr President , it is right that this Parliament and indeed the Council and the Commission treat this matter with the utmost seriousness . #% Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream . #% We are talking about textiles today , but tomorrow it will be footwear , the day after that it will be bicycles , and then automobiles , machine components or high-tech goods . #% By derogation from that , under Rule 61 , we can deal with a proposal from a Member State government as well . #% We would endanger the SADC HIV/Aids Programme , regarded by all as being one of the most efficient the European Union operates . #% The more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes . #% You treated the French and Dutch referendums with contempt and you refused to take no for an answer . #% I will be very brief but I rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most Members here . #% No-one should underestimate the significance of this initiative , at a time when despite the terrible violence on both sides , a rare opportunity for moving forward has now finally presented itself . #% Firstly , there have been profound delays in the implementation of SAPARD . #% People throughout the Middle East are looking to Europe to come forward and help them to gain their rights , and all you have for them is empty words . #% My plea to the Commissioner is to draw out the excellent words of that and put them into practice . #% in writing . - The ECR Group is a staunch supporter of human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% Afghanistan is a common global problem . #% This , in my view , is yet another example of the nanny super-state , where Brussels supposedly knows best . #% Hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing , raping , and even killing , local residents . #% We are , in short , agreeing with the rapporteur . #% On the contrary , women can spearhead the campaign for equality in human rights for all through the Fundamental Rights Agency . #% I turn now to the points quite rightly raised by my shadow rapporteur , Mrs McCarthy , on the question of ` must carry ' obligations . #% Secondly , we are in danger of seeing an unravelling of the security side of our relationship , where a political consensus underlying NATO can not now be taken for granted for out-of-area responsibilities . #% President-in-Office , what action do you personally feel would be a good idea for either the Irish presidency or any future presidencies to take ? #% Why should the least well off , the workers , be carrying the cost of this recession and the need to repair it ? #% We equally do not accept the inclusion of nuclear energy as part of the Kyoto strategy . #% Whilst I respect the commitment of the rapporteur to his cause , I suggest to the House that is nonsense . #% Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it . #% If we have technologies that will reduce collision speeds by sensing impending impacts , or even alter the direction of the impact , it will make a very substantial improvement . #% I got the impression from your address , Commissioner -- which I thought was quite frank -- that , to choose my words carefully -- and I could have used stronger words -- you were pretty fed up with the way the US was involved in the negotiations . #% Its communication and then the programme for action are very welcome . #% That business now has branches in Hong Kong , Jersey , the Channel Islands and South Africa , as well as London and York , which is my constituency . #% That is crude protectionism and seeks to preserve the EU fruit and vegetable market as a cocooned environment , controlled by suffocating bureaucracy which outside competition must never be allowed to penetrate . #% 
Can we assume that will not be challenged before we take our vote tomorrow morning ? #% The report welcomes and expresses support for the state aid register , which the British Conservatives have made a priority . #% Like Mrs Thors , I was for a time the Chair of the Consumer Protection Intergroup . #% Yes , of course , we need to stand up for all the oppressed groups , but where is the rapporteur 's sense of proportion ? #% You went on to say , and I quote , ` the current rules of access allow the European Parliament to fully exercise its task of political control ' . #% They have for a number of reasons declined these changes . #% Where would that leave the candidate countries like Poland and Hungary , whose government leaders have already expressed concern over the timetable ? #% Too many cosy deals were done with other people 's money and people were prepared to turn a blind eye to the weaknesses of those deals . #% At the end there is a complicated appendix which seeks to lay down the law on the specifications for codends and even the exact size and shape of codend buoys . #% What we have been hearing over the last few weeks and today sounds to us simply like moving the walls of fortress Europe and looking for stronger building materials , including using the idea of economic clout - such as development aid - in our attempts to have other countries police their borders more effectively to stop people leaving . #% Of course it rightly expresses some criticisms : it highlights shortcomings in the Constitution . #% The issue we have before us arises because the Treaties themselves are not clear on what should happen if Parliament does not give discharge . #% These developments are to be deplored . #% One of the core areas proposed in this report is to ensure that we use the research network that the Commission is already funding - the Géant network - to use that effectively by supporting projects that will exploit that very high carrying-capacity research network in anticipation of the whole infrastructure evolution that in future will be driven by the market place . #% Unfortunately , 1 000 are fatal . #% This is not within my portfolio but I am told it was not intentional , and would not want it to lead to any deterioration in the essential cooperation between our institutions . #% I call upon the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to make that point . #% In this respect , China and Russia , for once , have a common agenda with the West in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region , which will quickly spread to the South Korean part of the peninsula and to Japan , with very dangerous consequences for the whole world . #% Meanwhile , this Parliament continues farcically pushing through vote after vote on dubious shows of hands . #% My whole experience of small businesses tells me that SMEs feel squeezed out by big-business representatives . #% Fine - the UK has already signed these - but the EU wants to add its own fleet database , to which I and others would object . #% We were better off with the last Commission as regards the way in which the programme is presented . #% Last week in Taba innocent Israeli holidaymakers were killed by a bomb attack which has all the hallmarks of al-Qa ' ida . #% We believe that the labelling provisions currently buried in myriad different directives need to be drawn out and brought together if we are to have a proper and effective control of this area . #% If you have all of us with you , you will be better off than if we have interinstitutional wars , which you seem to have started this morning . #% Commissioner De Silguy 's recent ASEAN visit highlights these exciting developments . #% I wrote to the Commissioner in June prior to the Shanghai Agreement , asking him how his proposals would square the circle of the seemingly insatiable demand for Chinese textiles in Europe . #% It is extremely embarrassing to have to admit to the public at home just how slow progress has been where both statutes are concerned . #% The European Parliament is prepared to bring other elected representatives - ministers of Member States - to account and demand their presence here to explain the failure to implement legislation . #% Madam Commissioner : the PPE-DE broadly supports the Galileo project in principle . #% Together , the EU and US are a formidable team . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I wish to say that we believe the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential pillar of economic stability in the euro area and in the Union more widely , and should be respected in letter and spirit . #% In my region , the East Midlands of the United Kingdom , in the last election voters experimented and tried a different colour . #% I challenge the groups when they draw up their voting list to look beyond short-term electoral gain and to vote in such a way as to support and improve implementation of the Commission 's reform proposals rather than undermine them . #% If you had trouble getting on a higher education course in Austria for example , because you were of a certain race , this place would have been in a complete uproar . #% By banning organisations like the Kurdish PKK and Batasuna they remove political outlets for dissent as an alternative to terrorism . #% The forthcoming election provides the opportunity for a change , and it is very important that we should give every support to those people in Indonesia who are trying to achieve a new departure . #% But we hope too that the Romanian Government will give greater prominence to the needs to the lower strata of society in Romania . #% The EPLP supported those amendments which would help to get rid of the barbaric practice of shark finning . #% The rapporteur tells us that we must help Delhi fight against poverty , but would he just tell his own organisation what it is doing to help ? #% This is a report that originated with the Commission proposal in November 1997 which the last Parliament considered at first reading , in the Robles Piquer report , in February . #% Turning to the problem of drugs -- and this is a problem because , in British terms , where you live can affect what you get -- we can produce the information but we can not direct people how to spend their medical resources , and I am pleased to say that this report does not say that . #% I reflected that the equipment was supplied by a nationalized company in a country which still has to address the imbalance of an economy where too much is in the public sector and protected from the pressures of competition . #% When it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation , there was a lot of concern , particularly in the UK , that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I think we should start off by welcoming some of these statements that were made this evening and the fact that , following the Tokyo Round , the Commission released the text to the Parliament , which will ultimately be in a position to give consent or not to these agreements . #% I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests . #% Perhaps it sees an opportunity to export some of its unemployed and criminals to Britain . #% It should not be hostage to Burma , but that is what the ASEAN states are allowing to happen . #% She was not acting it , she was not pretending it - nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun . #% For us it represents an important step in recognition of the role and legitimate rights of citizens who file a complaint with the Commission . #% I hope the Commission will bear in mind that Parliament is remarkably united on this dossier . #% Where we could explore a useful way of linking the European elections to the idea of choice for citizens , is by taking up the idea that our rapporteur made just a few minutes ago , namely that each European political party should name its candidate for President of the Commission . #% Mr President , with 80 million new guns manufactured each year , and one person killed by a gun every minute , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons fuels conflict , crime and terrorism across the globe . #% Although those are key points , crucial points , we believe that it is right that the IGC ranges beyond just those three issues . #% There have been concerns about some of the decisions taken in the Hong Kong courts , which Mr Cushnahan describes in detail in his report . #% And yet here we have a US Senate , a legislature , which wishes to resist the global environment in which it lives . #% But at first reading , Parliament supported proposals based on a Commission model which I find fiendishly complicated . #% Increased female participation rates and an ageing population with longer life expectancy increase the demand for household and caring services . #% As a consequence of that evaluation , it is possible that the Commission , on its own initiative , will be able to make recommendations to the individual Member States as to how they have met the challenges of the guidelines . #% However , I do not believe it is necessary to have an energy chapter in the Treaty , nor to impose punitive taxation in order to impose an improved efficiency . #% The same applies , presumably , to Estonia and Lithuania . #% It would be helpful in future years if we could have the broad economic guidelines a bit earlier , because the trouble this time is that we have had to rush to conclusions because of the deadline at the end of this week of the 21 and 22 June meeting in Florence . #% I do not believe that the EU has any business in involving itself in conservation in the Baltic , or anywhere else for that matter . #% There are over one million of us in Britain : we are conservation-minded ; we are sensible . #% Once legislation has been passed , it has to be implemented equally , as we have all been saying , across all Member States . #% My vote in favour of the Construction Products Regulation reflects the need for a modernised , safe and transparent directive on construction products . #% 
Will the Commission not admit to the embarrassment that is caused by the Commission on the one hand saying it wants to develop a directive on late payment while it is frequently guilty of leaving companies waiting for a long time for money ? #% There is nothing nice about misleading people . #% Those three principal objectives were in the original proposal that came from the Commission to Parliament on first reading and has subsequently resulted in the common position . #% The Maastricht Treaty may have created citizenship in principle , but it is a classic example of theory being impossible to put into practice . #% The Commissioner knows that I was pleased to act as the rapporteur on the latter programmes known collectively as Article 10 . #% Mr Khanbhai , who does not seem to be here , ended his speech by saying that he wanted to have fun . #% This report goes a long way to developing a positive approach for the whole of Europe . #% Parliament 's Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did . #% It helps sometimes to be a little ignorant of the difficulties . #% What worries me is that we are not going to do that properly . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , it is always controversial when you discuss your own budget , and we have seen that in our discussions on the amending budget and in our own budget for 2011 . #% She talked about a committee overseeing the convention , but she did not say what legal powers such a committee has . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate you on an excellent start to your presidency . #% No one thought to make inquiries and discover that he was partially deaf , which was why he gave contradictory answers . #% Mr President , the Prime Minster said that we should try for the four-fifths of Member States before the European Council would be able to -- or should -- discuss the crisis . #% So what you are telling me , President-in-Office , is that there is no coordination at all between the activities of the secret services of the Member States . #% We will not accept new terms and conditions that emerge from any particular Member State either on Friday night when the Ecofin Council meets or at any subsequent point . #% The Commission appreciates the supportive purposes of honourable Members in their reference in this oral question to implementation of the new career development policy ahead of formal agreement . #% Mr President , I seek your advice as to what redress I have against an inflammatory press release which has caused hate emails to be sent to my office . #% Madam President , this is a strange , uncomfortable and schizophrenic report . #% Mr President , in congratulating Mr Liese on the quality of his report I would like to concentrate on the three amendments which I , once again , put forward with his support . #% But of course that was to take account of the special difficulties facing one or two Member States . #% It is very timely and comes at a time when we are , in all Member States , debating the issues which have already been mentioned and which I will not labour - changing demographics , the gender challenge , to name just two . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to pay tribute to Alexandre Lamfalussy for the excellent work that he has done as the President of the European Monetary Institute and for the relationship that he has had with the European Parliament . #% What we are trying to gain from this session is a real dialogue , mainly with the Commission , but also with the Council , to seek guidance on how we should vote next week and to ask questions concerning events since the preliminary draft budget ( PDB ) was first presented . #% I hope , therefore , that the Council and Commission can , as it were , put our money where our mouth is , and redirect some of the enormous funds available for good governance , the development of civil society , democracy and the rule of law , which , in the external field -- the responsibility of Commissioners Patten and Nielson -- amounts to EUR 1.9 billion a year . #% We need someone more experienced . #% Finally , I congratulate Mr Van Rens . #% It is our moral duty and it is possible . #% It is counterproductive to introduce amendments which will effectively constrain the movement of animals between some existing Member States , as well as extending the scheme - as the United Kingdom and other countries with the current constraints would like - to countries that are not rabies-free . #% Firstly , it is only right and essential , when you have a statute for a European company , that you also have the active promotion of the participatory , consultative processes within that company for workers . #% We have seen that happen , but why we are surprised I do not know . #% Only yesterday , this House voted to allow EU fleets the rights to fish the waters of São Tomé , Príncipe and Angola . #% Can the Minister assure us that elder abuse will be given appropriate attention by Member States in the national action plans on health and long-term care ? #% Here is the point on which I shall finish : we won the argument from 1999 until May 2001 when the regulation was adopted . #% Mr Blair has been under intense pressure to surrender the British rebate of GBP 3 billion per annum in order to prevent the collapse of the EU budget talks for 2007 to 2013 . #% Mr President , as a supporter of enlargement to the whole of Europe , I was deeply disappointed by the statement from President Prodi which gave the green light for eventual Turkish and Balkan countries ' membership but excluded Ukraine permanently . #% In particular I thank Mr Olle Schmidt for the view that Sweden will join the euro and hopefully set a very good example for the UK , which will join very shortly afterwards . #% It demands the restoration of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property and it warns of grave consequences which would follow Iraq 's continued use of weapons of mass destruction . #% Indeed I am grateful that he has seen fit to accept five of mine : on defining the objective ; to provide adequate and fair incomes to older people and prevent poverty in old age ; on defining the gravity of the problem ; on the importance of promoting pension portability ; and , in particular , on the disgrace that certain EU institutions continue to discriminate against allowing older workers to apply for jobs - a point I have raised on several occasions with Commissioner Kinnock with , I regret to say , only bluster in response . #% I therefore see this as a purely political manoeuvre - President Bush placating domestic and special-interest lobbies . #% Good observation of the elections is going to be a vital part of ensuring that they are free and fair . #% I assume that relates to the Commission 's report six months before the date of accession , but I must say it would not give a good impression to the voters , either in the accession countries or in the European Union , if we start to apply safeguard clauses from day one . #% Hampton Court provided no evidence that the Presidency and particularly that the Prime Minister had any strategy . #% That is an area that needs to be watched . #% Mrs Grossetête perhaps needs to re-examine the whole question of the centralised procedure and access . #% This entire practice of adding water and , therefore , also other animal proteins to meats is misleading , deceptive and downright immoral in respect of its impact on some religious communities . #% In looking at the wider responsibilities of companies based in the European Union and the Union itself , my group has tabled amendments requesting Council to include in its remit for the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development the proposal for the negotiation of a legally binding international framework on corporate accountability and liability . #% We neglect them at our peril and , by continuing year after year to spend less on our cultural and educational programmes than we spend on growing tobacco , we are not just neglecting them , we are turning our priorities completely upside down . #% I hope the House will support it . #% Surely , therefore , we should be looking for a broader transatlantic partnership in which to define Europe 's role and America 's role and build on our common interests together . #% I would like to say what a great privilege and what a great job it has been . #% When I was responsible for this policy area in my home country , we did a lot of research , and a lot of research was done in the USA and other countries , to see how elder abuse could be prevented . #% Transgressions include abusing workers ' rights and causing them bodily harm , destroying local lands and livelihoods , promoting harmful products to consumers , breaking national laws and undermining local democracy . #% For example , when Saddam Hussein , in the early 90s , used these weapons in the marshes of Iraq , it took the United Nations three and a half weeks to get inspectors there , giving Saddam Hussein plenty of time to cover up the evidence of his crimes . #% Fourthly , will Member States not yet part of the euro be invited to be part of the mechanism ? #% Insufficient resources have been allocated to that important task . #% Mr President , I would like to join those of my colleagues who have already thanked our two rapporteurs , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , for their very helpful contributions to our debates this morning . #% As Members are now going to be electronically tagged as from February , I would very much suggest that this House tries to bring some discipline into voting time . #% But we opposed paragraph 5 calling for a ( European ) `` Public Prosecutor ' s office with jurisdiction over the Member States ' territory as a whole '' , implying that the European-level prosecutor would substitute for national prosecuting authorities . #% We have come quite a journey since the Commission produced its first White Paper . #% It is to establish , to make an assessment upon , to recognise merit and to provide reward in the development of an individual 's career according to the very best principles of accountable , efficient , independent , professional civil services at European Union level . #% During our visit to the Windward Islands last week , Mrs Kinnock , Mr Thomas and myself felt the enormous responsibility that the people of these islands were placing upon us . #% Public opinion will remain sceptical about the European project and , without the support of public opinion , the Commission will lack the necessary clout inside the Council . #% I hope that the support which you have received here will give you the courage to continue in this bold move and that we will finally see some reduction in the activity of this cartel and some improvement for the consumer across the European Union . #% This Parliament could give up any pretence to care either about civil liberties or about European business competitiveness . #% 
I support calls for Canada to withdraw its WTO challenge on the EU 's ban on seal products and am pleased that amendments outlining this position were adopted by Parliament . #% Above all , this is a human tragedy . #% There are no particular requests or demands from the groups or committees . #% The Commission 's proposal would have denied the less advantaged and lower - income groups from access to credit . #% This therefore amounts to a further transfer of power from the elected Parliament to the unelected Commission , whatever the Lisbon Treaty purports to say . #% Today 's sacking of the Romanian Justice Minister is a clear demonstration of the necessary political will for that process to occur . #% In conclusion , I broadly support the common position although I have some concerns with the ethical considerations . #% It is simply incredible that all this time later we are still transporting live animals huge distances within our continent . #% Mr President , in August the Norwegian freighter Tampa rescued 433 Afghans and four Indonesian crew members from a fishing vessel that had set sail from an Indonesian port . #% Neighbours should be there for one another ; that 's when good neighbours become good friends . ' #% Post has to keep up with developments elsewhere , not least the switch from consumer-to-consumer business to business and consumer , but also as regards the single market . #% We can not be serious about this without trying to add teeth in some form , moral , financial or otherwise to the concept of targets . #% Some of the particular points of concern raised in correspondence from all sorts of sources - individuals as well as firms - has been that the possession itself of a smart card should not be illegal and I agree with that . #% But let us not forget the impact on other developing countries . #% However , in addition to our united political reaction , we must adjust the European Union 's diplomatic standpoint . #% The accession process is continuing . #% . Mr President , the recalibration of the Hong Kong talks forced us all not to hope for historic breakthroughs . #% That gave Britain an opt-out from the Social Chapter threatening to deny , before the welcome arrival of Tony Blair 's Labour Government coming to the rescue , decent social standards to the people of Britain and condemned , at French insistence , Parliament to travel in perpetuity to Strasbourg , at a cost of EUR 400 million a year and the criminal inefficiencies entailed . #% Madam President , could we take this matter into consideration ? #% He was making an important speech to a full House but the only people listening were members of the public and our electorate in the Gallery . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Atkins for his report and also for his willingness to cooperate and work with not only my group but other groups in coming up with this document . #% You have been absolutely right : we have always had to fight our own corner for our own institutions and you have fought yours brilliantly but never deflecting from the principle of openness and transparency . #% Australia might not have major CO2 emissions , but it could lead the way in South East Asia - a very important area where increasing industrialisation is increasing those emissions . #% We have not implied we are a court or we have the powers of an investigating police officer or prosecutor , but we have done enough in cooperation and in complementarity with Dick Marty in the Council of Europe , with national MPs and judicial inquiries , to shift the burden of proof . #% I would like to make one or two remarks about some elements of my own report and particularly to highlight our negotiations with the Council - Mr President , unfortunately you have not had a chance to speak , but you were deeply involved in these - which achieved significant advances in the areas of data breach and particularly issues around the use of cookies and the rights that consumers have to refuse devices that may collect information on their computers . #% The British Government has already officially recognised Sharia law in some tribunals . #% It is the clear view of those most directly involved that , as initially announced , the plan would have both a disastrous effect on the industries concerned and an adverse effect on cod stocks , and this view is supported by conservationists . #% It commits the refounded Republic of Cyprus to supporting membership for Turkey itself and its transitional arrangements seem to be able to satisfy most of the demands concerning property , residency and self-esteem . #% Any policy area subject to unanimity will be blocked . #% Our preventative audio-metric testing will be made available under certain circumstances . #% Accordingly , I have to state for the record - for reasons I am not allowed space to expound on - that I do not believe this directive can or will address the real problems of businesses . #% I commend that amendment to the House as well . #% How do we move from here to make a post-Kyoto binding agreement that places requirements not just upon developed countries but also upon developing countries ? #% Yet we see the denial of human rights , the denial of the right of humanitarian NGOs to operate effectively on the ground . #% Also the point which has already been made that although this is for the health sector only at the present moment I would like to see it extended to other sectors like the prisons in particular . #% Member States have differing levels of BSE incidence but there are also variations in the measures to eradicate the disease and protect human health . #% We employ lawyers precisely to check on those points in good time , advise if there is a problem and indicate a solution . #% Did the Austrian Presidency know that it was celebrating the birth of a self-proclaimed Englishman ? #% Separate schemes to encourage intensive farming , like Tircymen in Wales , should be funded through separate agri-environmental schemes . #% The Commissioner talked about landlocked countries , etc. , but he needs to spell things out more clearly so that we know exactly what he means . #% But it is central , and we need to make sure that the Commission brings forward the legislation to deal with that . #% Companies will not become safer and more competitive if we hide these responsibilities . #% So all I make is a very simple request to the Commissioner tonight to listen to the debate and to heed the vote tomorrow . #% However , unless we are prepared to fight the terrorists politically and with genuine resolve , then the practical measures will come to nothing . #% Of the amendments , we support only Amendment 2 , taking the view that Amendments 1 and 3 are covered sufficiently by the existing text . #% We emphasise that the specialist and mainstream provision can go hand-in-hand and can complement each other , that the loss of the tied aspects of the research and development programme were not fully replaced with mainstreaming and that a specialist disability section should be allocated in the sixth framework programme now being discussed . #% With that final caveat , I wish to congratulate Mr Manzella once again and say that I shall be voting with my group for his report tomorrow . #% I want to follow the theme that he raised on safety , particularly with relation to health and consumer policies . #% The Union has been offered this chance to rethink its future and face up to the profound questions concerning its future direction . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Cunha for his report . #% in writing . - I fully support Evelyne Gebhardt 's report on the implementation of the Services Directive . #% A few weeks ago that field was dug up by bulldozers to create a municipal rubbish dump . #% However , there are for me a number of concerns which still remain and which still need further clarification . #% There are still perhaps a few reservations which I shall refer to in a moment , but we have come to a point where we believe we have a consensus in this House . #% This is a very important time for the European Parliament . #% Let us stop fussing about how we achieve marginal reductions in what we call fraud , and instead think more deeply about the true value that is added by all this misuse of EU taxpayers ' cash . #% It is a basic consumer right that consumers should be able to breathe fresh air . #% We now need to reinforce Mr Solana 's assurance with repeated testing offered as widely as possible and with the maximum openness from the American authorities . #% The point is that you can not separate trade and sustainable development . #% Environmental issues are important , but they have no bearing on the ability to drive a truck . #% Industry needs certainty and clarity . #% Madam President , could I ask you to invite colleagues , when they make declarations of that type , to assure themselves that the Member concerned has been informed of such a declaration ? #% Many consumers would be confused if given information about hanging or maturation , which could be mixed up with sell-by dates in their minds . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for a very good report and the Commissioner for being here at such a late hour . #% It is a small and select band of us who are involved in this very specialized area . #% None of the plaintiffs therefore attended . #% 
Commissioner Bolkestein would have us believe that it only concerns journalists if they recommend shares . #% Although we all appreciate that the environment is very important , the livelihood of human beings has to be the priority . #% So , maybe , using this wonderful Eurocrat vision of democracy , we should be the ones in power . #% In particular I pay tribute to the rapporteur for his determination both to strengthen and clarify an already good proposal . #% There will be more opportunities to attend the Councils but the Council wanted to see our proposals come to a state of reasonable maturity so that they were solid and worthy of the Council ' s consideration . #% The European Union wants us to meet our objectives of renewable energy . #% The vehicle is there in the decentralized procedure but as yet no licences have been granted through the centralized procedure . #% Mr President , as someone who is at least a quarter Irish , I welcome Ireland 's presidency . #% It will be a good day for Parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration . #% Therefore , we particularly welcome the Commission 's proposal that treatment granted to the EU be extended to all ACP-EPA partners before trade liberalisation with the EU . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur , this is the core consideration I have used in developing this proposal . #% The point is that accession countries such as Bulgaria should certainly not be disadvantaged because of those wider issues . #% Commissioners and their civil servants can very easily be brought in to be questioned and cross-examined . #% In other words , when you are outside this House , you are just the same as anyone else . #% I find it inconceivable that a man of the legendary eloquence of Commissioner Flynn does not feel moved to contribute at the end of this debate . #% I would have liked to equal that balance out from the 300 Commission spin-doctors that have been saying things about Marta Andreassen recently and point Members of Parliament 's attention to the fact that she was gagged by that very same Commission this morning . #% The right to access asylum must be reinforced , because we in this Parliament and the Commission are guardians of those rights : the right to asylum for those in need . #% Changing those rules is the priority for Doha , not launching a new round . #% Mr President , it was entirely predictable that whatever the findings of this report , it would call for increased powers to be taken by the European Union and , indeed , we were not disappointed . #% It must not be allowed to gather dust . #% I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting this report and the committee for passing it . #% I should like to give one other word of thanks before I finish , to Mr Waidelich , for the work that he did on the Jet project . #% The suggestion that , rather than simply coordinating plans for economic development , the European Union should be able to establish compulsory economic policies with sanctions or corrective action against Member States who do not comply is deeply disturbing . #% Before the next Commission is scrutinised I believe Parliament must instruct the Rules Committee to draw up comprehensive procedures covering all aspects of a much more thorough and in-depth series of hearings . #% For all my political career , I have been a decentralizer , whether it has been in UK local government or in seeking to open up the workings of the European Union . #% It would be interesting to hear from the Commissioner roughly how many people in her Directorate are responsible for this as compared to those overseeing the introduction of new legislation . #% Under that Article , if Parliament believes the Commission has failed to act , under the obligations imposed upon it by the Treaty , then the ECJ can be called upon to give a ruling . #% Amendment 103 concerning the length of detention and conditions ; #% Mr President , it seems to me that we need to distinguish two aspirations which are contained in the Galeote report and which to some extent lead in different directions . #% As for the 40 % reduction in fleet capacity , I trust this is an opening bid for debate to catch our attention . #% Nobody is expecting change overnight . #% If the EU really wants to help these countries , it should not help consolidate corrupt systems through more aid . #% The picture of the radioactive sources posing safety risks and risks to security through the acquisition of radioactive materials by terrorists seeking to make dirty bombs has been banished from the committee 's view . #% The sense of unity being displayed by Council and Commission , and by the diplomatic representatives in Oslo , concerning the ceremony which may take place on 10 December , is encouraging . #% Even individual Member States , such as Germany , have greater influence in Russia than the EU as an institution . #% Mr President , I should like to ask two questions . #% Let us make this applicable to the whole of the EU . #% Our long-term economic prospects depend upon a thorough modernisation of the European economy so that we can thrive in the increasingly competitive global marketplace . #% However , I would like to single out the calls for mountainous regions to be classified as agriculturally disadvantaged in relation to Structural Fund regulations , for permanent geographical handicaps to be taken more fully into account where rules on state aid are concerned and for the causes of emigration to be addressed . #% We welcome strongly and fully support the compromise on labelling and unbundling and on the dates of market opening . #% What on earth are political parties for if they are not for campaigning ? #% It will give the estimated 20 million people who are legally long-term residents in the European Union the legal framework of rights and obligations that will help to integrate them . #% I hope he will give us an assurance this evening that he is prepared to move from his overly cautious approach and join with us in the crusade to give consumers across Europe a better deal . #% I would like to hear from the Commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though , of course , we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities , which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern , because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is BSE , and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well . #% I trust that the Portuguese Presidency will use its renowned skills and experience to develop European Union appreciation of the problems that confront Pakistan and I would welcome Mr Lamy 's opinion on the current status of the Cooperation Agreement . #% We have also talked in the report about difficulties with social security systems and their lack of responsiveness , particularly when you are trying to keep people in touch with work , and they might then be doing casual work , temporary work , fixed contract work . #% In this report there are calls for Member States to coordinate their policies better , as well as calls for the Commission to develop a new ICT policy . #% Of course it is not being contained . #% Well , there is nothing just about life in Turkmenistan , but justice for the Turkmen people is what this debate is all about . #% It is incumbent on us in Europe to adopt policies , such as the easing of interest rates , to encourage growth , and the provision of appropriate financial support - not , however , just to help the rich and the speculators . #% There are many tools at our disposal that we are not even trying to exercise . #% Rainfall is more erratic and we have more droughts causing life-threatening fires across our continent . #% That is only one-third of the half a million or so young people who either go to the UK or leave the UK on work placement schemes . #% Could the Swedish minister please assure us that he will take up this matter and examine circumstances in which this kind of unequal treatment takes place , to ensure that regardless of religion or nationality people receive the same treatment from consular services by individual Member States ? #% Just as at home in UK things are not getting better and better , the words remain easy to say but they are often not followed by action and it is up to us to see that they are . #% There are atrocities on both side all the time and the civilian population is being squeezed . #% We consider as a committee that petitions are a valuable and empowering tool for democracy in what can often feel like a remote and anonymous institution . #% I will deal with the regional policy priorities first . #% I take that view with some regret because Mr Rothley is a very distinguished Member of this Parliament who has contributed a great deal to its work . #% Well frankly , that means that at the moment things are proceeding at a walking pace . #% Since the Commission will soon be proposing the introduction of a permanent , flexible retirement scheme into the Staff Regulations , further single measures of this kind are highly unlikely to be necessary in the future . #% So if we really believe in peace-making and peace-keeping , Member States must be prepared to have a defence budget commensurate with our ambitions . #% Could the Commissioner answer two questions . #% Mr President , the fact that negotiations are taking place is no secret : that was why I was able to ask the question - we do not disagree on that - but the problem lies in the content . #% Mr President , one year on we can take much satisfaction from what has been achieved by the Afghan people supported by the international community , but all this reveals the size of the mountain to be climbed . #% But whatever happens , the human rights abuses must stop . #% 
Mr President , I begin by welcoming the firm stand of the Council on the situation in Belarus and the sanctions that have been agreed . #% Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important . #% Perhaps we have to change the format of the hemicycle if it is so easy to simultaneously get your hands in two voting machines . #% Mr President , we Socialist members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believe that Mrs Diamantopoulou has shown herself to have the skills and attributes that she will need to become a good Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs . #% A fat lot of good it did , as EU growth is lower now than it was then . #% I note that this is the very government that rejected the A-400 M , which is , after all , the key element in European defence capability . #% Secondly , I am extremely pleased that our Government made this application , and a successful application at that . #% It shows , as the rapporteur said , that there is a 20-25 % difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse . #% There is no point in having access to information if it is too complex or too opaque to be comprehensible to the layman - it renders such access meaningless . #% Mr President , before I begin I beg your indulgence to join with Mr Poettering in paying tribute to the work of Mr von Habsburg in this House . #% It is a pity that the term `` Rapid Reaction Facility '' has been used for what after all should be a procedural matter , a financial management instrument . #% We also welcome the support given to greater cooperation between the EU and NATO , building on past experience , and the need for further development of capabilities . #% I would like to congratulate those involved on having worked so hard to make it possible for us to reach a first reading agreement so that this legislation can be adopted in good time before the next European elections . #% As each day passes the market becomes a reality . #% In 13 tightly-argued recommendations , we have made a cogent case for a new priority for health as part of a European decade for health , which will truly begin to meet the real needs of our citizens . #% One area where there could be clarification is the role of regional and local authorities , and we urge Members to support Amendment No 45 , which makes it clear that is the appropriate level for decision-making in some cases . #% That was after 600 , 000 tickets were sold on a discriminatory basis . #% I hope that we can single out one section of the labour market and ensure that by the end of the six-month presidency - and I hope it will be a very successful presidency - there is a very clear light at the end of the tunnel , particularly for the young people in Europe who really do still have faith in the whole project of building a strong European Union . #% So , as the rapporteur says , there can be no real security and there can be no developments without peace . #% Finally , Commissioner , you mentioned the changes to FIFA rules and regulations . #% If that means that the Palestinian Authority gets its money from Iran and Saudi Arabia , so be it . #% But there are eligible communities of a myriad of nationalities in all Member States . #% It is a simple attack on the resources which that channel has brought to quality programming in our country . #% The current threat of the mutation of avian flu demonstrates the role industry must play . #% NGOs need increased funding and assistance , not only for these areas , but also to rehabilitate victims . #% Of course this House must have compromise resolutions and must , so far as possible , be united . #% It is just a pity that the Council is not here to respond to our concerns and our calls for immediate action , because the Commissioner has done her work . #% Less congenial are the rapporteur 's comments on the supposed necessity of wage moderation and the slashing of public expenditure to meet the stability pact targets . #% We all have the same transport crisis and there may be common solutions to these common problems . #% In the United Kingdom too , chalk downland , dry bog and hedgerows have been destroyed in the name of EU standardisation . #% I believe it vital that we , the European Parliament , speak out and that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the arrest of democratically elected Palestinian representatives . #% Both Nigeria and Afghanistan are members of the international community and signatories to various international conventions guaranteeing human rights . #% The wider Sahel and northern areas of Mali are already suffering and in Burkina Faso farmers have already lost up to 90 % of their harvest and are having to sell their cattle to raise money for basic foods . #% You can then carry on with your projects and we can get back to running our own country . #% The results of an under-spend in the past have been that we have gone in for all these facilities -- water facilities , peace facilities -- which have had very limited democratic control . #% In Scotland , lawyers are encouraged to see tough rules as self-defence for lawyers , protecting them against the claim of involvement in crime . #% On this question , there is much in the resolution to commend in relation to promoting the role of directly-elected parliamentarians within the Joint Assembly . #% Thank you for your response . #% Nevertheless , the European Parliament was in favour of 20 weeks ' maternity leave at full salary , and 2 weeks ' paternity leave , and I believe that this is a sensible investment in the economy , helping reach the EU target of 75 % labour participation by 2020 . #% The extension of working time protection to road transport personnel in the directive , agreed at the end of last year , will cover owner-drivers , but only because parallel legal bases covering occupational health and safety on the one hand , and operational safety on the other have been used . #% Madam President , on behalf of the Socialist Group I congratulate the rapporteur . #% Why should we , every five years , have a half-year period where the EU 's work comes almost to a halt , while we first have the European elections and then an outgoing Commission that needs to be replaced by a new one that can only start work the following year in January ? #% I give notice that if a candidate is presented to us next week who can not give a commitment to serve a full eight-year term , then there will be a question mark over whether or not my group would wish to support that nomination . #% However , if the 10 % ceiling is raised to 30 % , it will mean the deployment of fewer but more focused projects in the future . #% As for the admissibility of the amendment , I draw to the attention of the services of Parliament and to your attention , Mr President , the fact that Annex V of our Rules of Procedure does not apply to the Parliament discharge but applies to the Commission discharge and therefore our amendments should be considered to be admissible . #% I do find it quite extraordinary that you say it is too early to talk about the detail of some of these plans , given that the Gothenburg Summit is not far away . #% Given as you say that the value of GSP is being eroded all the time because of the lowering of tariffs overall , what other mechanisms would you foresee in order to try to strengthen social and environmental performance among different developing countries ? #% Will the President-in-Office agree to pursue this matter directly ? #% I want it to be said loud and clear that those of us who want to see a more positive policy towards Turkey will have our voice silenced if the Turkish Government or Turkish society encourages mob rule against citizens of the European Union . #% That is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission 's proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system . #% Mr Brok , the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , mentioned our mission to Iran , during which we talked to a few of the tragic people who had suffered the consequences of that misuse of weapons of mass destruction , with Kuwaiti prisoners of war still being hidden and property still not returned . #% In his introduction Commissioner Solbes talked about sustainable growth , which is not the same as sustainable development - some growth can destroy the environment and jobs and is not particularly sustainable . #% You describe yourself as a centrist , a reformer and a Social Democrat , but you belong to the conservative group . #% Finally , I want an assurance of zero tolerance towards sexual abuse , exploitation and use of prostitutes who are victims of trafficking . #% Thankfully we have managed , between us , to agree to remove virtually all of the retrospective elements from this legislation . #% The whole process of those few days was virtually wasted until Saturday when the revised text appeared , to the consternation of developing countries . #% But it means that we must look carefully at the financial and social support for carers , which should reflect the much larger costs that society would otherwise bear . #% Philip Whitehead and I have also tabled an amendment to allow fair reporting of parliamentary and judicial proceedings . #% I also met the chairmen of key committees of the parliament and representatives of all political parties . #% I noticed just now that a Member of the Parliament was seeking to intervene rather more directly than I thought was appropriate . #% I am fully in support of that . #% Death and destruction can be caused by almost any means . #% I am pleased that the Council eventually saw sense when it adopted its common position on the directive and I pay tribute to the role of President Chiral in the lead he provided to the Council to get it to reflect the French crossparty positive approach to postal services as an essential public service . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , today , the call is for subsidies for fishermen because of the increase in fuel prices , tomorrow , it will be farmers and , after that , lorry drivers and then airline operators , and then what about the owners of petrol stations ? #% Frankly , the Council 's acceptance of this directive is the biggest challenge that the whole Lisbon proposal faces . #% The new Rule , however , leaves no option but to abstain on certain reports . #% 
In terms of the resolution 's reference to an ad hoc international tribunal , we should also recognise the need for Iraq to develop its own reformed judicial system within which perpetrators of crimes could be tried , and which could itself refer cases to the International Criminal Court . #% I prefer to call it ` the great giveaway ' . #% I have just been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis and the medication I am taking makes my asthma worse . #% We now have a window of opportunity , thanks to two new developments . #% Like most of us , she has been accused of being a stooge of the pharmaceutical industry , of being ignorant and insensitive . #% There are , of course , a great number of people with Bengali roots settled in London and other parts of the European Union , people originally from Dhaka , Sylhet and other parts of Bangladesh . #% However , it is important , particularly as we know that the European Court of Justice does have a clear competence in many areas , that the parameters of the competences of that court are clearly defined . #% Is there going to be an answer from our current Prime Minister or Chancellor of the Exchequer ? #% Why is it that the European Council has decided at this time that there is any reason to re-examine the EU 's arms embargo against China ? #% I refer to Rule 9 ( 3 ) , which concerns former Members of this House . #% British Conservatives by their very nature oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business . #% I understand that a delegation will be sent to the second hearing on 25 April 2003 , and I hope that arguments will not be found to cancel that as well . #% I think that they can . #% Keeping them in from the sun a lot of the time ? #% Surely , this makes a mockery of transparency and transgresses the principle that the names of all those who are paid from public funds should be published . #% There is a great deal of activity going on in the research field in our region already , which shows what can be achieved by way of generating local employment , not just at the universities of Exeter and Plymouth . #% I know the risks and dangers and the importance of quality and safety in our blood supplies . #% Mr President , I am grateful to the Commissioner for indicating the support of the Commission , in principle , for both amendments being tabled in plenary today . #% My second point is that I think we need to make the relaunch of the single market an eighth flagship initiative . #% What price harmonised taxes then ? #% Let us oppose this latest example of red tape from the top . #% Thirdly , it is interesting that Thailand is involved in trying to broker peace . #% I hope that the Commission will take a strong line and ensure that those national action plans are ambitious both in scope and in implementation , given what is now realistically and viably achievable . #% All the Commission 's money comes from the taxpayers of the Member States or , to be precise , the taxpayers of the 14 Member States which are net contributors . #% They also demonstrate the power of the European Parliament . #% What kind of adjustment mechanism or declaration is likely to be used to make this voting system acceptable to these countries ? #% Such variations suggest that health and safety levels are not the same for all workers across the European Union . #% We hope it will bear fruit in a couple of weeks ' time . #% It is still a beautiful holiday destination and you are all welcome to visit it . #% The Commissioner and my honourable friend the rapporteur will understand what that means , because it is Greek , but for other colleagues it means patients who have suffered severe disability or severe health problems as a result of accidents in hospital . #% Let us not forget that since the end of June , over 200 Palestinians -- at least 44 of them children -- have been killed ; nor forget that thousands more have been forced to flee their homes ; nor forget that when we talk about the Israeli prisoners , who must indeed be freed , there are also 9 000 Palestinian prisoners who remain in Israeli prisons , over half of whom are detained without trial ; nor forget that elected Hamas parliamentarians remain under arrest . #% Also evident in this directive is the sinister presence of Galileo , the EU 's ` big brother ' spy satellite , its eye in the sky . #% Mr President , this is a small but significant measure to extend the duties of Member States to carry out strategic environmental assessments on the planning framework as well as on the actual plans where the implementation would or could have a significant impact on the environment . #% I should make it clear to the House that I am talking about meat infected with low pathogenic avian influenza , not about vaccinated meat , in case there is any confusion on that matter . #% But still , as friends , and , in most particular , because of our deep profound partnership with Egypt , we ask it to think again . #% The question is , will it work in the European Union ? #% I hope your plane crashes . '' ! #% On trade , it remains a concern that the European Commission failed to get common agreement with our ACP partners in the run-up to the Seattle WTO meeting . #% When safe biological limits are being exceeded , we all expect action and I commend the action that is being taken . #% Mr President , I call upon you to issue a note of protest to Dr Mahathir concerning the flawed political trial practised on Anwar Ibrahim , a note of protest in accordance with the many critical resolutions passed by this Parliament concerning Malaysia . #% We have to ensure that their administrations are modernised . #% Mr President , I hope you will send a message of congratulations to the Council on its decision to meet henceforth in public when discussing codecision legislation . #% The good news is that we do finally have EU legislation ; the bad news is that the Commission proposal is distressingly weak and will need comprehensive improvement in order to become meaningful and effective . #% I welcome Mr Sacconi 's report as the first step in the right direction . #% Let us just hope that we get that large majority . #% Thirdly , the substance of the debate : that needs to be considered in terms of papers , broad dialogues and other ideas of this kind . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the joint rapporteurs , commend this report and incidentally say that I believe it is a justification for the contact committee which we maintained for a period of time , as well as the two main committees which endorse what has been said by the rapporteurs . #% The United States - not only have the United States failed to introduce internal legislation to bring their home market in line with the GPA they have not even introduced the GPA itself , and what is more they do not have any intention of so doing before the election of this year , if at all . #% I would like to use my last few seconds to make an appeal to the Commission . #% There are still some problems with overdrafts and credit intermediaries , but Parliament can claim credit for achieving significant improvements to this proposal which I hope will be accepted in the final directive when it is agreed in the next Parliament . #% Even now , the Ecofin Council has added in some conditionality to the new auditing power , actually less restricting than many of us feared , but has it undermined the possibility for really early investigation and intervention ? #% To pick up on Mr Provan 's point , under Rule 130a it is the responsibility of all of us here , between now and the vote , to simplify the voting procedure . #% This is a period of dramatic change in technology . #% Let us be clear in our thinking and let us have a clear strategy so that we can assure Europe 's citizens that in ten years ' time they will have a stable , prosperous and effective European Union . #% There are too many managers involved and , as a result , the project ends up not being fully managed . #% The changes in the regional development funds are important . #% The United States felt that its national security was threatened after the 9/11 attacks and therefore had to detain large numbers of suspects until the lack of danger could be proven . #% That is our duty : to give the people of Europe common choice , common opportunities and common relief from many of the diseases and ailments from which they currently suffer . #% That has come under pressure from those who argue that it does not meet the priorities of economic competitiveness as defined in the Lisbon Agenda . #% That is a tribute to the work that Mr Matsakis has done . #% This of course means that we will get the benefits of improved environmental and safety standards for vehicles , consistent and independent validation of performance and that true level playing field we often hear businesses talking about . #% Then again , after the vote in the plenary , it is my job also to reflect that position . #% Mobility in Europe is less than half that of the United States . #% There are still one or two countries where the Commission and Parliament are separate in terms of structure and we need to be particularly vigilant in instances where more than 75 or 80 % of the appropriations go into paying for salaries and buildings rather than adequate information policies . #% in writing . - We opposed this motion because it purported to place a responsibility on European countries for the plight of the undeveloped Third World , rather than placing the responsibility on those countries themselves . #% It is vital that these ensure that conventional and organic growers should not lose out as a result of this technology . #% 
Why was my question to the Council not printed ? #% Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate . #% There is no immediate or real danger of a ban being put into effect . #% These appointments should be an opportunity to put a stop , once and for all , to the nightmare vision of an ever more centralised and bureaucratic European foreign and security policy , in favour of one that is based on willing cooperation amongst our Member States . #% The peoples of Europe have lost confidence in you and in these institutions . #% We all agree that Socrates I has provided us with a vital building block in the lives of young Europeans . #% Whatever the benefits of the alternative methods of dispute settlement , the consumer should not be deprived of the possibility of a remedy . #% Therefore , as has been said , it is sadly ironic that despite having brought forward organic crop regulations several years ago , the Commission has only now come up to date with livestock production in the wake of a stream of health disasters related to meat . #% That will be our position , I am sure . #% However , I believe that the air ticket levy is also important because it marks a turning point in the quest for the introduction of global levies for the financing of global development needs . #% We must not allow it to be destroyed and we should , in fact , give no more support to the West Bank until they are prepared to work together with the rest of Mostar to build a peaceful community . #% Finally , I would like to commend the proposed amendments on establishing a committee of European energy regulators so as to improve cooperation and coordination in implementing the regulation on cross-border trading . #% That is what they really want when they talk about change of title here . #% Had this had been the case , they could have then gone out and sold their products much more forcibly . #% She has worked in a very open-handed and friendly way . #% We have to admit that the state can not do everything , but if we admit that , we also have to be very clear about the dangers of using soft law . #% In the report by Mrs Fourtou , whom I congratulate , the Committee on Petitions is for the first time bringing a specific petition to the floor of the European Parliament . #% I must also note that Mr Elles ' speech in which he set out six priorities of the PPE-DE Group was very good . #% I salute the courage of EU candidate countries who have backed the coalition with specialist forces . #% I call upon the Commission to take a more robust attitude to the enforcement of this regulation . #% We may want to review where the political union goes and the changes we make to the Constitution , but the internal market must continue to be the driving force during the British presidency . #% That is vitally important . #% It will be very important for the new registry - and I direct this particularly to the Commission - that the launch date and the priority registration period are very well publicised throughout the European Union so that people understand those rights . #% These remarks are a re-hash of allegations that he has previously made of irregularity and worse . #% Furthermore , if debts are not repaid , creditors will also be able to claim compensation form debtors for recovery costs . #% The outcome of the votes in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety is a report that is the first step towards a coherent approach being taken towards mercury and the ultimate reduction of mercury levels in the environment . #% The Commission 's proposal would ban animal testing within the EU , but that would simply send such testing to non-EU countries where standards of animal welfare may be much lower . #% However , the Council must now put real pressure on the American Government at the EU-US Summit next month to close down Guantánamo Bay once and for all . #% However , we do not cooperate enough . #% Moreover we demand that foreign companies investing in Burma , such as Total and Premier Oil , should freeze their investments immediately . #% So , as of September , however it may be done - perhaps you could let off a siren at ear-piercing levels - the Commissioner should be heard , like any other speaker in this Chamber , in dignity and silence . #% I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report . #% I propose an amendment that would allow each of us here to send one free four-sided newspaper to each of our voters every year to tell them what we are doing . #% The Nato umbrella could properly protect the UN 's essential guiding hand in an advisory , humanitarian and developmental role . #% Turkey deserves our thanks for making such a vital contribution to the settlement . #% On a point of order , Mr President , can I ask the Commissioner whether he will be attending a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development next week where some of us who have detailed knowledge of what is actually happening in our constituencies can put detailed points to him which are really very important ? #% I would like also to reflect on the imminence of the Olympic Games . #% The elections have not delivered democracy . #% As the money laundering defences of banks have strengthened , criminals have sought new ways of hiding their money . #% We congratulate Mrs Frays on her report and will broadly support its adoption . #% The Cairo summit will be followed up by another forum in Dakar on basic education . #% If Hamas has any claim to be taken seriously by the international community , it should at least now show unequivocally that the conditions of his incarceration adhere to international humanitarian laws . #% The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities . #% Yet we have these most unfortunate men charged with an offence that we in the European Union can not accept as a matter of anything other than rank discrimination . #% We should not , in my view , adopt these proposals as they stand because they are unrealistic , potentially damaging and will seriously harm medical research across the whole of the European Union . #% I am often quite surprised by how relatively simple ideas are turned into the most complex nightmares as we go through that process . #% It really is most reprehensible that there has been not only an apparent flouting of the formal rules for Commissioners , but also a contravention of the spirit of transparency and trust that should be the basis of the work between this Parliament and Commissioners . #% From now on we should perhaps both accept and welcome a permanent creative tension between our two institutions - that , after all , is the heart of a mature parliamentary democracy . #% I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone . #% Secondly , the meeting scheduled for 11 November 2002 will not now take place and I hope we can move an oral amendment to make the point more general in terms of wanting EU involvement at all levels in these discussions . #% I hope that duty-free stays and Mr Rübig and his fellow countrymen and women come to Nord/Pas de Calais , take a trip across the Channel on these ferries that represent excellent value for money . #% Therefore , whichever way you look at it , these goods should have EU tariff-free access as they come from territories covered by one or other free trade agreement . #% We must maintain European consumers ' complete confidence in poultry meat and products . #% All these fields of work will benefit from better research and dissemination , which the Daphne programme can fund . #% These are all things we thoroughly welcome . #% We would like to see whether there are going to be amendments available for the financial regulation to enable us to make sure that monies allocated are properly spent . #% It is this issue which will unblock this mechanism and will bring about worker involvement , not participation or codetermination , as all the arguments seem to centre on . #% That is the reality we are facing , one which Mr Khanbhai deals with very well indeed . #% The majority of the amendments made by the committee seek to exempt ling and tusk from the scope of the regulation , although they would still be covered by quotas . #% The report also needs to show , quite clearly , where the reforms have not taken place . #% It is a good road map and it will get us through this process . #% I call on the Commission to tell us what actions it will be taking if the Greek authorities fail to implement the Community directive appropriately . #% In Parliament 's verbatim report it fails to register your statement that ` no amendments were submitted ' . #% Mr President , the Skinner report provides a sensible response to the October 2000 Commission communication to implement the risk capital action plan which dates back to the 1998 Cardiff Summit and dovetails neatly with the financial services action plan which Barcelona has made a priority . #% The -- Zimbabwe 's only independent daily newspaper -- is still closed , despite the courts ordering its reopening , and now the news editor and chief reporter of the have been arrested under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act . #% I went with Mrs Schroedter from the Green Group and Mr Bösch from the Socialist Group . #% 
Security cooperation with Russia , through NATO , also requires further work . #% The Commission is the government of the European Union and it has the sole right to initiate law -- something which the constitutional treaty does nothing to amend . #% Amendment No 9 seeks to outlaw the use of fixed gill nets in this fishery as they risk inflicting substantial unintended mortality on heavily depleted stocks . #% There appears to be no mechanism , despite what the Commissioner said , for ensuring either of two things : first , that the additionality rule is applied to this calculation , and second , that the amount of EU funding which ultimately reaches individual regions corresponds directly to the amount earmarked for those regions at the planning stage . #% The minister referred to ` consensus ' , but not to ` majority ' . #% Later on I paid 1 000 Ugandan shillings in the Sheraton Hotel for just one cup of coffee ! #% But we do not support the proposed changes in the legal base , nor the idea of extending the response to emergencies outside the EU , nor the increase in budget . #% My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information , it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a case . #% They have produced all the necessary reports , but they have to have meetings in June , which does not tie in with our budget calendar . #% The European Union must make a stand . #% They regard us with distrust , rightly or wrongly . #% Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council . #% This poor guy will be skinned in the courts by his wife for not paying the contributions . #% But it is not just Kyoto . #% So much of that is caused by the cruelty or neglect of adults and the least adults can do is to ensure that when a child genuinely has no family we apply the provisions of the Inter-Country Convention when giving that child another chance in life through adoption . #% That was an important point of progress . #% Mr President , I wish to start with my customary , but nonetheless heartfelt , thanks to the three rapporteurs , Mr Herman , Mr Argyros and Mr van Velzen . #% If control of funding were to be returned to national governments , I am confident that the UK Government would be aware of the serious need for funding in my own region - the South-West - where we have suffered tremendously from the effects of the EU 's disastrous common fisheries policy and common agricultural policy . #% In addition , education policy is , and should remain , the preserve of individual nation states . #% Everyone recognises that Parliament adopts its own annual report and resolution on human rights in the world and on the European Union 's policy . #% This is one of the subjects to have attracted the most debate and argument over the last two years . #% That was started by Commissioner Mandelson , who then overran , so that in the end there was only the opportunity for Commissioner Špidla to answer two questions . #% My question there concerns the former checking , because if we are looking at 5.9 % of transactions being irregular , that is more than 1 in 20 and the 2 different kinds of checking by the Commission and the Court need to be aligned . #% On the Services Directive , the compromise package agreed by Parliament must be improved upon by governments . #% I support the Commission 's proposals for common measurements so that we all know what we are looking at and what we are hearing across the European Union . #% It is quite clear , looking around here this evening , that there is not an overwhelming interest in these technical directives among Members of the European Parliament . #% I strongly support the Nicholson report , and I congratulate the rapporteur on its content and quality , after considerable rebalancing during the committee stage , both in tone and in terms of its approach . #% This is a good , thoughtful and thorough report . #% Their working hours need to be tailored to their treatment pattern and their reabsorption into the workplace needs to be built around their rehabilitation . #% I should also like to say how helpful the French presidency was in making sure that we made rapid progress . #% It is a pity that Bulgaria and Romania may now suffer the consequences of this . #% We must take whatever action we can to oppose terrorism of that kind . #% We should roundly condemn the fact that Israeli defence force attacks since 2001 have effectively destroyed EUR 25 million of EU development projects . #% This meeting has been made possible by the sustained pressure from the EU , the contact group and others in the international community on both sides over the last two months for a meaningful dialogue to begin . #% It seems to me that these are important issues , but they should be considered in another context . #% It has taken a great deal of effort to persuade the rapporteur to bring forward a report closing the accounts for 1996 so that we can proceed with the 1997 discharge . #% This is a very important point which was brought up by Mr Pérez Royo , particularly the matter of is it planning to take any measures to ensure the Community legislation is respected ? #% There is a vast range of other products apart from the exemptions that are included in this praiseworthy proposal , and we should not forget that when talking about some of the specific issues . #% This report goes a very long way to sharpening up legislative procedures in the EU and therefore I welcome it . #% Let us build Europe on the playing fields of Europe . #% I also welcome the rapporteur 's views on the role of ethics committees and agree that the safety and dignity of patients must remain the utmost priority . #% This turn of events also calls into question the effectiveness of EU action against the military dictatorship . #% Mr President , I congratulate my West Midlands colleague on the excellent work she has done as Parliament 's rapporteur on this vitally important topic . #% Would he give us an indication of how he will deal with this issue in the negotiations with the ACP ? #% In the meantime , the decision about a response to the speculations and the allegations about misuse of assistance funds is primarily a matter for the IMF , the World Bank and the G7 countries , since they are obviously the main suppliers of direct financial assistance . #% However , as well as us understanding their position , the Americans need to understand our objections , and our Foreign Ministers and Prime Minister must convey these objections this week . #% What we really need for the public , who are beginning to panic , is clarity . #% This is very fair and indeed this code has been welcomed by the social partners and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes . #% Commissioner McCreevy , I too should like to start off by talking about how best we support small and medium-sized enterprises . #% In view of the upcoming elections on 15 September , I am still not sure that we have reconstructed enough houses there . #% In total it is a report of almost 400 pages , which must be one of the biggest reports to come before this Parliament . #% Therefore , to refuse to accept the budget on that basis is not really valid . #% Compare and contrast our position on phthalates with our position on tobacco . #% There is no problem with urgency being granted and we can do it without report and without debate . #% The work of the EIB is highly commendable but two points should be taken on board . #% He knows the British Presidency has been a disaster . #% This group is in favour of extending the Lamfalussy procedure to banking and insurance . #% I am not ecstatic about the result . #% Forty thousand - as you have probably already heard - are seriously injured ; seriously enough for them to have three or more days off from work . #% The idea here is that we should differentiate between the types and significance of own-initiative reports . #% The Committee on Budgetary Control decided quite wisely , in my view , that we should take an apolitical stance on this . #% We do very much concern ourselves with promoting good quality control and screening , but of course it is a matter for the Member States how they organize their own screening activities . #% In the wake of BSE , DG XXIV was given a significant role in the whole area of food policy . #% Well done Bulgaria -- and welcome ! #% He has been able to tread the perilous path between alarmism on the one hand and complacency on the other . #% 
I thank the Commissioner for his extensive answer and in particular his ad hoc remarks at the end . #% It is accepted in the Commission work programme . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - I too would like to offer my support and that of the ALDE Group to Alan Johnston and his family . #% But instead of giving us more time , the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings . #% Here I was , seven years ago , being told that , because of that weekend meeting in Lisbon , we were about to become the most high-technology economy in the world with full employment and high growth rates . #% They are alleging that it creates a centralised superstate with all powers handed over to Brussels , where Brussels will be able to overrule national policy in every area of governance . #% Well , what price free speech , what price democracy ? #% We must bear in mind , of course , the very different situation countries like Malta will find themselves in . #% Because of all these concerns , it is understandable that the European Parliament should wish to be both informed and consulted in advance of decisions . #% My only criticism on this Foreign Affairs Committee report would be its unevenness in places and its over-reliance on third-hand reports . #% What we would like to do is to progress some of those concrete ideas . #% I defy anybody to tell me whether there is one citizen anywhere in the European Union who wants to know how David Hallam voted on the second part of Amendment 20 of the Florenz Report . #% We do believe that there should be objective and independent criteria on how the system is managed , with incentives offered for the achievers and penalties offered for those who do not meet the desired levels . #% We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening . #% The ALDE Group warmly welcomed the initiative to draft an urgency resolution on the Congo . #% Many of my colleagues have given graphic examples of the problems associated with the counterfeiting on a large scale of physical goods that are being shipped into the European Union and essentially sold illegally , thereby depriving people of their legitimate livelihoods . #% The single market is one of the great achievements of the European Community . #% Let us demand , therefore , that the rights of political and other prisoners are fully respected and let the European Union support the establishment of the rule of law from top to bottom , a justice system to support the Iraqi-elected Government . #% This role would be undermined if the Member States themselves are not seen to be champions of the EU laws they are supposed to uphold . #% Saying that we can move up the value-added chain will only work for so long . #% Nevertheless , what is being said is not being lost , of course : it is being heard outside . #% We still have to state constantly and categorically our concern for human rights and democracy in Turkey . #% One such accident is enough . #% And could he assure us that they are taking the Commission to account for producing proposals that have not been properly subject to the sort of impact assessments that the Commission has pledged to carry out to ensure that the business and competitiveness burden on proposals is properly looked at ? #% It seems that it is not appropriate for the President of Russia to be lampooned in this way and so he will not tolerate it . #% I welcome the action plan and the effort that both the Swedish presidency and most recently , the Danish presidency , have put in to the Northern Dimension . #% My meeting with the President of India meant that I was unable to vote on this resolution . #% Also , the parliament controls the government 's annual budget . #% That depresses timber prices , it strips natural resources and tax revenue , and it increases the poverty of forest-dependent peoples . #% I too believe that the inshore fishing community is very much the backbone of our fishing community . #% That has to be balanced against the possible consequences for the energy strategies and the energy industries of the European Union . #% There is a saying in the United Kingdom that if the cap fits you should wear it ! #% The European Union must now follow suit with its own code of good administrative behaviour . #% I would like to make it quite clear that the Socialist Group would like to insist that an appeal is made if the eventual judgment is adverse . #% My final point is this : the resolution by the EPP and the Liberals is factually incorrect . #% Making them automatic will hardly make them more credible if the belief remains that a political solution might be found to avoid them . #% The UK Labour Government has little interest in defending their cause , and has informed Gibraltar that it will be marginalised and financially pressured into falling into line with UK European strategic goals if they do not support the outcome of the talks . #% It is absolutely right that Parliament should , at this stage , make it perfectly clear to the government that we expect democratic standards to exist in that country . #% Thus , we seek a coherent performance for the European Union both at home and abroad , based on consistent strategic thought and action . #% The STCW Convention of 1978 , blessed by the International Maritime Organization , was updated in 1995 to take into account new technological developments on board vessels and also the more modern training methods currently used . #% But equally , agricultural products from a Member State , Poland , were blocked by Russia for reasons which many would find it difficult to understand . #% I also feel that the strong and welcome commitment made last year by us all -- the Commission , Parliament and , in particular , the Council and the Member States -- is now seriously under threat and the Committee on Development has to express its deep concern about the effects of the Financial Perspectives on its work . #% While today President Santer and I have been focusing on the employment guidelines , we also approved two other documents . #% The text does not make clear the requirement for there to be complete and transparent reform of all Members ' expenses . #% We will vote tomorrow for the opening of the chapters on fundamental rights and judiciary and on the common foreign and security policy , not because we want to be weak on these issues , but because we want to be strong . #% The motivation is clear : it is to create a European demos which at the moment simply does not exist . #% The report on monitoring the application of Community law that is before the House today is the seventeenth that has been produced in response to the request originally made by this House in a resolution in 1983 . #% Mr President , I am reassured by the Prime Minister 's determination to focus on the Balkans and advance their progress towards the EU . #% Now that has been clarified , there is no reason whatsoever not to apply this interinstitutional agreement in full . #% Five , finally I would urge the Commission and the Council to insist on -- indeed to demand -- firm deadlines by which responses to the Ombudsman , the Committee on Petitions and , above all , to the petitioners or complainants , are made . #% I hope that is clear to the House . #% The rapporteurs were given a clear mandate by Parliament for discussion with the Council . #% Mr President , as an MEP representing a farming area , I have first-hand experience of how devastating the BSE crisis has been to British agriculture . #% As Mr Prodi knows , this new article added to the Treaty by the Maastricht Treaty gave Parliament the right to request the Commission to submit legislative proposals . #% I am not sure whether Mrs Wallström is still there , and I do not know whether she is responsible for inventing these wonderful phrases , but we need a much more structured and practical strategy approach from the Commission than these gimmicky words . #% For those who would like to see more radical opening-up of cross-border mergers , there is also the promise of a clearer view in the next Parliament and the prospect that the markets themselves can add to the pressures on companies to apply best practice in consulting their shareholders . #% Now , to our amazement , category of animal is back , and once again the Environment Committee has voted to remove it . #% Colleagues , if we do not have the support of the Council we will get nowhere . #% My concern is that the high calorific value waste will be cherry-picked for coincineration and this in turn will push up the cost of the specialist toxic waste incinerators which will mean that they will have to actually buy in fuel in many instances to achieve the high temperatures which are required to destroy things like dioxin . #% We are against any attempt to bring in an EU quality logo which would only be available to EU produce , since this would discriminate against farmers from third countries and would not be in line with our development objectives . #% Mr President , this is an important milestone in the creation of the single market . #% Nevertheless , there are now very alarming signals that the Americans may not support the work that has been done so far . #% For example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990 . #% We need to acknowledge that all these fine objectives will demand that we support the supply side in developing countries , because they simply will not have the capacity to deal with these fine objectives . #% There are a lot of examples , but I will give a few here to the House . #% Let me suggest that the aspirations of Tampere can be better met in the public law area of the intended Charter of Fundamental Rights than by further imposed legislation which harmonises our private law traditions . #% 
I watched a programme on ZDF and as a British citizen from a beef area I was appalled at the almost hysterical attack on the British beef industry in that programme . #% We have a Commissioner and a Minister just going through the motions . #% We have taken on the priorities of the Financial Perspective . #% Twenty-one of our thirty amendments have been accepted by the Council . #% Provided that public authorities clearly specify the environmental criteria that the product or service must meet in an unambiguous and non-discriminatory way , then there is nothing to stop them from doing that . #% I am , of course , very happy that the new common position has been established by the Council and that it has strengthened the position as compared with the past . #% Third , a number of us consider that the additional costs involved do not warrant extension of some of the measures to aquaculture , though I would add this is not my own view . #% It has built popular support , perhaps as much as 40 % , by providing numerous social services in an atmosphere of pessimism , anger and joblessness . #% We look forward to the body preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which it would be appropriate for a representative of this Parliament to chair , producing a document which can confer direct rights on EU citizens and enable them as individuals to enforce their rights in the European Court . #% One issue I particularly commend is the recognition of the type of work that agencies such as the Bilbao Health and Safety Agency perform . #% This is a matter for local authorities and for national governments and should not be a matter for this Parliament and for Europe . #% Mr President , I have had two opportunities to visit Burma since I became a Member of this House . #% These churches are not just of religious significance : they also have a social and cultural purpose within the community . #% I welcome your comment that you are going to reflect , but I urge you to reflect also on the phrases that you have put into this excellent document -- the programme of your presidency -- which I particularly welcome . #% There is still the space to think that personal and private data will remain protected , so I will listen with great interest as to why those who oppose this regulation do so . #% When the Council takes that attitude , we are left talking to the backside , although sometimes we get more sense out of the backside of an ostrich than out of some of the people that we do have to speak to ! #% Mr President , I would like to join those who have congratulated the President-in-Office of the European Council , Mr Juncker , for the real efforts that he made to try and reach a decision on these very difficult and complex issues at the European Council last week . #% I submit that it is a matter for this House , that freedom of speech should be absolute and it is the duty of the Bureau to maintain it . #% When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety . #% As the law requires , consultations on those proposals will be undertaken with staff and with the other European Union institutions . #% Four governments reappointed their Commissioners . #% Another point that some of us are slightly concerned about -- and it comes up time after time in these debates -- is the precise role of the European Food Safety Authority . #% This is the only occasion in history , that I can think of , where citizens can be consulted before a constitution is drawn up rather than afterwards . #% With such uncertain returns it seem unlikely that there will be any commitment to providing the necessary facilities . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner : what is the negative response from Brussels ? #% Many regard this as ambitious , but not unrealistic . #% These technologies made the distinction between a telephone call , a television broadcast and an Internet page access quite pronounced in terms of delivery and content . #% It was only on Monday evening that we finally voted in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection - again in a late and hurried fashion . #% Is he still being disciplined by the Commission and has any of his pay which was docked in the past been refunded to him ? #% Article 27 is particularly important in the general directive in that respect . #% Few people in Britain realise how their country is being fundamentally changed in order for it to become merely a region of a United States of Europe . #% The Commissioner should particularly read Ruggie 's strong criticism of governmental failures to respect human rights considerations as the Commission develops its new competence on investment . #% However , in a Community where there are approximately 20 million people unemployed - and since we are faced with the prospect of a further 42 000 people who are employed in the tax-free industry facing unemployment - I should prefer it if the Commission , via the Council , could undertake very serious research to give us the facts as they stand at the present time . #% The public can see through this particular fanciful idea . #% The British Sports Minister , in particular , is very keen that we should see higher profile for sport within the European Union . #% Perhaps that is the Commission 's fault for not communicating the message . #% But when I look back over these two years I see that we have kept promises to establish , for the first time ever , an independent , professionally led and staffed internal audit service , a central finance service , audit capabilities in every directorate-general , an audit progress committee that bears comparison with any comparable mechanism in the private or public sector anywhere in the European Union . #% So far as Mr Dell ' Alba ' s geographical excursion into islands and boot-shaped countries is concerned , as I say I am looking forward to answering his further question and doing so in great detail . #% Let there be no difference between us and the Commission on this issue . #% Mr President , obviously we welcome this report because it serves to harmonize driving licences and develop a system of codes which can be easily understood by all authorities throughout the EU . #% That in itself has budgetary implications in terms of the money that the European Union gives UNHCR . #% The presidency and the Commission urged the two principal parties to continue to work together in support of a negotiated political solution to the longstanding conflict . #% This agreement is a victory for common sense . #% We can not in Europe look only at the way we produce our food under the CAP . #% We do not recognise the view , apparently emanating from the Socialist Group , that the SGP currently incorporates unnecessarily restrictive fiscal rules . #% We do not wish to see Croatia then blocking the aspirations of other candidates . #% There was the attack on Radio Television Hong Kong by a member of the Chinese Peoples ' Political Consultative Conference . #% It is interesting to see the panic setting in amongst the federalists at last ; the cracks are really showing . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement . #% Mr President , as I have said in this Chamber on previous occasions , I have the privilege of working in a very interesting Legal Affairs Committee and being one of the few non-lawyers on the committee . #% The spending of international aid should be returned to national states . #% Yet we now have a Tory MEP , Mr Bowis , asking how the EU will enhance its social role in economic policy . #% We need coherence , we need consistency , we need to have an understanding of what self-reliance actually means , providing a ladder out of poverty , and we also need to understand about creating real global partnerships . #% This is just one example of the positive benefits the European Union brings to its citizens . #% It is very easy to do that because these incidents are often very individual , but collectively they represent the equivalent of two or three jumbo jet loads of passengers in Europe dying each and every week . #% There can be no re-channelling . #% In addition to demanding that the KLA withdraw , we must also demand that the security forces withdraw , but it has to be both . #% We think that the vote of the Environment Committee fully reflected our views and we will be giving our support to all the amendments passed by that committee , particularly those which clarify the provisions of the directive and reduce the scope for the use of national plans , so making the proposal more European-wide and more single market orientated . #% In conclusion could I also invite him to confirm to the House tonight what he said to the Legal Affairs Committee the other week , namely that the sales promotion regulation continues to have his full support and is entirely compatible with the suggested proposals . #% Because this is a very important matter , the proposed Treaty creates an interesting precedent in extending the in a limited and very specific field to third countries , albeit that two of them should be joining the European Union very shortly or others are in various stages of negotiating accession . #% I am also glad that we have a commitment to the White Paper . #% The European Union can , and must , provide more financial support for this work and , in doing so , we will honour the work of Dr Jaramillo and ensure that his death was not in vain . #% If we were to go along with one of the proposals that the Verts/ALE Group made , the lights would go out all over Europe ! #% If we are replacing or enhancing our legal system and access to justice , these issues are key to civil society and they can not and must not be tackled without the input of democratically elected Members . #% Members opposite have been raising the issue of the European arrest warrant - this incident shows precisely why Members on this side of the House have concerns about a European arrest warrant . #% What we need is either to have a stringent rule simply stating : ` When over 50 amendments have been tabled to a report , the President must request the committee to meet again ' , or else to drop this . #% 
I will not be happy to see , however , limits on the allocation of allowances , on the introduction of an untried system of benchmarking , or on limiting access to international trading systems as foreseen by the Kyoto Protocol . #% As Mr Fantuzzi has pointed out , the Commission was concerned that the five-year transitional period is proving insufficient to register all the products which are seeking designation as protected regional products or foodstuffs . #% I support the rapporteur 's call for such a committee in his Amendment No 11 . #% There is a danger that unless action is taken now then both our environment and our energy security will be under threat . #% They have received death threats and extortion demands from illegal paramilitary forces engaged in negotiations with their employers , . #% Finally , I would also draw attention to the question of the legal base . #% It was essential that hearing protection should be taken into account , and I congratulate those industries and everybody else who convinced the rapporteur of the need to do so . #% I believe along with everybody else that this is in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights . #% We should not vote for lesser price cuts and increased compensation and less quota cuts than those proposed by the Commission . #% It is vital to remember that we must not produce a proposal that undermines access to credit . #% General Pinochet is to become a life senator after retiring as Commander-in-Chief in 1998 , although the Senate is already controlled by the right as the result of previous Pinochet appointees . #% Madam President , I rise on a point of order concerning my friend Roger Helmer . #% But it is not just about money ; it is about access ; it is about helicopters and other equipment to reach inaccessible areas . #% It is not a question of preventive medicine - it is of the other applications to which antibiotics are put , and wrongly , in my view . #% Where is there a sense in here that you are putting some real resources and priorities into sorting out the problems of the internal market ? #% All of this is good , as it simplifies and clarifies the administrative procedures in the proposal . #% However , for consistency ' s sake and with regard to the framework directive which is the basis of this whole legislative approach , I can not accept the others at present . #% In this regard it should not be possible for the party 's choice of applicable law to strip consumers of the protection afforded by the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which they are resident , provided that was the country in which they took steps to conclude the contract and expect it to be honoured . #% Is this a matter which is being given serious and active consideration by the President-inOffice , and have proposals along those lines been prepared ? #% I also welcome the timely decision taken on Monday by the EU Foreign Ministers to issue an ultimatum to Hamas to implement the Roadmap of face serious financial consequences . #% I visited Sri Lanka from 1-5 April and met Joe Green , the Commission representative out there , who was very helpful . #% Mr President , I should like to know whether you share my concern at the mawkish exhibition held in Parliament 's building in Brussels last week entitled `` We on death row '' . #% Mr President , in the UK there are no specific laws controlling the sale of supplements sold as food . #% On the issue of Frontex , I also wanted to say that I support the additional funding for Frontex - we doubled the funding for the Agency . #% In Mrs Fraisse 's speech she drew attention to the need for vision and coherence in cultural matters in the EU and particularly in the enlarged EU . #% Railways in Europe are in terminal decline , not least in the rail freight sector . #% That means voting against all the resolutions . #% It was interesting to listen to the earlier debate this evening , in the context of International Women 's Day , during which time after time speakers talked about the fact that there is no single definition of a family , that things are changing and moving on . #% I have said it before , and I will say it again . #% That is the second point . #% But this vote is typical of the EU : pretending to be transparent and putting in place more bureaucracy at taxpayers ' expense . #% In the brief time available , I would like to reflect on the period in which the financial perspective has been in operation . #% It is really time now to act decisively . #% The next three questions are all on the DASS . #% Abacha 's presidential candidacy from four out of five parties and the continued house arrest of Chief Abiola do not constitute a transition to civilian rule , Commissioner Marín . #% Mr President , in view of the fact that the Commission accepts our amendments in theory but rejects them in practice , which is an offence to this House , could I move , under Rule 60 ( 2 ) , that this matter be referred back to committee ? #% We are talking about fisheries partnership agreements with obligations on both sides . #% Then it goes on to signal some of the difficulties we have to overcome in this field in the future : the difficulties of the relationship between the WEU and the EU , not to say the difficulties that would arise if those two bodies were ever integrated . #% Given the impact of climate change , we must accept that extreme events will continue , and with increasing frequency . #% I would personally recommend that there be no vote at the end of such a debate , and indeed my own delegation would expect a free vote because it is a matter of conscience . #% Soon , not only will the last Commission and the last Parliament be defunct and expired , but so will the whole EU project -- and the sooner the better ! #% And can you guarantee us personally , that you are going to ensure that the questions that myself and other colleagues wanted to ask you today about the work of this group and the appointment of a new chairman are going to be answered quickly and correctly , in an open and transparent way ? #% It is clear that with the entry into force of Lisbon , we can go forward with a step change on the whole issue of transparency . #% In conclusion , while we are on the subject of fishing vessels - and I am sure Mr Kinnock will understand why I raise this - some French fishing vessels have been blocking the ports of Boulogne , Calais and Dunkirk , causing great inconvenience to many lorry drivers in my constituency . #% I am disappointed that the Commission drew back from an earlier draft of the SET Plan , where the sources of the identified necessary investment were clearly indicated . #% Mr McGowan is absolutely right in his report when he says that all that we hear about coordination is rhetoric and that coordination is not followed in practice . #% Although the ultimate responsibility for conformity with Community legislation belongs to Member States , the actual meeting of the requirements is largely tasked to other bodies , such as regional and local authorities and specialised agencies . #% In view of deconcentration we want to ensure there is a proper infrastructure in place for our delegations . #% But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation . #% The theme of this year 's budget has been job creation . #% It is quite clear that they would be prepared to go further , and if we press them they will go further . #% I am pleased also to see the inclusion of the applicant countries , together with Malta and Cyprus . #% There is a worldwide shortage of qualified and able seafarers . #% The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom . #% He stated in his letter -- when it finally arrived -- that ` hospitality is a normal fact of private life ' . #% I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse , worse enough for them to be singled out in the report . #% Those are just some of them , there are others . #% However , I am sure these problems will not occur in future . #% Is there a timetable , is there a target date for getting this directive agreed ? #% All these reports , particularly that of the Ombudsman , show the very reliable , dependable work that has been done over the year . #% Yet the same article of the decision stipulates that : ` in the event of special circumstances ' the position of the European Community ` may go beyond the ' . #% We have a financial services action plan , we have the implementation of 42 new directives and the burden on financial services is heavier than it was before . #% The introduction of Sharia law since 1999 has been particularly divisive and we have witnessed the imposition -- although not yet carried out -- of lapidation , or stoning to death sentences on women convicted of the so-called crime of adultery . #% The Americans complain that we will not allow Californian champagne , Californian claret , Californian sherry and so on to circulate freely here in the European Union - quite right too you might say , because after all these are special names which we all very much cherish . #% While pretending to be the Eurocrat 's foe , they are clearly , in fact , the Eurocrat 's friend . #% Europeans are deeply unhappy at the prospect of military commissions imposing the death penalty or unlimited detention for the Guantanamo Bay detainees , and at the way the US is trying to sabotage the International Criminal Court . #% 
I am pleased that you see , Commissioner , that independent competing dealers will continue to be the foundation of providing good quality sales and service for consumers . #% My action on Monday was therefore upholding the law , not breaking it . #% It is about the real sovereign debt crisis which we may face within the next few weeks , and which concerns the integrity of the European Central Bank itself . #% It is part of our feeling that the role of our committee is to continue to investigate , to promote and to make recommendations about the future evolution of the key legislations , the key building blocks of the single market . #% It is time to end that poverty of fatalism ; it is time to bring neglected diseases in from the cold and to bring real hope to those who live with and , too often , die from these diseases . #% We should also look at industrial fishing - and I know there are mixed views about this - in which sand eels are extracted from the sea bed . #% It will go through tomorrow . #% By setting down these new standards for air quality in our cities we can oblige industry to start to take the necessary measures to tackle the current sources that are causing the problems of air pollution within our cities . #% There seemed to be a good response from that point of view but we are relying on the experts , as you say . #% This misses two goals : giving them protection and catching the trafficking gangs . #% Mr President , this debate is at risk of becoming boring but I will operate on the principle that if you say something often enough and clearly enough you might get the same message through . #% Increasingly we are entering into dialogue with the United States and Japan about global technical standards for motor vehicles . #% Madam President , like Mr Stevenson I want to raise a point of order with regard to a matter of discourtesy to this House . #% Let us do more to put countries on the spot . #% Mr President , on 28 February in Brussels four Commissioners -- those responsible for enterprise , the environment , competition and energy -- presided over the first meeting of a high-level group to look at issues concerning energy , the environment and competitiveness . #% Pakistan is a large country with a proud people and a far too troubled history . #% Some carriers were exempt from attention and in the EU as a whole the discrepancies between the way different nation States treated this issue led to loopholes and weaknesses in what should be an area of cooperation and coordination . #% It will also deal with epidemiological studies to try and determine the situation finally . #% There is a real need to challenge this culture and to make violence against women unacceptable . #% It is perfectly clear that is what Mr Clarke and the UK Presidency intend to do . #% In her Amendments Nos 1 and 6 she rejects the word `` broadly '' and says that the Member States must actually agree to remain `` exactly '' within the emission ceilings . #% That is the real connection we are all striving to obtain with our citizens so there are thankfully new winds blowing through our legislative process . #% Those specific points should be specifically tackled by the Commission . #% I ask the House and I ask the Commission and the Council to proceed with caution . #% Mr Barroso , you can have as much supervision and surveillance as you like , as much economic governance as you like , but fundamentally , if countries like Greece and Ireland and Portugal are to remain within the eurozone , they need to become a lot more competitive , as competitive as Germany , and that is where your Commission should concentrate its efforts . #% We must also look at food imports from outside the European Union . #% Mr President , when we look at relations with the United States , we have to ask ourselves whether or not the United States is prepared to adhere to multilateral agreements . #% Therefore , we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , firstly I would like to pay tribute to the shadow rapporteurs and their group advisers for their useful input on this report . #% Madam Chairman , I rise with regard to an item on the agenda for Wednesday , 15 September . #% Ambiguity is evident in the cobbled-together text as to whether masters , as well as ordinary seafarers , are included in watch-keeping regulations . #% This is a crucial measure . #% The Commissioner will be aware that this Parliament supported the change to the financial regulation which should at least partly ease his path . #% I should like to raise two particular points , to which the Commissioner could perhaps respond in his winding-up statement . #% Tell me : who benefits from the destruction of the richest waters of Western Europe ? #% Mr President , an amendment which I with others tabled to this report called for confirmation of the dual nature of the Union in which nation states are the predominant component . #% The reality is that other Community central banks - notably the Swedish Riksbank , the Bank of England - do not have these concerns about money creation . #% Unfortunately , trade in services only accounts for about 25 % of world trade but has a potential to create so much more wealth and jobs . #% I should like to ask Mr Lamy if he would comment on the issue of marks of origin , and confirm that the proposals being considered by Commissioner Byrne to require ceramic articles coming into contact with food to bear traceability marks showing the factory that they are made in - to trace any problems with toxic materials that may be in the articles concerned - would not in any way contravene existing WTO obligations . #% As Mr Liikanen has said , everything done in the United Kingdom is in line with a proper legal framework . #% The Lisbon Treaty has therefore been a missed opportunity . #% I urge Parliament to reject this report and allow the committee to resolve it . #% Does anybody here want to have a bet with me that it will not be 12 years in a row , or perhaps 13 or 14 ? #% I have long thought that the EUR 100m we spend every year on the use of this building for one week a month is a terrible waste of resources . #% At this point I declare an interest as a professional engineer . #% Finally , given that much of defence expenditure is now in the aeronautical area , is there a likelihood of a spill-over of this research programme into the field of defence ? #% I would stress this : people have told me that this has nothing to do with work/life/family balance . #% Already their military wing is a classified terrorist organisation and their despicable and tragic policy of recruiting suicide bombers must be repeatedly and universally condemned by all . #% How are you going to make this work in practice ? #% In Britain the press have poked fun at it because it restricts bare-backed building workers . #% As the Chair said so revealingly during the committee vote , we are not dealing with reality . #% Firstly , a total budget of EUR 137 million is foreseen for 1999 under the Obnova Programme of which EUR 46 million has been committed and implementation is under way . #% I am delighted that she has taken this on board . #% There are red lines in the road . #% We have had many messages from the Czech authorities this week . #% I congratulate my colleagues . #% On the other hand she mentioned that in the interests of the local bodies , the Commission would be asking for changes . #% We have a farming industry which is in ruins , and we have Member States that are at odds once more because they are scrabbling around with directives and instructions that they can not properly understand , precisely because of the lack of harmonization that Commissioner Fischler referred to at the outset . #% However , at the moment it is banked with bankers , although Article 109c does not specify whether representatives should come from national banks or from economic and finance ministries . #% Bills will contain more basic information and consumers will be better informed of exactly what they are paying for . #% Far from leading to the lights going out , the Green amendments specifically called for the phase-out of SF-6 with the exception of switch gear . #% We support measures that protect individuals from exploitation at work . #% The intergovernmental panel on climate change has no doubt that there is global warming taking place and that greenhouse gases , in particular CO2 emissions , are largely responsible . #% It is very important that we get the basic building blocks of social dialogue in place in the applicant countries and we need to begin to channel resources in that direction . #% The response from all of us must be direct and urgent . #% I am not sure whether one day we will have the EP meeting the AP -- the African Parliament , including , of course , the Caribbean and Pacific -- but certainly we must play our part in sustaining and developing that African Parliament concept . #% 
We want sustainable agriculture in developing nations . #% The prime ministers and presidents must coordinate their campaigns . #% Without supplies , their health and their lives can be at risk . #% Let us be under no illusions : Zimbabwe is the test case for NEPAD . #% We want the member governments to monitor the application of public procurement rules better and to encourage local authorities to comply with them , because compliance with these new rules will be the test by which this proposal is finally judged . #% It is applied at a low threshold which will particularly affect PE funds by bringing small funds quickly under the directive when they have made just a small number of investments . #% There is one other point which I would have liked the President-in-Office to have raised , because it is something which I included in our original resolution , and that is the reference in paragraph 4 , seventh indent , to the need for us to study the best practice in the 15 Member States and elsewhere , particularly in the United States , to identify policies which can achieve results in bringing down unemployment . #% That is how we make progress . #% The fact that these proposals are being introduced to eliminate disadvantages created by the implementation of the GPA demonstrates how we are all intertwined . #% Firstly , we must beware of losing sight of the objectives of this directive beneath this welter of technical detail . #% On the ground , businesses find many of the European directives much too complicated ; in many cases there are inconsistencies between them . #% I do not want to smash the project . #% This is ridiculous . #% In any case , I agree with Alan Dershowitz , Harvard Professor of Law , when he argues that there exists a vast black hole in international law as regards combating terrorism , with categorisation of detainees anachronistic and the rules governing how such detainees are treated currently dangerously blurred . #% Several dozen legal residents of the EU are still incarcerated there , including some of my constituents : Bisha al-Rawi , Jamil al-Banna and Omar Deghayes . #% I say to Mr Canfin and others that there has been a huge amount of investment in time and resources , and indeed in systems like the points of single contact , in order to generate those jobs and growth , but they now have to come . #% We hope that the intensive consultations undertaken with the Secretaries-General and Presidents of this Parliament and of the other institutions will facilitate the support that is essential to the changes that are necessary to fulfil , I remind the House , the clear reform mandate given specifically to the Prodi Commission by this House and by the European Council . #% I would therefore ask that his vote be deleted . #% We must ceaselessly remind Mr Arafat that suicide bombings are not only morally repugnant but also that they stop us helping him to get a Palestinian State . #% You can see from those figures that it is extremely important that all Member States actually meet those objectives and I mean the nine-year objective . #% However , let us just note the successes : between 2005 and 2009 , the arrest warrant has secured the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers , child sex offenders , rapists and others . #% The affair of Mr van Buitenen was conducted completely in compliance with the existing Staff Regulations and however tested , I am sure that any fair-minded person is bound to come to that conclusion . #% Mr Schmitt spoke a lot about unjustified applications and , of course , we need to look at all applications properly . #% In my opinion , drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I sought to give these regulations the necessary flexibility to make them viable in three areas : in terms of enlargement , effective competition , and accountability . #% Such political tricks may secure short-term advantages but we should regret the fact that the peoples of Europe have hardly had their faith in their politicians enhanced by such cynical manoeuvres . #% However , my concern is not the work that he has done - for which I commend him very much - but rather , for example , the delays and problems that Member States are experiencing in transposing the electronic commerce directive , passed by this House with great speed . #% Whenever , in future , there is an explanatory statement which some in the House do not like we have established that every time we will be able to vote against if we wish to do so . #% What more does Israel want ? #% The knock-on effect that these events have had in Peshawar , Balochistan , Waziristan and Bajor illustrates the footholds that the extremists now have across many parts of the country . #% I look forward to the Austrian presidency . #% The problem needs to be addressed urgently in my opinion , with demographic pressures in recent years already generating deficits in the pay-as-you-go schemes in France , Germany , Italy and Spain . #% We have some five billion chickens in the EU . #% With this in mind , we produced a one-page resolution highlighting key areas . #% While Parliament is fully entitled to be aspirational , it is a mistake for us not to have focused our input into what the IGC is actually going to discuss and decide . #% There remains , as others have said , an extremely worrying reluctance on all sides to work together , to co-exist , to cooperate and to work for reconciliation . #% I believe it is in the best interests of the House 's reputation , the future of our international agreements and the security of Europe that we now give ourselves this time . #% At the moment all you are saying is that we have the chance to express Parliament 's views . #% We also thought it was important that the area of policy should be looked at as well , because one of the questions we often get is `` what is the context of a particular development going ahead ? '' , particularly where that is linked at times to European Union policy , such as CAP spending and spending on the Structural Funds . #% British Conservatives have consistently regarded the pursuit of an autonomous European security and defence policy as one of the most ill-advised policy ambitions of the European Union . #% Parliament shows itself to become far more capable and responsible for scrutinising and sustaining critically a strong executive authority . #% Indeed , I welcome Mrs Schörling 's report that we will be voting on in the plenary session in Strasbourg in a couple of weeks ' time . #% There is no mention of Parliament participating in the debates on 7 March . #% This is a serious matter , and these are the people we are stuck with , but the Euromed countries will not have to put up with the three amigos at all . #% Traditionally the majority Muslim population has lived peacefully with other religious minorities , and Bangladesh has a good record on education and civil rights for women . #% We welcome the further aid that is going to given in the form of food aid . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner might dwell on that point as well ? #% Earlier this year , we commissioned a report from the Association for the Conservation of Energy to assess how well this government has been implementing existing European laws on reducing fossil-fuel use . #% When he came before the committee the minister , Dr Cunningham , made it perfectly clear that the committee would be right to call him and that he would always attend . #% Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities . #% If we delay now , that will worsen , not ameliorate , economic downturns . #% I am very glad that interest in the Berlaymont building is spreading . #% SMEs are a part of that process and that is what this is about : attracting finance to try to generate those businesses . #% The report was withdrawn and referred back to committee in the light of other events . #% A major debate is now under way about consumer policy . #% We can treat this in a number of ways . #% Mr President , I too believe that size , shape and appearance of food are not the only criteria by which quality should be judged . #% What worries me is that , if this pandemic in Asia is tying up a lot of the efforts of such inspectors , where is the work not being done ? #% Madam President , you are absolutely right , there is no point pursuing the debate but there is a very easy solution to this . #% Many have lost their livelihoods and some have lost their lives . #% I would highlight a small printing company in Tilbury in Thurrock , S & S Printing , which finds by and large that it is working for other companies which are larger and more secure . #% In this week 's Economist Jeffrey Sachs , professor of international trade at Harvard , talks about the end of an era ( and I was surprised to hear Mr Brok blaming Harvard professors for what has happened ) . #% I wholeheartedly support the drive for improved compensation for national road traffic accidents , by obliging insurers to provide either an offer or a refusal of compensation within three months of receiving a claim . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent example of where a substantial and sensible proposal from the Commission has been further improved in our committee . #% That clear message should go out from this Parliament . #% I tabled the draft to try and deal with the problem of printer cartridges , many of which are not being recycled for anti-competitive reasons and are instead ending up in poisonous dumps in China . #% He said very poignantly that we were not going to allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture . #% 
Eurodac has to run hand in hand with the reform of the Dublin Convention and I am somewhat concerned at the attitude that the Council has adopted in the past . #% He has been to Togo twice : once , leading a delegation as Co-President of the ACP , and again , for the full session of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly , when he met the President , the Prime Minister , and representatives of all the main opposition parties . #% There is category three , which is fit for human consumption , including catering waste , and category two , which is all the rest . #% Again it would be a barrier to trade . #% Will we put in place fair and equitable access for developing countries ' exports ? #% I was absolutely astonished because I thought the Commissioner was going to reply to the debate and that we were going to hear other people speak . #% The Americans are still building a case against him and do not know what they can charge him with , if anything . #% Madam President , unlike the previous speaker I refuse to condemn so forcefully the government of Israel or the Israeli defence force in its operation on 29 September in Gaza to prevent Hamas -- an organisation banned by both the US and the EU -- from launching Qassam rockets which recently killed two Israeli children and wounded ten civilians in Sderot . #% The compromise we came to was only to exempt uses in closed industrial applications , for example , the manufacture of concrete blocks , concrete lintels or other products of that type . #% The ` producer-pays ' principle is paramount . #% Furthermore I do not see much evidence in the Commission 's work programme of the social agenda agreed at Nice last December . #% The EAS is to have a network of ` EU embassies ' and , under the watchful eye of the new EU High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission , is to be responsible for creating and implementing EU military and foreign policy . #% I am talking about only a very modest increase in the sums available , but this would send out a very big message to the European people . #% No government anywhere can tolerate civilian fatalities killed by a deadly and implacable enemy without reserving the right to retaliate with all the means at its disposal , and the Palestinian Authority has clearly not reined in its terrorists . #% Madam President , under Rule 111 of the European Parliament ' s Rules of Procedure , I propose an amendment to the agenda of this part-session to include a statement by the Commission about the French Government ' s refusal to lift the beef ban and its decision to stop UK beef crossing its territory , which is a vital route into Spain and Italy . #% That is an argument I would also put to those who complain that there is no reference to Christianity in the new Constitution . #% However , I should like to turn to one recital in the original directive and bend the Commissioner 's ear . #% New family patterns , new concepts of the role of men and women have emerged . #% The flagrant corruption and wealth of the ruling family elite contrasted sharply with the high levels of poverty and unemployment among ordinary people . #% And if we are really to encourage transnational consolidation , we have to look at the question of how pension funds are dealt with so that people are able to take their pensions with them when working within a single company structure . #% It is very unfortunate that their appeal fell on deaf ears , because China 's deflationary pressures are already driving down wages , pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers ' rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive . #% I am , however , a little cynical when I see references to the UN Human Rights Commission , whose current membership includes Saudi Arabia , which publicly beheads people for drug and alcohol offences ; Cuba , which executed three people last year for attempting to flee the country in a hijacked ferry and locks up political dissidents , and Zimbabwe , which is a dictatorship in which press freedom is suppressed and people are subject to arbitrary arrest and torture . #% It really is not good enough to expect us to debate when we do not have the amendments in our own language . #% The Lisbon policy mix of mutually supportive economic reform , full employment , social cohesion and sustainable development needs to be reinforced through concrete measures that increase the potential for growth and job creation . #% An exercise should perhaps be conducted in order to enumerate the number of occasions that is taking place with those Member States or with others to demonstrate that regional government can play a role in the European to bring our decisions closer to the citizen and to improve our decision-making . #% Secondly , I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States , and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion , Commissioner . #% Normally , as he knows , I am very supportive of what Mr Bolkestein does , but in this case I do not feel that the Commission has in any way justified to us the salary and status of the staff that it proposes to administer this work . #% It is no surprise , therefore , that the Nepalese authorities prevented Tibetan refugees living in Nepal from voting for a prime minister and a parliament in exile . #% I was disappointed particularly by the phrase that ` substantive errors affecting transaction underlying payments ' was in the same range as in previous years . #% We are concerned at the extension of the concept of human rights to include , for example , domestic violence , which is properly a matter to be handled under other legal instruments . #% Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency , consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties , especially when , as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate , Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors . #% The issues of the prospectuses directive which Parliament had to address could have been avoided if there had been sufficient cross-referencing with the risk capital action plan in the first place . #% However , like other colleagues , I urge the Commission to take action soon . #% This will ensure that the poorest people actually receive the aid . #% I must say I think most Members will think that a six-month delay is exceedingly disappointing , but it is nice to hear something positive . #% It follows that I also very much regret the amendments by the PPE Group , which again introduces that idea of using space for military applications . #% We know India is committed in this regard , but not all MEPs share that commitment . #% On all that we can be pleased . #% I wonder whether this is the worst-prepared presidency of my time in Parliament . #% In conclusion , it is up to you to provide leadership . #% I wear one hat as the rapporteur and reflect the wishes of the committee in the way it has voted and amended the original draft . #% For instance , we have the European arrest warrant but we still do not have the accompanying procedural guarantees for people facing charge and trial , which have long been promised . #% New freight goes by road in Europe , not by rail . #% I am sure that this House will join me in sending a message of condolence to their grieving families . #% In his introductory remarks , Mr Albertini said that this gives us a chance to outline our transport policy , bearing in mind the environment and fuel efficiency , something about which this Parliament has consistently felt very strongly and expressed its views . #% Mr President , this is obviously a very important issue that needs to be addressed with some urgency . #% I look forward to hearing your reply later on . #% This is an example of a piece of legislation and a report here in the European Parliament ensuring that we are seen at our best , in cooperation , focusing on the needs of the research industry . #% If you take the Commission proposal of EUR 50 million and reduce it by the same amount then you would be cutting health budgets to EUR 37 million in real terms when we are taking on these new responsibilities . #% Although the present government wishes to respect human rights , there are still many unresolved cases left over from the military dictatorship of General Pinochet which was responsible for over 3 , 000 officially recognized extrajudicial killings . #% Citizens will not accept an enlarged Europe if it is only going to give opportunities to corrupt officials , drug barons , gangsters and paedophiles . #% I have been in the forefront of those campaigning for human rights , democracy and the rule of law in countries such as Burma and Zimbabwe , where the re-election of President Mugabe last month and the political violence and intimidation that continued to accompany it , were a matter of great concern and make a mockery of international actions . #% The people who have been arrested are either senior members of the ousted government , human rights defenders or student and trade union leaders . #% Finally , I hope that the adoption of this report will send a very strong signal to the Greek authorities that they must amend their law so that it is in conformity with the EU directives that I have referred to . #% Phosphates are the trigger and often the clear cause of eutrification in many different waters across the European Union . #% The compromises we reach today will go some way towards doing that and make sure that everyone in our countries retires on a decent pension . #% The proposals also bring good news , not just for juvenile fish but for other vulnerable species such as dolphins , sea birds and sharks . #% Concerning the independence of the authorities , both the Commission and the Presidency have reaffirmed respect for the provisions of independence of the authorities , their chairs , executives and board members . #% I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it has to deal with this . #% Although my group is not unanimous in its view , we feel that overall , given the improvement in the common position from the original draft , the common position should be adopted unopposed . #% Madam President , 50 years on we have been celebrating over the last few years the end of the war , the founding of the United Nations , the founding of the World Health Organisation , the return of independence to the Baltic Nations from the Soviet Empire , but sadly also 50 years on we have to commemorate China 's illegal occupation of Tibet : fifty years of suppression and oppression of the Tibetan people by the Chinese regime . #% I have witnessed first hand the very casual attitude of many of the lorry drivers and their companies . #% I would like to think that a UN convention would also bring important resources to assist disabled people in their own empowerment and development in decision-making in order that their voice can be heard . #% The former , which was previously thought to be the bird most likely to become extinct in the United Kingdom within 15 years , is now doubling its numbers . #% Finally , again , do not allow cofinancing to be a renationalisation of the common agricultural policy . #% I hope not , because the Treaties also say that wages are an exclusive competence of the Member States . #% 
Despite the fact that during 2004 we had our European election and so things were more difficult , we managed with electronic communication to bring forth some effective reports . #% I believe strongly that the UK , as an island , occupies a unique position within the EU . #% The need for this work remains as strong as it did four years ago . #% The second key set of amendments deals with whether companies must annually update their prospectuses or whether , if they do not issue more bonds or shares , they do not have to do so . #% There must be a positive response . #% We are talking here about modernizing work organization and working patterns in the Union . #% Finally , can I say that Lord Stockton and I find ourselves in appropriate political parties in Great Britain . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , we are indeed fortunate , I suppose , to be talking about this at the time of the World Cup because what the World Cup illustrates more than almost any other sporting event is just how important sport is to people ; just how many millions and millions of people watch football and how much pleasure and passion is invested in it . #% I am grateful to the rapporteur for the way in which he has accommodated this . #% It would be disastrous for us to act recklessly and even worse for countries to consider themselves above an agreement which disciplines us all for the sake of a stable eurozone . #% Mr President , I am here today speaking on behalf of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , in particular my colleague , Mr Doorn , who has been the shadow rapporteur for the three successive reports that our hardworking rapporteur , Mr Medina Ortega , has produced . #% Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax . #% Let me suggest one way in which this Parliament could help . #% We will also be very carefully monitoring the number of assistants helping out Quaestors . #% There is no doubt that the scarcity and degradation of environmental resources will lead in the future to conflict and we have to use all the resources available to prevent that happening . #% We condemn the violence but we also see that black Zimbabweans have a compelling case . #% We do not disregard the case for some data retention for security practices , but we oppose its insertion in this directive because the huge implications both for industry and civil liberties are not adequately addressed in this context . #% He was also very capable and effective . #% It was only when you returned that you later found that it was actually avian flu . #% If the Council is unable , or unwilling , to be present to answer this oral question , I see little point in considering either the Treaty or the oral question . #% Mr President , I welcome the report of Mr Gasòliba and congratulate him on the content . #% There is no point in paying lip service to disabled people 's rights . #% They need to be tightened up quickly . #% We have all been impressed by your macho image , clearly learned from watching too many World Wrestling Federation bouts . #% Can I first of all also thank the rapporteur and the rapporteur from the Women 's Rights Committee , and indeed the Commission , for the work that they have done on this important issue . #% In 2004 , UKIP was the only British party to vote against the enlargement of the European Union , arguing that the free movement of goods and services is one thing , but to have the free movement of peoples between countries with vastly differing GDPs is nothing less than wholly irresponsible . #% Over a year ago , at the World Education Forum in Dakar , those same governments promised that no country serious about achieving education for all should fail for lack of resources . #% Mr President , we have to restore public confidence in aviation and we have to let the market decide what happens to the airlines themselves . #% I have no legal training whatsoever but I have no doubt , as the Commissioner mentioned in his comments on forging together the chemistry of 15 countries , that mutual cooperation across the legal systems and judicial processes of 15 countries is very difficult to achieve . #% The importance is no less than that . #% We make our case on the three areas of discussion and the Council then ignores everything . #% The Ombudsman found there had been maladministration and the Commission flatly refused to reverse the situation . #% I have worked very closely with her on this report from its very beginning when we were working on Regulation ( EC ) No 1049/2001 , and without her contribution we would not have this outstanding regulation . #% However , could you not take action more rapidly ? #% The work is to cover the years 2003 to 2005 , and we are already well into 2003 . #% Mr President , I particularly welcome the efforts of the Commission President , Romano Prodi , to set the contours of this debate , which follows on from our debates in January and February in this House . #% For those who seek democratic reforms , it is also clear that such courage/dissent is met with harassment and sometimes extreme violence . #% I look to the day that we will work , not only for greater equality in the workplace , but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals . #% We all understand that without the support of the pharmaceuticals industry there would be very few patients ' voices , but that voice does not come without a price . #% Of course we want to achieve stability in the European Union . #% Trafficking , domestic violence , sexual abuse and mutilation , rape , sexual harassment at work : all are forms of gender-based violence . #% Well , I can tell you that many of us in this Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group will do all we can to help the ` no ' side in that Irish referendum . #% I believe this House should reaffirm the Commission position . #% Some of the worst deprivation , the most severe needs and the biggest environmental challenges are indeed found in our towns and cities . #% They want to run their own affairs . #% I took that initiative because my constituents certainly do take seriously fraud against the Community , as Mrs Green said this morning . #% To come to the substance of the issue , on the budget it is completely unacceptable that the EU should be offering a budget cut in comparison to former years , particularly at this moment in our relationship with South Africa . #% In many ways justice delivered in this way is as valuable as financial assistance from the European Union . #% Mr President , according to Rule ... -- I do not know what number -- it is not permitted to be a salesman selling a commercial product in the Chamber of this House , which is what I believe Mr Wise has just been up to . #% The very worrying deterioration in the political situation in the last few days is just the latest twist in a story of consistent human rights abuses . #% The Commission welcomes the fact that international civil and military administrations have been established and have begun the very difficult task of rebuilding in Kosovo . #% There is an important onus on us tonight in this debate to ensure that we do not add to that rhetoric and that we identify the real barriers and real reasons why coordination is just not taking place . #% That is why tomorrow we will vote against those sections of the report which call for exceptional treatment for particular sectors . #% There is a need for clear rules consistently applied within national regulatory authorities and between regulatory authorities . #% One could see how that might be made a pretext . #% However , sadly , as shadow rapporteur I am unable to speak in support of many of Mr Ceyhun 's amendments , as I believe that these do not actually address the issue but could on the contrary have the effect of exacerbating it . #% Both showed an arrogant disregard for the ambitions and aspirations of ordinary people and eventually we shall be able to say that both failed . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Rehn for the serious way in which Bulgaria 's progress towards accession is being monitored . #% What war has it stopped ? #% We greatly welcome such opportunities to share views and ideas . #% I am a great Italophile and a friend of Alleanza nazionale and of Forza Italia in Parliament . #% For example , most of us would applaud the other sectoral initiative in this field , the FIN Net dealing with financial services for instance , but when was this initiative referred to Parliament ? #% We welcome the amendment from the rapporteur and Mrs Roure that keeps open the possibility of testing the human rights dimension of this in the courts . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I speak on behalf of the British Conservative Party , who will again this year vote against discharge of the budget . #% However , some NGOs experience difficulties in renting space and the control of funding . #% That is why we have to get this right . #% 
I should like to ask him three quick questions . #% I wish to draw attention to this in relation to the ultra-peripheral regions of the Union whose status has now been specifically recognised by Article 299 of the Treaty . #% Spanish Members from all parties have made important contributions to the work of this House , holding distinguished office in both Parliament and in our groups . #% Could the President-in-Office - in either his capacity as representative of the presidency or as representative of the Spanish government - give an example of any previous situation in world history where a policy of non-dialogue with people who are carrying out terrorist attacks in a country such as Spain has ever resolved the situation . #% Small - and medium-sized companies are already benefiting from it . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , one by one in Pakistan , the voices of reform and progress are being extinguished . #% Otherwise a country which murders its trade unionists will continue to appear to be rewarded for doing so . #% You rightly say that the precise makeup of the new government of the Palestine Authority areas will not be clear for some time , but it will undoubtedly reflect the new-found power of Hamas . #% We must allow no new conditions to be introduced . #% Does he agree with me that conscription is incompatible with a modern mobile force ? #% I tabled a few amendments for the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , some of which were accepted . #% The deal will underpin the euro - for what is a single currency if the markets on which it is traded are still divided by national barriers ? #% I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report and I would ask the Commissioner to ensure her own officials at future meetings of CCAMLR have this as a very high priority . #% Yet in some of the European Union Member States , there are health rules at points of access , in others the rules are very different , despite frequent cross-border transits . #% The approach of a public-private joint undertaking is still quite a new one and I hope that the Commission will be up-front and transparent on lessons learned from the Galileo joint undertaking . #% Mr President , can I just say how regrettable I found it that the House did not have the opportunity of hearing the sound advice of people like Danish anti-marketeers who had so much to say a couple of months ago to hidden cameras about how we should have sound and efficient management . #% As to the last point made by my colleague on the other side of the House about secrecy , I have not a single clue as to how my colleagues on this side of the House voted , because I did not choose to peer over their shoulders . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission here this afternoon . #% Naturally , we do not anticipate a final or complete agreement but we should aim for ` fine-tuning ' and no more during the Austrian presidency . #% This requirement could have imposed millions of pounds and euros ' worth of costs on businesses large and small across the European Union . #% However , we share the rapporteur 's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution . #% While voting in favour of the report as a whole , we decided to vote against paragraph 20 , which proposes the establishment of an permanent EU Operations Centre . #% The Environment Committee 's amendment makes it clear that it could be provided under the voluntary scheme where there is a demand . #% We can not accept the premise that it is the sole responsibility of those Member States . #% However , candidates must be subject to rigorous and exacting standards as laid out in the Copenhagen criteria . #% In a sense the proposal from the Commission had quite a faltering and uncertain start . #% We are clear that the agreement is a matter of mutual benefit . #% I would add that I am conscious of some of the waspish remarks made about what happens in my country . #% For this reason a single management database has been set up , covering all infringement files opened by the Commission and covering data on the transposal of directives by Member States . #% Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that , although the data are to be scientifically based , they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes . #% In other words , Mr Mitchell , we need to address ourselves to the question of the development of the single European market and whether it can have adverse effects on children , some of which are entirely unlooked for . #% Finally , I want to remind the Commissioner that we look forward to receiving similar rules for international rail , ferry and coach journeys soon . #% Therefore the IGC in Amsterdam is absolutely crucial so that we can return to the sort of agenda that people understand . #% The key question that the petitioners pose is this : does Lloyd 's have the reserves to cover their liabilities , as Directive 73/239/EEC requires ? #% It is vitally important that we should make proper provision for a mass influx of displaced persons of the kind we have had at least once in the last few years . #% Finally , I support the Committee on Development and Cooperation 's opinion that it would be useful if the European Commission could negotiate regional agreements to cover areas like Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , and so on . #% Perhaps the Council could come along and sign the resolution on value for money . #% Thus I did not vote on the Pittella report . #% That is something which we find reflected in the views not only of some of the German Members here tonight but also in some of my British colleagues . #% The first question is , what is reinsurance ? #% Although generous , the aid provided in these dedicated instruments -- in the case of the ENPI it is of the order of EUR 12 billion for the next financial perspective -- is less per capita than that granted in the pre-accession process to EU candidate countries . #% The UK Conservative delegation will be voting against it and we will not be alone . #% The Commissioner is right to say that consumers would be prepared to pay more for ` ethical food ' . #% We will see further progress in areas of open coordination , in employment - well established now - and the first steps in relation to social protection . #% Under delegated powers the Commission believes it will not make legislative papers available until adoption of the final text . #% I am very disappointed by what the Council has done . #% So , not only do young people see violence as such , they also see violence towards women and a portrayal of women that is not what we would wish . #% Huge advances are being made today in photovoltaic technology . #% So , in my opinion , we have to put our own House in order in this matter . #% Then we should not have to be dealing with this sort of technical work . #% Just tell the truth to the British public -- that is all we ask . #% I would make an exception if either were to compete , as nothing undermines dictators around the world as effectively as the world 's laughter . #% I therefore welcome this proposal but with certain reservations . #% I am pleased that there is a section devoted to the European Parliament this time . #% I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ? #% The British Delegation of the EPP-ED Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support . #% Commissioner Fischler spoke about third-country agreements . #% That is what has to be tackled if we are going to plug the skills gap that is bedevilling the whole labour market of Europe . #% We must have the resources , knowledge and personnel to react quickly . #% Put yourself in the position of a patent inspector , where you are having to make a judgement about whether to offer patents . #% But will this reduce congestion and emissions ? #% Now that raises all sorts of expectations and people will be looking for concrete progress in the coming months . #% But I contrast this discussion with the kind which one might have in a national parliament where , frankly , the issue itself is of such dramatic importance to the establishment of this role that it ought perhaps to be dealt with not in this particular plenary but elsewhere . #% I would like to ask you , Mr President : who voted for you ? #% Does the Minister agree that no matter how many years before Tibet regains its freedom , no European state should recognise the illegal actions by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of tens of thousands of non-Tibetan people into Amdo is illegal under international law ? #% Mr President , Prime Minister , regrettably it becomes clearer day by day that the present Constitutional Treaty will not be brought into force . #% 
What must also be sought is an agreed prioritization of the activities which has resonance within the professional , scientific and social communities . #% I would like to say that the compromise resolution tabled by my group and others has been cut down to the bare essentials to make it absolutely clear what we are calling for , but even so there seems to be a tremendous amount of confusion over exactly what we are calling for and I would therefore like to spell out two things that we are not calling for . #% However , given that the vast majority of Member States and the Council take this view or a stronger one in terms of the proposals , if we are to achieve any kind of agreement at first reading here there has to be an indication -- perhaps there already has been -- that we will follow that line . #% But today , and in the Citizens ' Rights Committee , we have had few real facts because of the secrecy . #% For certain , no business would ever operate like this . #% What we really want to see in Dublin is a target to tackle a manageable aspect of employment . #% Therefore , that is also an important point . #% This must now change quickly . #% Who took civilian hostages to negotiate with the regional governor ? #% I welcome the commitment of the Commission only to take this forward once Parliament has given its view and to explore these issues further in an inter-institutional working party . #% At the moment , the amount of timber that is illegally harvested and imported into the EU constitutes almost one fifth of the timber products on our markets , despite Parliament and others trying to tackle this . #% But the will is there and for that we should be very pleased . #% It is ridiculous that 50 % of our Community budget should be spent on a declining contribution to our GDP . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would like to share with you some extracts from the interim report of the UK Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations : ` we all need to adhere to the principal of continuous improvement . #% 1 ) We supported the repatriation of authority to member states and within that general statement where possible we supported the interests of SMEs #% We support measures outlined in this report including prosecuting those responsible for genocide and war crimes and other crimes mentioned in this report . #% We hope that the WTO will deliver a more just system , but in the meantime we need Fair Trade , with a capital ` F ' and a capital ` T ' . #% One main concern was with regard to the resources allocated to the various agencies and institutions that carry out statutory duties on our behalf or provide data and statistical information . #% Having looked at it , however , I think it does improve the text so , personally , I am in favour . #% Has the time come now for us to move on from dialogue and move into shared partnerships , overcoming perceived religious differences to tackle common human evils of poverty , ill health and illiteracy ? #% The European Union should be focusing its efforts on economic , administrative and humanitarian contributions to crisis management , to complement the military capabilities which should properly be a NATO responsibility . #% Mr President , this report claims that the Commission has a political responsibility to support ratification of the Constitution . #% There is no proof that this has been put before the committee despite repeated requests on our behalf . #% Therefore I would say that we have to look more particularly at processed waste from mines which often contains high levels of toxic chemicals . #% I find it staggering that the European Parliament forces us to be gagged in this way , without the appropriate committee being consulted . #% Seven thousand new soldiers drafted in since December ; one village I saw where there was one soldier for every family ; where the army sites its barracks illegally and , in many cases , in schools , driving the teachers away and depriving the children of their education ; repeated and extensive evidence of paramilitaries operating alongside the security forces , waging a dirty war against the civil population symbolized by the bloody massacre at Acteal where I heard that seven hours of bloodshed took place as the security forces stood doing nothing three hundred yards away ; vicious and unwarranted attacks on brave human rights defenders ; the Catholic priest accused of raping an old woman , of conducting black masses and of blessing arms when he and his colleagues simply seek to bring humanitarian aid across the lines of bitter division . #% Under Rule 35 ( 1 ) , for all Commission proposals of a legislative nature , the committee responsible shall verify the legal basis . #% Let us face it , many of the accession countries would find it very difficult to put into place the production-based subsidies we have . #% A further ECU 63m has been spent on research and administrative controls have cost a further ECU 43m . #% Steps have also been taken on the issues of liability , traceability and labelling . #% I look forward to Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot politicians sitting alongside us as parliamentarians in this Chamber and to the creation of a bi-zonal federal state . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's remarks and I endorse what he has just said . #% These are not the actions of democrats . #% Basically , it is about ensuring that the rights that we have are built upon , that they are not diminished , and about recognising that under Lisbon , it is no longer just the three institutions but all of the agencies and the bodies set up by them , including the European Central Bank , in some instances , the European Court of Justice , the European Investment Bank , Europol and Eurojust . #% The report put a number of questions to Council , many of which have not been answered . #% The Asian governments must realise that they may be sacrificing a rewarding partnership with the European Union for the sake of a morally bankrupt regime in Burma . #% There has been much hand-wringing in this Chamber today , saying , ` if only there were something more we could do as the EU ' . #% Well , of course , the plan was flawed and their fanciful monetary scheme collapsed . #% There should be no need to have a committee of inquiry . #% We are also committed to bolstering the Union 's power in international negotiations through an effective performance by the Commission . #% I would ask therefore that we see a bit more environmental mainstreaming . #% For example , if we take visitor accommodation in Luxembourg , France and Portugal , VAT is as low as 3 to 5.5 % , whereas , ironically , in two of the nations which are opting out of the euro - the United Kingdom and Denmark - the rates are 17.5 % and 25 % . #% Perhaps it is because they have fears of difficulties in verification and that the ban could allow countries such as North Korea and Iraq to conduct low-level tests , or perhaps they fear that by permanently halting testing the US could suffer a deterioration of its nuclear stock-pile and deterrent . #% The ELDR is also minded to support Amendments Nos 12 and 16 by Mr Hudghton and others on greater involvement by the fishing industry and on safety respectively . #% Whilst all proposals to improve WTO procedures are naturally welcome , there is a danger that we might be embarking on the reinvention of the wheel . #% They are the very foundation of the powers of this Parliament and they can not be blithely ignored . #% We need a health programme that forms part of a health strategy for the European Union . #% Syria and Libya , of all countries , have been offered trade concessions and even subsidies to be paid for by us , but where are the safeguards on human rights ? #% I was very pleased then that companies in the United Kingdom had taken a very positive lead in that . #% Would he not share my view that this is the sort of bold proposal we want to see ? #% After all , the EIB is already active in Russia , where I , of course , welcome Mr Berlusconi 's interest and engagement . #% How can we hope to have a competitive , dynamic economy when Member States today have substantial proportions of illiteracy , huge inequalities in linguistic capacity , protectionism and discrepancies in occupational and educational qualifications , and numerous financial and legal barriers to mobility . #% Only a small proportion of that tax revenue is spent on improving transport . #% With 2004 very much in mind , it is vital that we address the issues of slow response and delays to the implementation of the existing TENs projects . #% That is why I shall be voting against this report . #% I do not support amendments which would seek to add further conditionality to Bulgaria 's membership application . #% I was told in the past that they were signed whilst that person was in post . #% Large sums need to be invested in warning mechanisms , risk maps and public awareness campaigns to ensure our citizens are aware of the risks . #% A lot has been done ; it is not suggested that Member States are not giving this top priority . #% Let us now prove these critics wrong and vote for the conciliation . #% Nevertheless , the fact that we are on the verge of agreeing a historic code of conduct on arms exports , which I hope will be agreed on 25 May , is a hopeful sign for all those seeking a safer world . #% I very much support this because the low pathogen form has the potential to mutate into the highly pathogenic form of the disease , which is highly contagious and fatal for poultry . #% The region I represent , the East Midlands , has the largest cluster of clothing companies in the United Kingdom and has the second largest clothing and textile industry in Europe . #% We all know that ten thousand people a year in Europe are killed in drink-related crashes . #% I believe there are potential savings to be found in things like the buildings policy and in terms of enlargement - which the Commissioner has mentioned himself - but also in things like the proposed cost of a non-European office , which I believe at this time is an unaffordable luxury . #% It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed . #% 
And finally , might I draw attention to the fact that , although we could not formally record this , we have said that we will put a standard clause into directives that will simply say `` Member States undertake to have in place , by the date of entry into force of the directive , systems of environmental inspection which will enable them fully to comply with the provisions of this directive '' . #% I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the colleagues who have contributed to this report and those who helped me in industry and in the Commission to make sure that we covered the ground thoroughly . #% I also want to record my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to support our work with time , information and explanation . #% I want to be both controversial and constructive . #% As part of that restructuring , the aspects of market intervention contained in this directive - and this is very strong market intervention at a retail price level - are clearly set out . #% That is the key issue here , rather than trying to favour our industry . #% Mr Helmer has reminded us of what Mr Blair said in this House . #% This is one of the main arguments in favour of a European satellite system given that the American GPS system is a military project which the US Government can jam at any moment . #% Thank you for that very exhaustive , full and explanatory statement , Commissioner . #% Collaborative technological projects have a dubious track record . #% We need to feed into that process and be flexible , but we also need to be active . #% The likelihood is that if we leave it as a recommendation somebody in five years time or so may or may not remember to report to the European Parliament that a recommendation was passed and that very little was done about it . #% We welcome the proposed visit by Solana , Patten and the Presidency . #% We will vote on them this week but it will be to all intents and purposes a formality . #% We should make it clear that we want this exemption to apply only to debt securities , so that they would not , for example , be able to undertake a privatisation without a prospectus , and therefore insert the word `` debt '' at the beginning of the compromise on No. 65 . #% I commend this proposal to the House . #% There are international organisations -- one of which is the International Civil Aviation Organization -- that regulate the industry at a global level . #% I appreciate the Commissioner 's response . #% It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak . #% Although all the States concerned are signatories to our Human Rights Convention , I have nevertheless asked in this report that we draw particular attention to the need to protect and preserve human rights in the conduct of these teams . #% It is the Commission 's job to drive that forward . #% Words mean nothing . #% I am one of the few engineers in Parliament , certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers , and can put a rather different point of view sometimes . #% Since then , Madagascar has been troubled by unstable governments with threats of secession and impeachment punctuating a rough politics . #% However , the Treaty is silent on what should happen if Parliament refuses discharge . #% In short , we have in front of us today for our approval the toughest GMO legislation in the world , so tough , in fact , that some natural foods in common use today would not pass through this procedure . #% On page 8 it concludes that CAP expenditure was still materially affected by errors . #% What we have in Yugoslavia , is not peace but an absence of war and we are currently hoping that in the absence of war the communities will start to live with each other again . #% On top of that I would also want assurances that it will be properly accountable through parliamentary control . #% If you speak to the players , whether they be Asian , Polynesian or Melanesian , they will say they want to play , of course . #% However , Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm on our committee now have to determine what will constitute the global ramassage for this year . #% How would you feel if you were the captain of a ship and you have a navigating officer joining you who is a lieutenant commander and a female ? #% Madam President , we have heard time and time again in this debate how citizens across Europe are calling for the highest priority to be accorded to the fight against fraud . #% I have to say that all the signs are that there is a danger of Kazakhstan slipping into authoritarianism . #% I hope Parliament will lend its strong support to the agreement in Wednesday 's plenary vote . #% There are 350 million people in the European Union at the moment and there will soon be 500 million . #% But he had no proposals at all for controlling small arms . #% We have just heard from a leading French socialist the sort of words I might use myself . #% Let me conclude by saying that this debate is partly one of myth against reality . #% Not because we necessarily disagree with the Scientific Committee on the issue of whether radiation can be safe for foodstuffs , but because it is not the whole story . #% Given modern transport systems , we should all be aware of the potential problems . #% By the end of this year , it is quite likely that over 25 million people will be unemployed . #% Mr President , I have to say that I fully respect the sincerity and the passion of those who find themselves opposed to this report . #% We have had several meetings at which many organisations and individuals have presented evidence that confirms me in my judgement that this special committee was very necessary . #% I can hardly think of legislation more likely to cause concern to some manufacturers than that which indicates in such detail how they will make their products and what minimum standards of energy they must achieve , with lots of detailed specifications still to come , appliance-by-appliance , determined by the comitology procedure and very much out of the public gaze . #% For some time , going back to the SARS epidemic three years ago , Taiwan has attempted to gain observer status in the World Health Organisation . #% If we reverse that message now we run the risk of undermining all the reforms which have taken place at great pain in Central and Eastern Europe . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the reply , but I am rather disappointed that he was not able to give me more specific details about the number of proposals that they had been consulted on . #% This House must back the Commissioner 100 % as he makes the case to the Council for a negotiating mandate to deliver bilateral FTAs , opening markets and securing fairer trading conditions in new areas of growth throughout Asia . #% Up to yesterday , he had not had a reply . #% After all , once EMU is fully established there will still be finance ministers in the euroland countries . #% That technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage . #% How is it that in Papua six members of the army 's special forces are now accused of involvement in the assassination of a Papuan leader ? #% I therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets . #% Atrocities grow , they do not diminish . #% We also criticise the ambition about being the most competitive knowledge-based economy , on the basis that in any competition , there are going to be losers , both within the European Union and globally . #% What will the lead time for an effective monovalent vaccine stockpile be ? #% The other substantive point about this set of proposals from the Commission is made both in the explanatory statement of the report and in the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . #% She says that she supports bringing forward in the future a comprehensive disability non-discrimination directive . #% I hope that the authorities here can seek some explanation for these actions . #% At the moment we have a lot of ad-hoc initiatives , often coming from Presidencies , on this or that condition . #% This is our great neighbour to the east . #% That is something that , having listened to the debate on the Procedures Directive earlier , some of our Members would do well to remember : the majority of people are moving within North Africa . #% I note that Commissioner Borg disagreed with me in my last speech , saying that the problem was over-fishing , which is precisely what I said in my own comments . #% Hopefully we will see signs of a more democratic Europe as a result of these last few months . #% Indeed , by increasing the scope of what constitutes racist behaviour , to include actions that may be deemed threatening , abusive or insulting , this resolution represents a consolidation of the principles of freedom and human rights , principles upon which the EU and its Member States are founded . #% 
This debate has raised in particular the issue of the freedom of the press in Tunisia . #% It is most important , therefore , that Bulgaria 's progress and accession should not in any way be linked to or held back by any other candidate country . #% After all , it is not just a question of animal welfare , it is also a question of the spread of disease . #% We support the principle as I have described it , but one or two unfortunate elements seem to have crept in . #% Even in Kurdistan we see Turkish troops at the moment massing on the borders there , undermining the possibility of return to destroyed villages and undermining efforts to increase economic stability in that area . #% I welcome the positive steps that have been taken by CEPOL 's new Director , Ferenc Bánfi , and hope that the cooperation between the Committee on Budgetary Control and the College continues , and big steps are taken to ensure the College is run efficiently and in line with all financial rules . #% However , a lorry from Birmingham takes much longer to reach the target . #% These are well documented by organisations such as Amnesty and the US Department of State in its 1999 Country Report . #% We have to participate in those as fully as we are able and with all the contacts that we have in order to find a way forward , so that we can get on with distributing the tsunami aid properly and look to a peaceful future for all . #% I hope it will come up with fresh proposals where necessary , but in an open and transparent way . #% Three quarters of the US contribution to the package is military assistance ; only 6 % will focus on human rights and only 4 % will be put towards helping displaced people . #% Is it the case that the Commission stands ready when necessary to give administrative support in the formulation of suitable programmes , as they did in the past when I wrote a report on the Alfama and Mouraria areas of Lisbon ? #% I very much support their proposals to have stronger representation of the European Parliament at the IGC . #% Mr President , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that , if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , we can not afford to let the NATO-ISAF military mission in Afghanistan fail . #% I know that the problems , particularly in regard to rail freight , but not exclusively in that area , lie firmly at the door of Council . #% I must admit the more I heard the more convinced I became that biomass offers an enormous opportunity for us to produce environmentally friendly energy that can be used in the whole of Europe for the betterment of our environment and our society . #% I seek the assistance of the President and of all our colleagues in this Hemicycle . #% This is the only European patenting directive and today we have opened a Pandora 's Box which our children and our children 's children will deeply regret . #% There are many other proposals . #% Let me turn to the contentious issue of the A-30 lines . #% The fact is that all our countries need to generate more military capability and the willingness to use it in concert with America and other allies , along with other instruments . #% Thirdly , technical assistance . #% However , we do not see the measures in this Report as being helpful and its resource implications in offering free legal assistance , regardless of the merits of a case , to anyone who wishes to pursue an action are both naïve and totally impractical . #% Second , when he was constructively dismissed from his position as vice-president of the management committee of the Monitoring Centre through administrative harassment by sections of the current Austrian government . #% A contract that , for example , pays a substantial sum if , say , the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls , causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , this memorandum requires an EUR 1 per hour reduction in the minimum wage in Ireland and a review , as we have heard , of the system of collective pay agreements which protect the low paid . #% Thus it is now clear that the proposal should not imply the mandatory EU-wide introduction of toll systems . #% Mr President , a number of Members have expressed concern about the humanitarian situation in Iraq . #% The arguments have been won . #% Indeed , Nato itself needs reform , in particular with regard to military restructuring . #% Essentially it concerns the pace at which we will be able to open a full and proper debate on the standards for a single MHP , were we to have one . #% Furthermore , there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland . #% In tough economic times like these , volunteering becomes all the more important and that is why I and others who brought this report forward are keen not only to raise awareness of the benefits of volunteering , but also to create a European Year where properly-funded initiatives will provide volunteering organisations the opportunity to encourage new volunteers to come forward . #% We criticise Turkey over the Additional Protocol - we have heard the same again this afternoon from the Presidency-in-Office - yet no mention is made of the failure to implement the EU Council decision of 26 April 2004 . #% I asked it last summer why it is insisting on the use of Nordic gold in the new euro rather than nickel ; the day after the committee discussed it , the Commission admitted to me that it had absolutely no medical evidence to show that nickel is a particular problem for the large proportion of the population , as it seems to be claiming in its document . #% Mr President , I am delighted to see that both the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur accepted that it was unwise to reopen a large number of issues in this area and that much of what was achieved in the common position reflects a balance on this very complicated problem . #% All I can say is that we have often accused the Palestinians of missing opportunities ; we have often accused the Israelis of missing opportunities . #% The question of cosmetics now appears to have been resolved and we can express ourselves satisfied with that agreement . #% We have to think again . #% Mr President , it is pleasing and encouraging that under the Luxembourg presidency we have seen some serious attention given to progress in the area of judicial and home affairs . #% Until recently , Member States have had to contend with and fight against such problems in virtual isolation . #% But the rapporteur is correct in calling for the common strategy to have real substance and the means for implementing it . #% I would ask the sessional services to verify in future that such amendments really are in the name of a group . #% I am quite confident that the steady progress in this area will continue under the forthcoming British presidency . #% My only criticism is that Amendments Nos 4 and 5 should have been tabled in someone else 's name for the PPE Group . #% That begs a few questions about how we are deciding what we wish to invest in , with whom we are wishing to compete , and for what purpose . #% That is why we came up with a compromise in committee . #% Former President Ben Ali paid the supreme price for failing to meet the expectations and aspirations of his people , but I do not agree with some assessments , particularly in the Green Group , that his government was one of the most repressive in the Arab world . #% The Commissioner complains that the G-77 is insisting on the Global Solidarity Pact . #% We should , however , thank Mrs Isler Béguin for starting the work , and certainly our chairman Mr Hatzidakis for finishing it , so we can have that debate here today . #% Thank you , Mr President , and good luck to the interpreters ! #% Well , I find this interesting , when I have been negotiating this afternoon with her group , the EPP , on their draft motion for a resolution on the oral question . #% I welcome the proposed increase in funding to enable its greater involvement , as I do the criteria outlined in Amendment 53 , which makes clear the need for independence from industry , commercial and business interests . #% There will also be greater cross-border judicial cooperation , including mutual recognition of court decisions in all EU countries . #% Maybe , just maybe , there is at last some movement in the right direction . #% Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law . #% The IMO route is perhaps a better one , but we are not prepared for a study that may be published in 2004 - who knows ? #% The Commission should be prepared to give a clear signal to the Council : take the decision in June for accession on 1 January 2007 ; take the decision in December , in the light of further progress by the Bulgarian authorities and in cooperation with them , on any monitoring and other safeguard measures that may be necessary . #% I am very pleased that he has actually ensured that the final piece of the TENs jigsaw has been put in its rightful place . #% People were asking whether veterinary inspections were secure and safe and could possible be self-policed . #% We must demonstrably treat others as we wish our own citizens to be treated . #% Poor access to healthcare and any form of exploitation of women are matters that should be addressed by Member States in public policy development . #% This is politically if not technically an unbalanced situation which merits the attention of this House . #% Regrettably though , some people involved in the debate -- not just the one this afternoon , but also others -- are trying to assign all the blame to one side or the other . #% Why , after all , should the EU listen to experts ? #% 
It is a wish to try to remedy this discontent that lies behind Mr Napolitano 's report , which we in the PPE-DE Group support . #% It is yet another reaction to the French and Dutch public rejecting unequivocally both the draft Constitutional Treaty and further integration . #% However , surely it comes down to political will to cut road and air traffic . #% Maximum pressure must now be exerted on the KDP to keep Saddam 's agents out , to protect NGO workers and to provide the freedom for all and facilitate new elections . #% I hope that the Commissioner will give consideration to the points that have already been raised , because this is an example where , both in the definition and in the funding of universal service , the citizens of Europe can derive some very real value in their own personal , domestic and business lives from what is coming out of the European Union . #% He can quote the interinstitutional agreement chapter and verse , but I have been glad of it on many occasions . #% With the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union , I would strongly advise the applicant Member States to start creating supportive measures for their young farmers already at present , especially in view of the introduction of production controls required by the Commission . #% We should never forget that the so-called new media , the Information Society , is a double-edged sword where children are concerned : it is a valuable information and learning resource but can also expose them to detrimental information . #% If you look at small organisations with just a few employees and tight profit margins it is much more difficult for those companies to make the significant investment in research that will come more easily to the bigger players . #% In 2010 , as a result of the AIFM Directive , one in four hedge funds left the City of London . #% I can not think of a single person on this planet who has more direct responsibility for coming up with solutions to try and take the world forward , to try and take the economic block and therefore the world with it . #% Their accession is already secured . #% I think that this proposal reflects no credit on the European Union or on this House . #% The common position which has now been arrived at contributes to the clarity of the text , particularly where it deals with third-country nationals . #% We in our group will pursue this over the next few months . #% author . - Mr President , can I start by saying that it is very good to see Commissioner Wallström in the room , as well as Cecilia Malmström , from the Presidency-in-Office , because we were both engaged in this dossier from the outset , in 1999 . #% Therefore , to those who are concerned about the windfall profits of oil companies , I would say perhaps we should be more concerned about the windfall profits of finance ministers or the tax man . #% For that reason , I consider the compromise arrived at by the Council -- regarding the possible extension of self-inspection to areas such as pork and veal -- to be a dangerous one . #% I wish to remind colleagues that any common position on foreign policy would be determined by the Member States represented in the Council , not by the Commission , and certainly not by this Parliament . #% We must not endanger the lives of European or American troops without that agreement . #% Even foreigners or people with dual nationality were not accorded their just rights and many European citizens were woefully ill-treated and some killed . #% Madam President , I want to raise an issue on the floor of the House which I am sure will be welcomed . #% Mr President , I would like us to cast our minds back to September 11 2001 . #% I have discussed with Mrs Napoletano and others the necessity to delete paragraph 15 . #% Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one of the expressed intentions of the current review of the treaties is to bring Europe closer to its peoples . #% Mr President , I think this outgoing presidency should be named the Blair presidency in honour of a very great Englishman . #% Even the name of this report allows people to understand the nature of necessary , but often complicated , regulatory changes . #% Can we ask the Bureau to look into this fact . #% If we get this right -- and I think the Commission is getting it right , but we need more information -- we will do a very good job for promoting the European Union . #% Here it is essential that developed and undeveloped countries be separated and that these funds are not for European countries alone . #% What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication , which is important , and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits . #% Certainly we have much to do in my own country , the UK . #% The fruit and vegetable problems are great . #% in writing . - I welcome the positive elements of the 2011 budget , which include funding for economic development in Wales , support for research and development , and overseas aid . #% To fly the Union flag upside-down is an internationally recognised distress signal and to fly it upside-down when it is not a distress signal is a gross affront to the flag , the British people and the British nation . #% I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent , but that was a symbol of the 20th century . #% LDCs are set to lose EUR 783 million of potential earnings in the first year alone . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I was not fortunate enough to be on the Parliament delegation in Cancún , but I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone who was involved . #% Similarly , on Nigeria , will the Council give us a commitment that it will implement the measures already agreed in the common position , particularly on visas , which have been regularly flouted by generals ? #% This is an important issue and one we shall pursue in Mali . #% This resolution is an appeal to President Ramos and his government fully to maintain the policy of land reform against all opposition and to ensure also that these disappearances are fully investigated . #% In view of these aspects , my group considers this communication a disappointing one . #% It is very much a traditional socialist agenda . #% In my own region , we have in Bracknell the world-renowned medium-range weather forecasting centre . #% One hopes that this is a wise decision . #% I suggest , with the exception of some English county councils and the BBC economics correspondents , virtually nobody . #% If they have , would this not be an abuse of their position ? #% We believe that all Member States should now be prepared to join in precisely the same preventive measures which have already been implemented in the United Kingdom . #% But quite frankly we can not expect , having already given industry one set of rules to implement only a year or two ago , to hand them a completely new set of rules so quickly . #% In the context of that and of my question , which I notice the President-in-Office did not refer to , would he now welcome the decision which has now taken place in Scotland through the referendum to support a Scottish Parliament ? #% What Africa needs in particular is respect for the rule of law , respect for contract law and the protection of private property . #% At times we have done things with which I did not agree . #% Without the United States the burden will fall on Japan , Germany , the United Kingdom , France , Canada and Australia . #% Having said that , I have discharged my duty as the coordinator . #% That remains as true today as when it was first said . #% I was due to speak in one of those debates yesterday , as I know other people were . #% That is one question . #% Obviously they do not like the ` spy in the sky ' . #% It is clearly the dominant , political and economic force in southern Africa and I am concerned about the effect of an agreement - I hope that this is borne in mind - on surrounding states , in particular Namibia and its fishing industry . #% Secondly , efficient implementation will obviously be of crucial importance . #% I would oppose a deferral until Brussels . #% Five hundred thousand people each year fall from heights . #% Do we wish to be responsible for making small businesses go under because we are putting this compulsory liability on them ? #% We as a Parliament have banned all demonstrations outside the hemicycle . #% At least we are past the age where sexual orientation was seen as a mental disorder , but there is still , as others have said , a tremendous amount of work to be done . #% I take my job seriously and I am sure all my colleagues have also come here to work , not to treat this place as a club , but to actually do their jobs as elected representatives . #% 
Many voluntary organisations have already expressed their worries to me that such a measure , unless we get it exactly right , could well prove more of a hindrance than a help to their activities . #% The odd thing of course , in Britain ' s case , is that harmonised energy taxation on fuel duties would also probably reduce our taxes . #% I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately , largely because of those amendments , my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report . #% Then they protested . #% Mr President , during the debate on common security and defence policy there was a roll call vote on Amendment No 36 . #% We should be moving forward together by cooperating , but of course that is not the approach , is it ? #% I will try again . #% This is an issue we can not ignore . #% As has been referred to , this will not be viewed easily or lightly accepted by the Council because we have wrongly broadened the scope . #% The way in which the trial was conducted was unacceptable and it was thanks to the intervention of the Council of Europe that a retrial was held . #% Governments already use the most sophisticated means to monitor national and international communications . #% Indeed he has used the very words Gordon Brown used when he attended the Economic Committee : ' no plans to revisit this issue ' , he said , and I hope that the Presidency will long stick to that . #% Yet all this is to fund Spanish and Portuguese fishermen , giving them a licence to pillage Third World waters , often in flagrant disregard of the basic principles of fisheries conservation . #% There is a debate going on - and the Commissioner knows perfectly well about this - about parallel imports and whether these are now being used in some cases in a way which is damaging to trade , anti-competitive and against the interests of the consumer . #% We need to be able to tell the public , as consumers , much more forcefully why it is that meat from vaccinated animals is safe to eat . #% Today their only exports are raw materials and military hardware . #% Above all we want to see fair and even-handed implementation of any measures that are agreed upon . #% We must recognise the desperate plight of the Palestinian people , so many of them abandoned by their Arab brethren in refugee camps for generations , prey to extremists , so often lacking the quality of leadership at crucial moments that would help release them from their misery . #% Every EU citizen has the right to a fair trial and should be deemed innocent until proven guilty . #% At the same time , if Ukraine is not to be torn apart between east and west , rural and urban , President Yushchenko must seek to build bridges , not with the deeply flawed politicians that preceded him , but with the constituencies that they represent . #% I am worried about the European Union being left behind by the pace of change and I think climate change initiatives and our ability to tackle global warming offer great opportunities . #% Energy efficiency is vital for cutting carbon emissions , enhancing security of supply and boosting economic efficiency . #% At present the average claim processed abroad can take up to eight years and cost at least 15 % more than a claim processed in one 's Member State . #% We have spent billions on security of food supplies via the CAP , yet nothing on security of energy supplies , leaving the prospect that Europe 's future would be , in a crisis , eating raw vegetables in the dark . #% Obviously , concerns about state intervention are of the highest ranking but , given the nature of the damage caused by under-consumption and a shrinking manufacturing base , some relief at the level of government expenditure is necessary . #% I would ask for a formal acknowledgement for the first time that under Article 49 of the Treaty they are entitled to apply for eventual EU membership . #% I know that many of the new Member States think that Mr Blair is behaving like Ebenezer Scrooge . #% I think you should refer the whole matter to the next Bureau as you wisely suggested and see what the Bureau suggest . #% Reports of the House of Lords , that we all talk about , are reports of House of Lords ' committees : they are not voted on and rewritten by the chamber of the House of Lords , they stand on their own merits - often very good , deep , analytical reports . #% The ELDR Group would regret that because we think that , like refugees , beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should be in . #% We do not yet have that policy in place . #% Let us stop exploiting these poor countries and encourage them to modernise their industries . #% To take it up to 6.5 % would only encourage the catching and finning of more and more sharks . #% A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change . #% The sessional services should get themselves better organised . #% Mr President , I produced the opinion for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at first reading and I would like to raise two specific points that still arise from that opinion . #% The Commission came forward with a perfectly sensible communication - a discussion paper - with its options of the current EU list , plus shrimps and frogs ' legs , of the current wider Member States ' list , or of the current EU list alone . #% This is a business-to-business directive as well . #% It is by no means absolved , but the faults are not entirely on one side . #% - I wholeheartedly support Ewa Klamt ' s report on the fight against child exploitation . #% Let us look at effectiveness . #% That will take place in due course . #% It is as necessary for food producers as for the general public . #% Regarding the amendments , I urge colleagues to vote against Amendment No 21 from the Liberals . #% It is true that people in Europe want to see greater cooperation between Member States to combat and defeat the threats we all face in the modern world -- particularly terrorism -- but I want to see more intergovernmental coordination in tackling crime and terrorism , rather than trying to make such issues the subject of qualified majority voting . #% In addition the energy efficiency and environmentally-friendly technology of the Berlaymont , together with a design that will restrain technical maintenance costs , will bring further savings . #% I will mention two of the most troublesome , the first being the negative list in the negotiations on trade liberalisation . #% In Europe we must do much more to recruit and retain health professionals through training , through pay , through working conditions , through research facilities and so on , but with developing countries we must do so much more and above all we must stop this recruitment rape of their skills . #% They were certainly not rich people but they had a sustainable price , they had a long-term contract for their product . #% Mr President , it is always helpful to have a debate before our first reading of the budget with the Council later this month , but the resolutions in front of us from Mr Podestà and Mr Färm highlight a substantive contradiction , at least for me and for my group . #% No-one denies that there are important issues of concern relating to Turkey and these are well dealt with by compromises in the text in the Eurlings report . #% This draft convention known as the Brussels II Convention applies to civil proceedings with divorce , legal separation and marriage annulments and civil proceedings relating to parental responsibility over a child of both spouses . #% But this regulation should recognize the practical measures which are required if the EU 's policy of joint responsibility for the drugs problem is to be realized : respect for genuine cultural differences , an anti-poverty focus and a framework of fair trade can succeed where repressive measures have failed . #% I would therefore urge you , Commissioner , to be bold in your proposals and to press ahead . #% We must take action against all countries that manufacture , sell or use them . #% It will give confidence that , whatever the challenges ahead for economic and monetary union , the European Union can surmount them , and it shows that Parliament is a serious and responsible legislature and partner in economic reform . #% That is why we believe that the financial framework resulting from the negotiations must be considered as a minimum amount , not a maximum amount . #% Firstly the Commission has failed to deal with the issue of the 12 to 14 million third-country nationals living legally in the Union who currently suffer discrimination and , outside the Union 's island States can move freely de facto but can not do so legally , which of course creates situations in which they are exploited and used in illegal ways . #% Copenhagen reunited Europe 13 years after the Berlin Wall came down and 21 years to the day after martial law was imposed in Poland and already these things feel as if they belong to a different age . #% The importance of working at heights and having this directive is clear also . #% Mr President , I too would like to explore the transatlantic mergers of the stock exchanges . #% I thank the Commissioner for giving me information on the ILO and various other organisations and activity which is already in the public domain . #% We must work to end that in a sensible way . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I enjoyed Mr Barroso 's view of the world today , but it was perhaps rather more ironic than he had intended . #% Finally , there is yet another aspect of this tragedy which we must not forget . #% TRIPS currently dictates a patent term of 20 years world-wide . #% 
But I would ask the Conference of Presidents , in the interests of fair and balanced reporting , to issue an invitation to the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister of Israel , so that we can hear the other side of the story . #% I visited Iran . #% Secondly , as regards Parliament , there is the rapporteur . #% Again , please answer very specifically whether you are going to put pressure on the United States Government to shut down Guantánamo Bay . #% Conservatives have always believed that we should be taxed at the same rate as our UK constituents ( article 12 , point 3 ) , that our salary is equal to that of our colleagues in Westminster ( article 29 , points 1 and 2 ) , and to ensure that travel expenses are only reimbursed for the actual amount incurred ( article 20 , point 2 ) . #% I wish to draw attention to two parts of the world : firstly , Central Asia . #% Do they do so on grounds of cost ? #% The three proposals effectively need to be seen together in relation to the one proposal I am speaking on . #% I am very grateful to the President-in-Office for that very positive reply because I know that the British Government has made this a priority for its six months . #% Mr President , I am sorry that my giving way to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten seems to have caused her some anguish but I do not think she is any need of any blood products . #% The industrial groups affected are offshore workers in the oil and gas industries , the fishing industry , transport workers such as inland waterway workers , airline pilots and their crews , and railway workers . #% The costs of not enlarging are far greater than the costs of enlarging . #% Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria . #% In a way this is the end of the first phase of our cycle of work and , as the Commissioner said , we are now moving on to looking at further details of how to make the interinstitutional agreement work effectively . #% That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so-called prisoners ' document . #% The difference was only three or four votes . #% Mr President , I am sorry that most of those who sought to stop this debate did not bother to stay to hear it . #% Mr Argyros ' report and Mr Herman 's comments on regulation raised a question we come back to over and over again , namely whether existing regulatory arrangements are going to be adequate in the newly liberalized telecommunications market . #% I am delighted that the Commission is joining with us in Parliament to call for natural radiation to be taken out , and for the temporary workers directive to be looked at . #% Frankly , a lot of the delays are caused by the inefficiencies of some of the airlines themselves . #% Mr Goodwill said that these measures have unintended consequences . #% We will be voting within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament not on a party political basis but on the objective basis of the hearings and the questions that we had answered over the last couple of weeks . #% I disagree with the Commission proposal on the idea of a 12-hour rest on a lorry , especially if it concerns sheep . #% The situation there is desperate and deteriorating . #% Mr President , I would not deny that Transnistria is a very important issue , but it merits a debate in this House on Tuesday or Wednesday . #% As regards the right to safe patient mobility , the Commissioner has said that he is bringing forward proposals in that area which we look forward to receiving . #% We have to remember that the MAGP policies were introduced in the beginning to balance the European Union 's domestic fleets and fishing effort to the European Union waters fishing opportunities . #% So , what does the CSTEE say about this ? #% Now , on a personal level I have great respect for the rapporteurs of these three reports , but the philosophy which underpins the reports has been put forward at many elections and mostly voted down . #% It is important to emphasise the crucial role that this particular piece of improved legislation will play in our overall strategy for the internal market . #% There is no recognition of this in the Galeote Quecedo report . #% That is why there are sometimes disappointments at the end of the presidency . #% So could the Commissioner suggest ways in which Mr Pérez Royo could help towards that freedom of movement as required by the Treaties , and reduce those tensions ? #% We must tighten up procedures and we will monitor them both through the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% The pendulum had to swing back in favour of the consumer to a more reasonable , balanced position . #% We can not afford to have these massive collapses in confidence in our food . #% It is a problem and there is no easy solution . #% Firstly , there is at least a question mark over whether now is the right time , politically , to be advancing a policy of what is essentially a bilateral free trade area . #% We have not had enough time to question Commissioners ; we have not had enough time to follow up with an interrogatory process . #% It was difficult for me to imagine that countries that were not even Members of the Union when the single currency was adopted would themselves introduce the euro before the UK . #% It is in its worst condition , ever . #% We found out , as one of my colleagues put it , that the process was perfect . #% The same is true of the police service , and the British police take seriously any allegations of malpractice or racism by police officers . #% However , what is one to make suddenly of all these euro-fanatics -- especially down there -- and the CDU in Germany , and even the great President Chirac himself , whose ardour for the European Union 's endless development suddenly cools when they reach the Bosphorus ? #% Yes , Mr Schmitt , some of them are just escaping poverty , but we should not knock them for that . #% The Member , in his role as Labour 's European Affairs spokesman , should have understood the sensitivities in this case . #% My colleagues in UKIP and I will not be supporting the ratification of the Constitution or this shameful report , which admits the true problem but is designed to overcome it by propaganda and lies . #% I understand that the Council is anxious to reduce the amount of money being made available for this project . #% We need them all around the table and we can not apportion blame beforehand . #% However , I am against it . #% The good news is that voting for Amendment 28 will solve all those problems . #% Finally , I welcome the wisdom of the rapporteur and I congratulate him strongly on his report . #% Member States could be doing that now ; if they were really committed , they would get on with it . #% I am not sure that the largely one-sided tone of this Chamber is at all helpful . #% If I may speak on behalf of the UK once again , we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the Fiscalis programme over the last few years . #% I should like to return to the issue of Burundi , which my question addressed . #% I served in the Convention following the Laeken Declaration , which I much supported , a Convention which drafted the original constitutional text . #% He said that it would be a priority for the British presidency . #% Like him , I welcome the Commission proposal to reform the battery cage system . #% That would be a welcome step forward . #% Therefore , what does the Palestinian unity government have to do now ? #% The issue of the place of the Tamils in Sri Lanka is a long-standing problem dating back to at least the year of independence in 1948 . #% Worrying too , lest Hun Sen unwarrantedly uses international aid for domestic treason law to move against some of his current political opponents . #% It is essential to point out that different growth trends exist within the different national components of the euro zone economy , and that this implies different sustainable wage growth rates over time . #% This was most recently and clearly evident in a synthesis report produced by the WHO and the UN Economic Commission for Europe in January of last year . #% These figures are insignificant compared with the EUR 6 000 per head by which the single market has benefited its citizens through extra growth . #% 
Xu Wenli , one of the founders of the CDP , was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998 , along with two other prominent democracy campaigners . #% Mr President , this is the second time today that we are going round a course dictated to us by two simple facts : one , the extension and expansion of the Community , which means that custom and practice in different Member States have to be accommodated , and secondly the pace of technological change . #% I was the beneficiary of the Commissioner 's wisdom and he had a small advantage of my money which otherwise would not have occurred . #% The report also - and this is perhaps its greatest contribution to the debate - shows the way in which the WTO has to be placed increasingly in a context of other public policy priorities and other multilateral organisations and agreements . #% We also wish to see the consumer voice integrated into European Union policy-making procedures . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , what is the most commonly used word in association with the euro ? #% We look forward to the legal opinion and we look forward to greater involvement for Parliament so that in future this will not be an issue . #% Over those 15 years , the average budget implementation is , remarkably , 1 % of GDP . #% When we are clear that we have agreement then we should push very hard to reconstruct Kosovo and , in particular , deal with the question of refugees and displaced persons . #% Madam President , I am sure we will all support the aims and principles of these reports . #% Intellectual property rights must also be adhered to with the use of trademarks and patents . #% If we let Saddam carry on in the way that he is , then what message does this send to others of malign intent ? #% My supplementary question to the Commissioner is : given recent maritime disasters off the Spanish coast , and indeed in the English Channel , does she agree with me that it is only a matter of time before a passenger ferry and a rogue oil tanker collide , with devastating environmental and indeed human consequences ? #% I should again like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for her consistent approach to transparency and openness . #% That is why I have consistently proposed the idea of a ten-year waiver to cover the current trade arrangements , so I am very pleased that the Rocard report has taken up this point . #% Yet the average lifespan has fallen from 48 in 1990 to 45 in 1997 ; infant mortality is 125 per 1 000 live births ; one in eight babies dies in the first year ; 4 000 women die in childbirth every year . #% So you know that my praise is genuine because sometimes I do not hesitate to criticise . #% Mr President , as some colleagues may know , I live in Cumbria at the heart of last year 's foot and mouth outbreak . #% In order to investigate anti-dumping complaints , the Commission has to come to a view on whether there is injury to the European Community cause . #% I recognise that Mr Barroso comes from the centre right and that he is an Atlanticist . #% Therefore , we need to ensure that girls in particular have equal access at least to educational advantage . #% What role will we play in the global summit meeting that President Clinton has proposed ? #% Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that the precautionary principle has to be the right approach . #% They are the wrong way round . #% The joint employment report from the Commission for 2002 reported that only four Member States have put in place fully-fledged national active ageing strategies . #% The European Parliament must be kept constantly informed on the state of play of the deployment of these systems . #% We are really pleased that you have taken the initiative to move it forward . #% More of a relationship with provincial politics will improve the quality of our supranational democracy . #% Still on the subject of topical and urgent debate , regarding the `` Human rights '' section , I have received three requests to replace the sub-item on `` Hooliganism '' : a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to replace this item with a new sub-item entitled `` Outbreaks of racism in Germany and the killing of Alberto Adriano '' , a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists to replace this sub-item by one entitled `` Incidents at the Rotterdam football stadium '' , and a request from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to replace this sub-item by one entitled `` Desecration of Prague ' s oldest Jewish cemetery '' . #% So how do we provide the democratic legitimacy when we are all involved ? #% We have made concessions including a full month ' s delay on the implementation of the second phase of this proposal already . #% I see no reason why ultimately travellers on board ship should not have the same levels of protection as those that travel by train or plane . #% We see products on sale claiming to be free from animal testing when the manufacturers know perfectly well that the products may not have been tested on animals , but that the ingredients were . #% So there will be a common holding company under US jurisdiction , but Euronext would not register as a US exchange and would not offer its products on the US market . #% Madam President , it is clearly true that there have been developments this weekend but it is too soon to tell what they will amount to . #% The final text also contains quite hopeful language on the special products and on the special safeguard mechanisms . #% I would also draw their attention to the website mentioned , set up under the Europe Direct initiative , which could provide useful information and possibly avoid the need for a petition or indeed confirm it as an appropriate vehicle . #% In conclusion , the Socialist Group is pleased to support these measures because they will create a new fast-track system , where bus and coach services can be operated for the good of the bus companies themselves , the passengers , the economy and the environment . #% I really want to address my remarks on the two reports before us today to the question of those micro companies . #% I believe that we have to keep faith with our citizens and not add to the alienation which many of them feel and which they have expressed in recent weeks . #% However , much to his credit , President Putin has listened to the objections and asked to rewrite aspects of the bill which infringe fundamental human rights and which are not legitimately necessary to fight terrorism , as was mentioned in Chechnya in particular , and money laundering . #% I would note , however , that in far too many countries in the world the demonstration on 4 December of tens of thousands of people in favour of such universal suffrage would not have been permitted . #% Sadly , to date , only Romania has ratified the Protocol . #% Zimbabweans are starving , 12.6 million are in need of food aid , and the strikes and demonstrations which have been taking place are evidence of the failure of the international community to act effectively against Mugabe . #% They are of course rebelling against the Vienna and the Geneva Convention , and indeed his own proposal , by adopting their own symbol of European unity . #% The Member States will also be asked to put in place a framework for more adaptable forms of contract , taking into account increasingly diverse forms of employment . #% However , I want to make it clear that I think he has been an extremely effective and cooperative Commissioner and that he respected this House . #% I presented six amendments at second reading , which refer in particular to the action plan that stemmed from the Nice Summit , which it is important to refer to because it clarifies many of the points that we wanted to raise . #% Where we can add value to sports we should , but we should only intervene upon the request of the sporting governing bodies where we can clearly deliver value or give clarity . #% I believe that with the Two-State Solution the international community has now established the basis for a lasting and durable peace . #% I would like to reflect on what my colleague , Mr Medina Ortega , said on the way in which we adopt decisions and the way in which regulation is developed and promoted within the European institutions . #% Mr President , let us not kid ourselves . #% Time is running out for the peace process and that is why we need to maintain our pressure on those responsible for the murder and cover-up because , unless we resolve this issue , the peace process will fail completely . #% On the subject of migration of workers , many of our countries , not least the United Kingdom , have seen the consequences of a decade and more of failed and catastrophic immigration policies , largely unrelated to the European Union . #% Lithuanian progress has also been remarkable , but less impressive , in the field of nuclear energy , privatisation , institution-building , the judiciary and the establishment of a system of standards and certification . #% We then table amendments when we do not know what the effect of those amendments will be . #% They were saying ` no ' , particularly to Turkey . #% All these issues are absolutely integral to the relationship between civil justice and the internal market . #% But please , rapporteur , please , Commissioner , do not inflict such concepts on the rest of us . #% These chemicals pose particular risks to both human health and animal and plant life - particularly aquatic life - and therefore this dovetails well as the final piece of the jigsaw in the Water Framework Directive . #% That is why I will be voting for it : to be realistic , to accept society as it is ; to be modernistic in our approach ; and to be outward-looking . #% A very large - and growing - part of the transatlantic relationship is about issues of justice , law enforcement and human rights . #% However , in those ten years the EU has been criticised for failing to put its human rights tools in the field of external relations into practice and it has become increasingly apparent that when dealing with key countries , strategic partnerships and double standards of still eclipse the fundamental human rights which this clause seeks to protect . #% We have a better relationship with the Commission where we meet regularly with Commissioner De Silguy . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner to answer as to whether or not his services have talked to the other shipbuilders and what effect he feels the subsidy will have on jobs in the other Member States ? #% Indeed , in the road transport sector , agreement has been reached for the inclusion of all non-mobile workers . #% 
We should not be discussing pay . #% Surely one of the questions coming out of the recent events is whether the President of the Commission should have the right to dismiss individual members of the Commission . #% It is not the fault of Mr Schnellhardt that this remained locked in committee for some time . #% There are two other items of greater concern which relate to the way in which the administration responds to the demands and consultation of parliamentarians . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , this debate is a result of the implementation of the common immigration and asylum system enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty . #% Many of the answers to that question are being teased out inside the Convention , but it is certainly up to the European Council and not the president , Valéry Giscard d'Estaing , to decide just how far and how fast Member States are prepared to project the Union 's experience in parliamentary democracy to the east and the south . #% We should also have clear rules on the issue of stem cell research , including embryonic stem cells but excluding cloning for human reproduction . #% Far earlier than anticipated , I am being proved right . #% There is a separation here between the law of the contract and the external insolvency law , because it is quite important to ensure that parties , though they may choose the law of contract , may not actually choose their own insolvency law . #% If these were to be excluded , the entire directive would be undermined by those who choose to bank in certain preferential tax havens . #% In this Parliament , we agree with many of the principles enunciated by the Spanish Presidency in terms of further reform , and I would like to join with my friend Mrs Andrikiento say that it will be a further death blow to the Council if Iran , with its devastating human rights record , is elected unopposed next time , as some fear . #% I would be most grateful if the Commissioner could comment on these issues and clarify the situation , particularly with regard to trade with Cuba . #% Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children ? #% If it could be implemented it would end the evils of global speculation that destroy so many jobs , communities and families , while promoting a good in the form of large amounts of aid and assistance to the Third World . #% The EU will need to look again at its engagement with Ukraine , at least in terms of quality , if not in terms of quantity . #% However , they do want a Europe of diversity , a Europe where the different cultures and ways of life combine , where added value can be achieved . #% I started work there in 1967 when it employed 25 000 people , and now I walked into an empty factory . #% This situation is getting worse . #% If positive rhetoric could be converted into orders and cash in the bank , then the Union 's SMEs would be in great shape . #% Despite all the difficulties , hope succeeded over cynicism . #% I have not accused Mr Barroso or any of the Commissioners of any wrongdoing , but it is a case of Caesar 's wife ; it is a case that you have to be seen to be above suspicion . #% We have always said that each country should be judged on its merits and has to meet the standards or we will vote not to admit them . #% If it does not do it now , hopefully it will do so under the German Presidency . #% Perhaps that is why Mr Poettering is looking a little pale , perhaps it is overwork . #% The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs are meeting today and I sincerely hope that they will come to the conclusion that visa restrictions are no longer necessary for Romanian citizens . #% The original Commission text should be upgraded and tightened up to ensure a more ambitious strategy for countering this mountain of discarded packaging materials . #% Another practical problem is that too many of these witnesses have come forward at the same meeting , so there has been very little time to interrogate them . #% But we can not do that overnight . #% It is best to go for a five-year period , which is the same as the mandates of the Commission and of the European Parliament , because looking too far in the future would be an abuse of the democratic process . #% There are many different ideas around and different experiences to draw upon , not just in the European Union . #% I wish we had that within our European Union . #% We put forward the suggestion of creating a separate budget line for strengthening cooperation on nuclear safety in northern parts of Europe . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done so far . #% I can vouch for some satisfaction with that . #% There must be better accountability and transparency in the spending of appropriations by all the EU institutions and a commitment by Member States to account adequately for all expenditure on EU programmes . ' #% Mr President , I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler what exactly he is doing here . #% This is a first reading which can result in instant agreement between the three institutions if we all accept that none of the three have been pushed beyond their limits . #% However , two thirds of Member States have introduced explicit grounds for refusal : violation of fundamental rights . #% The President-in-Office has answered my question about how undercutting can be prevented in Europe between EU Member States when they are selling arms to a third country , but perhaps the President-in-Office would like to consider the question of end use which has often created problems in the past in tracing the eventual recipient country . #% I am amazed that with just a month to go before it comes to an end , the UK Presidency is still talking about agendas , strategies and timetables . #% For example , although in theory at least China has strict laws when it comes to what is in its rule books , in practice those laws are flouted time and again . #% We must take hold of the initial agreement in the form of the memorandum of understanding and develop it further at the G7 . #% Mr Rocard is trying to remove non-technical features of computer-controlled inventions from the scope of the directive . #% That would mean an end to some duplication of resources between two of the directorates and it would put a greater onus on the Member States to contribute 50 % , instead of 20 % of the cost of this project . #% I say in conclusion to Mr Bartenstein -- and I am still wearing my Austrian tie , because I told him I would wear it for as long as we were in sight of a clear agreement -- he can still get this on the table of the economic summit in March if he puts his mind to it . #% What the report does not say is that the delay in these programmes specifically harms localities and regions which are suffering real economic problems , for example in industrial sectors or in new and different ways , but who are not eligible for other forms of European assistance . #% In Taiwan , as the resolution itself states , there has been a recent reform in the penal code abolishing the mandatory death penalty for various violent crimes , while the Minister of Justice has stated that this is the first step towards abolishing capital punishment within the next three years . #% But pork was sold , was processed and has been eaten by humans and of course MPA in humans can cause infertility . #% Although there are many here who wish to forget that , the French and Dutch voted ` no ' in their referendums . #% Mr President , I am pleased to be the first to congratulate our rapporteur on putting together a package for the budget for 2003 for our Parliament . #% But despite lip service to open consultation in the past , the Nice IGC process , like Amsterdam and Maastricht before it , was ultimately the preserve of national civil servants negotiating behind closed doors . #% I oppose a pan-European supervisor because it would have too much power . #% I am sorry that we did not have the benefit of hearing these in Parliament this morning , but we will judge them in part on how much British taxpayers will have to pay for their government 's mishandling of the issues and on whether there is any evidence that the Prime Minister has received any solid and bankable commitments on fundamental reform in Europe . #% in writing . - Labour MEPs would like to express our deep commitment to the aim of a world free of nuclear weapons . #% We are now left stranded in Strasbourg until Parliament finds the political will to exert its own best interests and remove itself to Brussels with the odd symbolic sojourn in Strasbourg for formal occasions . #% The Abattoirs Directive left the Commission as a twelve-page document , was reduced by the French to a manageable seven pages and expanded by the British to an unreadable ninety-five pages . #% The whole report has been referred back . #% The Iranian regime can not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons . #% Secondly , in the special case of European Community companies filing their accounts in U.S. GAAP on a regulated exchange in a third country , they will be able to defer implementation of the relevant provisions of this Regulation until 2007 as opposed to 2005 . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office and Sir Leon Brittan not only for their excellent presentations this afternoon but for the real commitment that has been shown by the Commission and the Council to deepening the relationship with the United States of America . #% The annual economic report does not call for one . #% They are putting it into franchising and other things . #% The Commission did this in spite of the fact that Israel had the signed agreement of the Palestinian Authority that Israel was responsible for customs matters for goods exported from the settlements . #% Mrs Malmström is already in dialogue with the Commission on that and , frankly , we should have waited for the outcome of that before changing procedure . #% We know too that the transitional National Development Trust which is responsible for working with NGOs in South Africa only received its first tranche of money on 24 June . #% Thirdly , heading 5 of the financial perspective provides budgetary means for all institutions . #% 
The Court found that only Scotland and Ireland had clear land registers and this allowed the definition to be checked . #% That is , however , if we do not include enlargement , potential problems with Iraq later on or activity-based budgeting . #% I agree with those people who have regretted that the whole debate has been hijacked into an entirely irrelevant consideration about duty-free . #% Today the United Nations has called for Guantanámo Bay to be closed and there are many human rights questions hanging over what the Americans are doing in Guantanámo Bay . #% However , the absolute priority for groups concerned with such sea mammal deaths in the south-west of England and many other parts of the country is to put a stop to indiscriminate pair trawling in the English Channel as soon as possible . #% We have all been very frustrated by what has happened , not least the actions of the Israeli Government which , following its election , did not appear to feel itself committed to the peace process . #% Is the President aware that this Parliament has had a previous clash with the Council and the Commission on a similar point , when we were insisting on an objective study of safety for users of superbikes . #% Why the devil should we support Aer Lingus when Ryanair can make money without any difficulties at all - like Easyjet , like GO , like Buzz ? #% In rich countries , anti-retroviral therapies are extending the lives of significant numbers of people in wealthy nations . #% That is not only a problem to me conceptually , but it drives a coach and horses through the whole idea of a quota system that is there to be respected . #% There has been broad based cross-party support in Parliament for this proposal because it is based on our EU experience and values . #% There have been allegations of corruption for centuries in Pakistan . #% Is it not time for us to look at a new model of development within the European Union ? #% I find the budget laid aside for the nonsensical tracking backwards and forwards from Brussels to Strasbourg almost impossible to support . #% I feel strongly that we must encourage countries and their leaders who are not totally beyond the pale to move in the right direction and reward them for it . #% We all know what this is about : it is an attempt to undermine by creeping resolution our one-China policy -- a perfectly reasonable political position , which I do not happen to support . #% They hold high office in Colombo , the present foreign minister is Tamil , the country ' s leading businessmen are Tamil , so are judges , doctors , lawyers and cabinet ministers - the list goes on . #% We should have kept both sides guessing in order to keep up the pressure . #% Madam President , a tired driver is a dangerous driver , irrespective of employment status ; we should not make road travel any more of a gamble than it already is . #% Colleagues around the House will know that is all too typical at customs points all around Europe . #% There is a lot of grey hair in this Chamber -- not on me , of course . #% There have been large demonstrations in Malaysia , and in the European Parliament we must speak out clearly in favour of the release of Mr Anwar Ibrahim and his colleagues and all political prisoners , and the abolition of laws which deny the right of free speech or other basic rights . #% The Commission is also pressing for improvement in the transparency of the situation in Aceh and continues to call , as honourable Members have , for access to Aceh for international agencies and relevant non-governmental humanitarian organisations . #% Mr President , all the very valuable reports before us tonight deal with agreements and treaties on how best to regulate and control fishing in national and international waters at a time when there are very considerable concerns about over fishing and reduction of fish-stocks . #% There are 12 pages in this resolution and it adds very little , either to our knowledge or our capabilities . #% The petition claims that the United Kingdom Government has not properly applied the EU insurance directives . #% There are Members here who still believe that chemicals of high concern should continue to be sold even when safer substitutes are readily available . #% Last month 's violence was a reminder of the inherent instability of Albanian politics . #% That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue , maybe , of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel . #% In the same way , we learned much from seeing the desertification of the Niger ; or the implementation of the vaccine fund on the ground in Mali , where we could see the people who are most affected actually benefiting from the work being done . #% This seems to be a typically European solution , rather an elegant one , which only applies in future and therefore has no budgetary implications here and now . #% It is wonderful to see so much text being cut out of a report , and I support him strongly . #% I can not believe that the Council is taking on board the proposals from Ecofin in the budgetary area . #% I am afraid not and this is an important point . #% A key reason for this decline is that , in contrast to aviation and road haulage , a single market does not exist in this sector . #% Her contribution is fundamental to what we seek to do . #% Alternative means that almost replace the lower end of our traditional court systems will be introduced . #% Really , if you read that into this report , I suggest that you go back and have another read of it . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Well , Mr Barroso , I enjoyed that enormously ! #% What may be less customary is that in congratulating Mr Spencer I actually mean it , because previous chairmen of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy have produced the annual report on a very absolutist basis : they have talked about the world they would like to see rather than the world that exists . #% That is why we need a new set of rules for the European Union : a new Constitution to replace the current constitutional order and the set of overlapping Treaties . #% We have also seen concessions over a separate planning headquarters for autonomous EU operations , which will play into the hands of isolationist US strands who will be happy to see Europeans go it alone as they question the need to keep the US tied into NATO , an organisation which in my view has served us well for so long . #% The devil is in the details . #% This is a blow that they just can not cope with . #% Secondly , I condemn the resistance of some Member States to our positive proposals to put our environmental concerns at the very heart of the trans-European network guidance . #% It reflects public opinion , it respects much scientific opinion and it is the only humane and acceptable approach . #% The marketing and advertising of services , the claims and boasts of providers , must be checked against the need to allay the fears of risk to consumers , to safeguard their purchases and exchanges by electronic means . #% Allied to that , I see the rapid rise of political extremism , of nasty nationalism , of blind nationalism ; it is Euro nationalism and it knows no bounds . #% Can the Commissioner now take this opportunity to say why the Commission changed its mind - on the basis of which scientific studies ? #% The German economy contracted 5 % and EU trade much more so . #% For these reasons , we have abstained on this report . #% We are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in Cancun . #% A complete ban , in my view , would be a disproportionate response . #% That patentability has stimulated investment to develop those inventions into products that the world wants to buy . #% How Hong Kong handles that will be a key to the continuing success of ` one country , two systems ' . #% We will want to try to rebuild the former Yugoslavia . #% The report that we have before us today is a very good example of what precisely has happened . #% It is not enough just to set targets whether for young people , women , the long-term unemployed etc. , and then sit back and watch . #% In the meantime , we call on Iran to cease the persecution and prosecution of journalists and writers for views which do not threaten public order , or national security , but only the vested interests of conservatives . #% Mr President , I should like to draw attention to the deplorable situation of migrant workers in the Union and the legal limbo they often find themselves in . #% How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ? #% The report describes the effect of the dumping of milk on Jamaica and the dumping of beef on West Africa . #% Under the third pillar , bribery within the European Union is a criminal offence . #% Amnesty International have produced , in February this year , a report entitled ` The wrongful detention of asylum seeker Raghbir Singh ' . #% Over the past few weeks the most horrific crimes have been committed against Timorese and others , and those responsible must be brought to justice . #% It is not widely known that the strategy for dealing with that disaster was managed by the then Commissioner for Agriculture , and what a complete pig 's breakfast he made of that . #% 
The time to act is now . #% We therefore welcome the albeit belated common position adopted by the General Affairs Council . #% Mr President , I am pleased to be here tonight in order to correct some of the misunderstandings regarding this question . #% ... in answer to an earlier question . #% These should include : oversight of national pledges by the ICC ; guarantees that the US will investigate and prosecute its own nationals accused of committing ICC crimes ; a requirement on the US to update federal laws to ensure that its courts exercise jurisdiction over all ICC crimes - which is not the case at the moment ; agreement to confine the scope to military personnel or closely allied civilian personnel - and not , for instance , mercenaries ; inclusion of a sunset clause and the submission of the agreements for scrutiny by the relevant national parliaments . #% As a result , we are now promised a document for the PDB 2004 setting out how we are going to eliminate abnormal outstanding commitments by the end of 2003 . #% But I will tell you one thing , colleagues : you will not have an interinstitutional agreement and war will have been declared as far as the budget goes for 2004 . #% We must make sure that sufficient resources and measures are available in this respect . #% However , it gave the impression that the guarantee was only for Members of this House . #% However , the real reason is not to make them more effective , but to further the EU 's policy of regionalisation of Member States . #% My Group will press this cause until it is achieved . #% These are essentially national responsibilities , national budgets . #% By the way , Mr Kerr , the Conservative Group remains as it was yesterday . #% We must stick to the timescale that we have set ourselves . #% Second , in relation to paragraph 3 , whilst reiterating our strong desire on progress in relation to Cyprus , we point out that this has never been made a direct precondition for Turkish EU accession - and it is wrong to change that in this resolution . #% That is a fact , but no one has been prosecuted or held accountable for his death . #% It must surely be remiss of us to pass over the importance of countries like Malaysia and Indonesia in today 's world . #% I wonder if we could move it up the agenda in some way . #% We have to be aware when criticising China that we ought to be looking at ourselves . #% Mr. President , I also wish to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman on this second success . #% The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets . #% The issue before us today is : who decides ? #% However , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me . #% Whatever the budget , the European project is stuttering , unsure what to do about the faltering eurozone and unable to come to terms with Anglo-Saxon enterprise that the countries of Asia have made their own . #% It is the Commission that will take , and will be accountable for , the decisions on the programmes to be carried out by the agency . #% The European countries should forget the distractions of the European rapid reaction force separate from NATO and concentrate instead on improving military capabilities for alliance operations . #% You have to weigh up that consideration with the debatable issue about safety . #% The reason for its review is your directive . #% This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future . #% The Eurocontrol system is based on intergovernment control ; the Single European Sky framework directive is naked supranationalism . #% So we are formally in support of the resolution . #% With Chávez the choice is not difficult at all . #% The EPLP is in favour of an EU-wide organic label , but the Commission is already aware of Parliament 's support for this , and other parts of the report are of sufficient importance to vote against the whole report . #% Finally , who ever signed off the Commission 's accounts in 2001 ? #% Yet , because of climate change , there is no part of the planet where research is more vital . #% I give credit to all our colleagues , across all political groups , for the speed with which we have dealt with the electronic commerce directive this week . #% We need assurances that even the most marginalised children - including children with disabilities and orphans - have access to equitable health , welfare and judicial services . #% I was very encouraged by your words , but was very discouraged to notice that only 12 colleagues were here to hear it . #% The committee took a common approach in its opinion on the need to improve the quality of action and performance as a way of achieving better value for taxpayers ' money . #% The Belgian Government has not given me , as the Member responsible , any opportunity to hear or respond to any of the charges implied in its report . #% But , before we approve the new posts , we would very much like to see the reform elements in place and to know you are convinced that this whole reform process will be completed . #% I look at the climate change conferences , the enthusiasm with which Saudi Arabia supports the idea of carbon capture and storage being put in the CDM . #% It merely opens the opportunity for political division between European and North American allies at the very time when they should all be sitting around the same table . #% This has resonated among his audience , 50 000 of whom have this week signed the online petition asking for his release . #% Either the report I have read is wrong or you have gone directly against what the person who runs that UN Office is actually recommending , and we finance him . #% So , as Mr Deva makes clear , we have a long ` to do ' list - a list which will not be dealt with unless we confront the vested interests that benefit from the plight of the poor . #% There are some excellent ideas in the various reports and I hope that the Commission in the context of their work in 1997 will take on board many of their ideas . #% Sadly , violence seems to be rising throughout the region and reports of yet another massacre this week by the Indonesian army confirm once again its reputation for ruthless violence . #% We hope very much that this will take place . #% Mr President , once again we are faced with legislation designed for one purpose but dressed up as something else . #% In fact , you have very wisely produced a paper on good administration rather than a blueprint on governance or constitutional government as a whole , and that pragmatic and focused approach has much to commend it . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Sosa Wagner report as the EU should show strong leadership on all aspects of Internet governance in the international arena . #% We have seen the scientific evidence and clearly there is room there for worry . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for learning from its past experience . #% It is crazy to be doing that without having the ability to have a political dialogue . #% As the Commissioner for Employment she must take notice of what people are telling her . #% We must challenge conventional assumptions about animal test methods and scrutinise test methods with as much rigour as we scrutinise other aspects of this proposed new chemicals policy , because exposing animal tests to scrutiny will prompt the kind of debate we can not afford to ignore . #% Make no mistake , it is skilled dock workers who would suffer most -- people like Steven Drew from Yarmouth , sitting in the Public Gallery listening to this debate , who , together with his father Frank before him , have given 55 years ' combined service to the ports industry . #% I too am pleased to see that certain amendments that were put forward by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - but not accepted by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - have been tabled by a variety of the political groups in the House . #% But even if it were not , I would say that this would need thorough examination in committee rather than an amendment at the last minute in plenary . #% My final concern is that there has been no proper discussion on debt reconstruction in Iraq , nor even on who the debt belongs to . #% It works at the pace of a tortoise , and we want action now . #% We must ensure that , sooner rather than later , there is real dialogue between Member States and an exchange of best practice , so that we can put the strategies into effect and make this a reality . #% This proposal is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and , just like the port services directive , it should be disposed of into the waste bin . #% And so , another Christmas goose reduces its output of golden eggs ! #% Online gambling offers a new way for consumers to enjoy their gaming experience . #% 
I hope that the Commissioner will work with the WHO on these issues and look at them again to ensure that we find answers to the concerns of Members . #% We look forward and call upon all the parties to the agreement to implement it in good faith and to establish a transitional government as promised on 14 October 2003 , that will hopefully lead to free and fair elections . #% Secondly , we remain sceptical over the financial proberty of such schemes , and how such proceeds are spent . #% But in this arc of instability on our rim , while the EU is spending EUR 700 million plus in MEDA funds , only EUR 7 million of that is being spent on democracy . #% They build on the complexity of the historic cultural legacy of many millennia of interaction in the Mediterranean . #% But have we actually destroyed the world market or , is it Brazil , as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has just said ? #% The second half of this scam is to declare ` zero catch ' , so there are no EU contributions to the country in question , and deprivation becomes acute . #% Next , will you condemn forthrightly and totally the passage of the Bahati bill in Uganda , which allows the execution of homosexuals ? #% I am not sure from where , therefore , the UK Government intends to find and sustain its contribution to some new European rapid deployment force that it has proposed , unless this is just smoke and mirrors , or at the expense of commitments to NATO . #% Let us also harmonise the treatment asylum seekers receive ; let us establish Europe-wide common standards and then make sure that we enforce them . #% In the United Kingdom , we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector , offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective . #% Warfare between the nations of Europe is unthinkable . #% With this in mind , I support Mr Whitehead 's proposal to include the word `` safety '' in the title of the body to read European Food Safety Authority . #% The Commission has said that in the framework of the continuation of the asylum policy one of its aims would be to ensure that all Member States were operating to the highest possible standards and best practice . #% These are the neighbours with which Turkey is seeking a new relationship . #% The Socialists will support the vast majority of amendments before the House today . #% It is stuck in the Council . #% Mr Barroso , your determination to create a unitary state of Europe has not been diminished by anything as inconvenient as the referendum results in France and Holland . #% Let us in the EU throw away the post-war protectionist model and take a lead in embracing globalisation . #% Violence , especially against women or children , is completely unjustifiable and can not be accepted . #% Sometimes it was small garage paint-shops , sometimes it was domestic use of paint , sometimes it was other substances in other places . #% The original Commission proposal was dated April last year , but after that nothing happened . #% When we put better legislation on the agenda in future , it has to be respected . #% The death sentence on Dr Hashem Aghajari for apostasy on the basis of some obscure theological dispute is incomprehensible to the West . #% Mr President , I very much welcome this report . #% I see no one here listening to this debate . #% Mr Rocard goes as far as to state in his explanatory statement that he supports the Council 's position in principle . #% In turn , pension funds will not be able to secure proper retirement provision for their members and the currency will weaken . #% Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest , giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all . #% We can recognise that to prevent what has happened to Alan from happening to others requires a political understanding and solution . #% Mr President , firstly , I too should like to thank Mrs Frahm for her work and willingness to support a number of amendments , both from the committee and from myself . #% Should the Commission be treating football differently from any other multi-billion pound industrial operation ? #% Mr President , yesterday I managed to reach the Chamber just as the Minutes were being agreed - I had been attending another meeting . #% It is local authorities and large organization , quangos and national governments which are by and large responsible for a very high proportion of that . #% What could be fairer ? #% Mr President , allow me to reply to some of the points that have been raised . #% I would welcome his views on both of those ideas . #% It is perfectly fair that an asylum seeker from , say , Canada , will have a greater job convincing the authorities that asylum is justified , compared to someone coming for example from Iraq . #% We need to operate on a not-for-profit principle and apply that to all donations in all Member States across the whole of the European Union . #% There is universal access and universal demand . #% Clearly this is a ridiculous situation . #% This report maintains the EU 's emphasis on the need for the security and stability of the global Internet , the respect for human rights , freedom of expression , privacy , protection of personal data and the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what I find is a very well-balanced report , particularly in its seeking of consolidated resources and an austerity budget . #% At Johannesburg she , on behalf of the European Union , was successful in securing agreement on ambitious targets to improve sanitation for billions of people within a relatively short period of time . #% I know in the next few weeks she will be coming to a decision about the future of the PACTE programme . #% I mean , that takes some doing , does it not ? #% Therefore , labelling enables those whose judgement differs from mine to avoid products they chose to reject . #% I will be withdrawing my amendment , which put down a specific timescale of 6 months for getting the registry authorised , or rather to get the tender documents out in 15 months overall . #% We need clarification in some of the parties . #% Violence against women and children occurs in many different public and private situations and has many causes and effects . #% We have added recitals explicitly setting this out as an objective of the legislation and tightening those technical requirements to make sure that provision is effective . #% The EU 's role , in my opinion , is to support a peaceful settlement of the problem over the former princely state , with the EU willing to act as an honest broker for peace , but only if both sovereign governments ask for our help , as , ultimately , we regard the Kashmir dispute as a bilateral matter . #% The rejectionists are in the south . #% The report acknowledges that every state in the European Union and elsewhere in the world needs some sort of interception to protect national security , safeguard its economy and fight crime . #% Slipping through these huge powers in the slipstream of a liberalisation measure is quite inappropriate . #% The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament 's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendments has been retained . #% Furthermore , this report welcomes an EU minimum of EUR 2 m with future increases in line with inflation . #% The way to do that is to make sure it is accountable to the only democratically elected body we have among the European Union institutions . #% It is far better than what the Council wanted which was the 13-year period . #% It is important to remember that . #% I particularly congratulate you on your conclusions regarding the need for more transparency and speed - absolute support for that - and on the importance of the high technology sectors - yes , but not just those . #% In conclusion , we should explore as many ways as possible for levering extra investment into development , but the methods we choose must have public support and they must never be covert . #% The first refers to the improvement of the quality of budget execution . #% Would he not also agree that peace-keeping on the island will be a central responsibility for the European Union , through the process of settlement and following this process , for a considerable period before tranquillity and stability truly return to that poor strife-torn place . #% I would raise two points with the rapporteur . #% Should it not be asking why Spain can afford to send so many vets over to the United Kingdom to implement a related directive and perhaps be insisting that some of these officials be retained in their homeland to implement Community law in their own country ? #% 
And it can not be out of some misinformed support for constitutional principles in Chile , which Pinochet is seeking to exploit , because critics have long known how the military wrote the rules of transition precisely to protect Pinochet from being removed as chief and to allow him to serve now as a non-elected senator . #% Madam President , before we go on to Amendment No 5 , I should like to point out that we have not quite finished voting on paragraph 17 . #% There is also no call for any constructive movement on the part of the Republic of Cyprus , which is left to determine the pace of Turkey 's accession negotiations ( according to recital B ) and whose interests even intrude into NATO , where Turkey is then blamed for making difficulties ( paragraph 54 ) . #% I have made my position clear . #% And by 43 % to 26 % - for the first time in over 30 years - a massive majority of Britons said they want us to leave this European Union if Mr Barroso gets his way . #% Therefore , if we are to have a global quota , can we not have a guarantee that all traditional suppliers will be able to sell their traditional volumes ? #% Firstly , while people must be punished if they have committed a crime , it is essential that while they are awaiting trial in another Member State accused persons should not find themselves in a more difficult situation than if they were in their own country . #% For these reasons , the ECR Group has abstained on amendments 1-17 . #% However flawed it may be , we should welcome the progress we are making and continue the work in this area . #% This would be very convenient in preventing his testimony before UK courts . #% That is a tragedy because the summit was to have considered a number of proposals for reform in the Arab region . #% I am the most ardent campaigner for respect for human rights , but not where this is a cover for subversion or where extremists masquerade under a human rights placard . #% Does the Commissioner agree that this will lead to the revolution we have been pressing for , with a shift away from a concentration on initial education and training towards continuing training and lifelong learning ? #% Even in such a difficult case , if the country 's first priority was to fight a rising deficit , what would then happen is that it would be unable to take the steps to deal with the unemployment problem and the problem of the decline in its economy . #% There is a special case for a certain amount of extra help for those setting up business early on in their career , because they do not have the capital behind them and they need extra support . #% We are not doing that . #% Fighting for women 's rights is not a new phenomenon , and I want to pay tribute to all the women 's organisations round the world that are still fighting for equality between men and women . #% But if it turns out that all those initiatives fail and he still turns his back on the willingness of the international community to have dialogue with him , then it will be time to take stock of what is happening . #% It is simply part and parcel of the independence of a committee of inquiry such as this that there should be some critical remarks . #% The only possible solution is one based on UN Resolutions 242 , 338 , 1397 and 1402 , involving the acceptance of a two-state solution which will give security to the State of Israel and dignity to the Palestinians . #% However , I would run a mile - well perhaps I could manage half a mile - from the amendments by the PSE Group ! #% I saw the same differences between Fair Trade farmers and non-Fair Trade farmers in the Windward Islands , on the banana farms . #% I am happy to endorse what he has just said and thank him , our staff and the Commission staff for producing a proposal which will significantly enhance safety at sea . #% I hope Mr Moorhouse has something approaching the courage sufficient to stand up and withdraw that slur . #% We do not want to be involved in a North-versus-South debate or one between those who have a particular sector of the agricultural market in their care against those who have other such sectors . #% He has certainly confirmed that with his views this afternoon . #% I am very pleased that much of the opinion I drafted has been accepted by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , particularly the section on penalties and ensuring that we have the same penalties across the EU . #% For those reasons I shall be abstaining from voting on Mr Trichet 's appointment . #% First of all , there is a very strong case against agreeing to the EU/Mexico agreement on human rights grounds . #% I view the future role of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators as crucial in achieving the long-desired internal market in gas and electricity . #% In that respect , I would commend to you the amendments , particularly those that apply to the articles and the annex which control the emission limit values from the large combustion plants . #% Does it not occur to the Commission that terrorists probably are more aware of the Regulation than your average passenger and will therefore act accordingly ? #% There are of course other areas that need serious attention , not least the situation of children in care , the integration of the Roma and animal health and welfare controls . #% The question that I want to ask and that we are all going to ask is : who are you ? #% What strikes me is the sheer naivety of both the Commission and the Council in tackling such a highly political issue as if it were nothing more than a technical decision . #% Do you expect those countries to benefit from EDF money if the Council decides that you will support the African Union from the tenth EDF ? #% It ought to be pretty simple , because this is about our citizens being able to see what European law is ; when there is a problem , to be able to see what the enforcement process is ; and , finally , to see the result of that enforcement . #% The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform . #% But if there is a case to answer , this is the time to look at it much more carefully and I hope colleagues will support me . #% My colleague , Mrs Morgan , spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure . #% The implication of the directive on patients ' rights is to enhance those already allowed ; in particular , those patients who can not get adequate treatment within the UK may now travel elsewhere within the EU under provisions which already exist . #% When they join on 1 January they should have the same rights as everyone else . #% Madam President , I am pleased that I have been able to participate in the work of this temporary Committee of Inquiry ; indeed , of having played a small part in bringing it into being . #% If we offer people money and they can not then obtain it , they will only end up more frustrated than they were before . #% This Parliament will now develop its own positive critique of the outcome of the IGC and prepare to exploit it , but we must also explain and justify to a fairly sceptical electorate what has happened . #% I finish by saying that as human rights feature more prominently in a range of foreign and security policy domains , and as cross-cutting issues demand more consistent participation , our knowledge and proficiency must be drawn on as joint decision-maker when it comes to initiating consultations and suspending agreements on the basis of human rights . #% I should also like to ask the Commissioner if he will ensure that as far as the WTO is concerned , there is full consultation with civil society and NGOs and that labour issues are taken into account ? #% I would like to welcome all of that . #% This is what the Dublin Convention , which we sought to review earlier this week in the Marinho report , is all about . #% We certainly need to target the media and information formers . #% There is great potential and we are looking forward to hearing from the Commission later this year with proposals to encourage bio-fuels and other alternatives as a supplement - and perhaps a complement - to oil at present . #% As long as those market distorting subsidies to fossil fuels continue we can not realistically talk about a fair or level playing field in the European Union . #% This wall is between the professional politicians of the political establishment and the people . #% We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else . #% That is why the question has been tabled in the terms it has . #% It is a slur on the people who work in the Commission and the huge commitment that they have shown , in working 75 hours a week or more , month after month , to suggest that this Commission has done nothing in two years . #% The Lisbon Summit gave voice to the possibility of a single market which was matched by investment in training and release of capital through the use of the financial services action plan , complemented by the risk capital action plan . #% The truly tragic events of last week emphasise the importance of the fight against terrorism and organised crime . #% The UK also has a problem . #% At the same time , we are running enormous risks of nuclear materials falling into the hands of non-state actors . #% We need to be looking towards a new policy architecture to deal with all these questions . #% My questions to him are as follows : first , how will the communication actually change matters on the ground in countries so that in emergency situations better coordination takes place . #% You have done the Commission 's bidding , you have done everything you can to get Bulgaria into the European Union , and it will lead to a mass migration . #% In sum , it reads rather like a routine bureaucratic document without serious political leadership or guidance . #% He had his full time , I did cut him off and I did make a remark concerning the case that he had raised , in a personal capacity . #% So this might just sound like a football story , but it is a very serious issue . #% 
We believe that intergovernmental action still has the upper hand , and that is at the expense of the méthode communautaire in the transatlantic relationship . #% Since it is essential in all this that we have proper inspection and monitoring of what is going on , this is going to be tightened up and assurances have been made that any transporters who offend against European regulations on these matters will instantly lose their licences for transportation . #% Shelf registration should be optional and not compulsory . #% However , road transport , quite rightly , remains the main choice for the majority , due to its ease and flexibility . #% Secondly , the problem in Slovenia , as you well know , is their lack of administrative capacity . #% Madam President , I had understood that Mr Verheugen was going to give a full explanation of the interview that he gave to the Süddeutsche Zeitung . #% Law is , as it were , our main product . #% Compromise means giving and taking on both sides and at the end accepting something that is not exactly what you originally wanted . #% I thought that was a remarkable achievement , Commissioner , and I thank you for your efforts to do that . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that reply . #% I am not saying that women should be forced to stay at home . #% What disappoints me is that quite often we say this is intended , but in practice it does not occur . #% I call on the authorities to release those detainees immediately , unless they are charged with a recognisable criminal offence . #% Human trafficking , prostitution and genital mutilation are just some of the horrors facing girls and women in developing countries . #% I said that in the UK we do not have pigswill . #% It is pretty shameful , in my view , that my own country regards these conditions as too onerous . #% Secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless . #% On question 4 , in September 2000 the Council approved negotiating directives for a Community re-admission agreement with Morocco . #% It is progressive enough for us to feel that it will be significant in protecting workers and yet it is also realistic enough to produce results . #% Is the Commissioner aware of the huge tensions which exist between the external DGs and the SCR now because of the confusion about tasks , because of the staffing difficulties that DG VIII has , for instance , because of their staff being moved to the SCR ? #% Whilst we almost never vote for any legislation , we would like to point out that we did vote in favour of Amendment 75 , which rejected the Commission 's proposal for a common expulsion policy , but not for the reasons/justification given by the group which tabled the amendment . #% I am therefore quite prepared to argue the case for them . #% Those amendments have been available for over two weeks in translation . #% However , the British Labour members have some difficulties with the Commission 's proposals as they stand . #% Firstly , given what she said about the Democratic Republic of the Congo , will Europeans support the appointment of a special mandate holder for that country ? #% They have a wide-ranging agenda in Johannesburg , just as we have here . #% The proposed limits in Mr Lange 's amendments are extremely strict , particularly for two and four-stroke engines . #% On the Commission , firstly , I would like to see us having an ongoing monitoring of the budget to follow up the work of our colleague Mr Costa Neves in last year 's budget . #% The Council must get on with it . #% How can the Commission help women both as workers and as entrepreneurs in small firms ? #% SMEs themselves fundamentally disagree , and they should know . #% If we can not answer our citizens ' straightforward questions about how we implement EU law , then it is a poor show . #% There are also implications for the budget of the European Union which are unacceptable and will be separately resisted in the budgetary process . #% The sentence has been delayed until 2004 to allow her to wean her child . #% . Madam President , I would like to place on record my appreciation to the general rapporteur , Mr Mulder , for his attention to our concerns . #% The message which should be sent to the summit is therefore that politics , economics and security policy in the post-Cold War world are all beginning to be closely intertwined . #% I thank the presidency and its services for checking this so quickly . #% I congratulate the Commission on this achievement , in particular Sir Leon Brittan , because this means that we can once again engage in discussions about these very sensitive subjects . #% Is it within the next month ? #% I do not have to outline what that is , but I have to outline one small problem which we have not yet resolved , that is , how the remaining money - the EUR 27 million for the reconversion of the Spanish fisheries fleet - will be found for the budget after next year . #% This year alone , there have already been more attacks than there were in the whole of the year 2000 . #% Mr President , the Committee on Industry in general welcomes the Commission 's communication because the EPAs between the EU and different regions could reinforce economic cooperation between ACP countries and encourage their economic development . #% Mr President , I was pleased and honoured to attend all the hearings of the Central Bank governors and the remaining five members of the Executive Board held in Brussels last week . #% Mr President , I wish to begin , like everyone else , by thanking the rapporteur for his report . #% We should be starting with the UN/ECE figures , with the Gothenburg protocol and revising them as is proposed by Mrs Myller in her report . #% I believe that the Galileo satellite system serves two vital purposes . #% This is not the way for the House to run its business . #% Let us not in any way underestimate the difficulties . #% If that classes me as a heretic , I hope I do not suffer the fate of Abdel Kareem , sentenced to four years in jail in Egypt for criticising both his government and the violent radicals in his country . #% This is an untruth . #% This Parliament tamely signed it , without bothering to verify the terms or attempting to negotiate more favourable conditions . #% Mr President , item 6 of the Minutes where we modify the agenda for the week is accurate but probably rightly does not mention that voting time on Thursday has been brought forward to 11.30 a.m. because of the large number of amendments tabled to certain reports . #% The EU action plan is highly ambitious , as has already been said , setting out not only to support Russian democratic and economic reforms through TACIS , but also addressing contractual relations , regional cooperation , nuclear energy and nuclear safety , the environment , economic reconstruction , humanitarian aid and the future European security structure . #% It was very helpful and encourages Parliament to proceed on the lines which we have laid down . #% I am encouraged that the interim leadership has promised substantial reforms because embarking on such a path will greatly strengthen Tunisia 's relationship with the European Union . #% The Indian authorities and people have shown commendable restraint in the face of these latest outrages . #% For instance , the procuring countries may be looking for some form of local investment , involving local firms in assembling the equipment . #% It was bent on not cluttering up that directive with the minutiae of detail extant in the STCW Convention . #% Also , GATT requires the dismantling of the system of import levies and export subsidies . #% I agree with those other Members who think it is absolutely awful , but that is a matter of individual taste . #% Clearly we have to work towards a global solution that will be driven by technology . #% I am sorry to delay things , Madam President , but there is another possibility . #% Mr President , I welcome what I believe we will all agree is an exemplary piece of work . #% We have seen that it is very much at the frontline when it comes to providing a future for a solid European Union . #% Both the South African Parliament and the European Parliament are anxious now to sign off this agreement once and for all before both in South Africa and here we move on to elections . #% That is where much improvement can take place . #% 
I , as a British Conservative , have doubts about that . #% I am sad to say that we have an example here of French protectionism which has to be stopped . #% The title is significant : ` Health care and care for the elderly : Supporting national strategies for ensuring a high level of social protection ' . #% Hence we support the amendments about tightening up timetables and response times on work permits , about the requirement to inform the applicant of problems in an application and about moving away from the employer having to demonstrate the need , yet again , for a third-country national to fill a job if one becomes vacant within 12 months - although , from some of the horror stories we have heard about the length of time it can take to get permits , perhaps we should extend that even further . #% Both processes satisfy the criteria of best practicable environmental option and are accepted by environmental inspectors in the United Kingdom . #% It is of vital importance that Parliament backs this compromise when it votes at 12 noon today , because without it we will not be in a position to deliver an integrated financial market - whether in 2004 , 2005 or indeed ever . #% Among all this we have the on-going discussions between Parliament and the Council on the interinstitutional agreement . #% All problems can be resolved in politics if the will is there . #% I strongly support those amendments which refer to the seriousness of environmental pollution as a risk to health and a major source of concern for European citizens . #% Madam President , I welcome and support both the reports we are discussing today . #% That is something that we need to reflect on between now and the second reading . #% How much better it would be if that committee , and indeed all other committees , had left such legislation alone in its simpler and purer form in the first place . #% They produce unsubsidised wines that people want to buy , at a price they can afford . #% The President-in-Office and the Commissioner use the formulation of FYROM - the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia . #% Lord Bethell is , and remains , firmly a member of the British Conservative Group . #% In addition , we draw attention to the fact that although white phosphorus is a conventional and not a chemical weapon , Britain - but not America - has signed Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons banning the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations . #% Those basic safeguards must be restored . #% If it does not , the UK Conservative delegation would agree with Mr Hökmark , as well as many other colleagues , and reluctantly vote to reject this report as it stands . #% All these measures will contribute to our common goal of tackling this unacceptable , appalling , disgraceful figure of 45 000 deaths every year . #% This is the major achievement , and I particularly want to thank the Belgian Presidency - and I see that they are represented here this evening - because they resisted demands from some Member States to try and get themselves a carve-out from this 60-day requirement . #% Mr Coelho quite rightly drew attention to the fact that when we are 25 countries in the EU - and later on 27 or 28 - it will be even more challenging . #% We are concerned , too , that the crisis will spread to the other countries in the region . #% That 's not the vision that British Conservatives have for the EU , and we will be promoting a very different vision of the EU when we form a new political grouping in the next parliament . #% I look forward very much to your response . #% I understand that the British Government is seriously censoring such documents as may be made available . #% Therefore the events of the next week or so are going to be crucial . #% Mr President , over the past year we have seen many very encouraging developments in terms of Bulgaria 's progress towards accession . #% If we could have an indication of the answers to those questions , and Members involved in this area know some of the answers , that would go a long way towards making the case for a European regulator . #% And if we rely on European consultants , European companies , European technical assistance , are we not just reinforcing the dependence which development is trying to replace ? #% We should rightly express our concern at what has happened and that the situation was allowed to deteriorate so far . #% We would like to see the Commission come forward with proposals to ensure that there is harmonised training across Member States in order to ensure that workers ' representatives are able to put their case as effectively as possible . #% Structural adjustment programmes , liberalisation and fiscal reforms have also frequently involved cuts in health , education and social and poverty alleviation expenditures , and these should have been avoided in the past and must be resisted in the future if poverty is not to be rapidly increased and demand further reduced . #% Mr President , we are being asked to comment on a 283-page report that was not released until late on Friday morning , and that was produced in two languages . #% We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there . #% It is a vote to ban animal-tested products where alternative tests exist , to phase out animal tests over a 4-year period and to phase in a marketing ban in an agreed period thereafter . #% At the moment this is a missing element and yet it is supposed to be a key element of the spring summits as decided at Göteborg ? #% This situation could best be resolved if the Burmese regime were to respect the results of the 1990 elections , as the international community has consistently demanded . #% As the honourable Member would expect , the Commission has been following the recent developments on the bilingual regime in Istria with close interest , although the issue has rightly been treated as a bilateral matter by the Italian Government . #% Mr President , can you assure me that the President-in-Office will be here if we want to ask him questions because I specifically wanted to ask for an answer to a very specific question that I asked . #% It is the same sort of group of people , who are not football fans , who are responsible for this . #% We should not forget the centres of research excellence , particularly in the United States , and we should seek as wide a collaboration as we can . #% It is for those reasons that , if we want to ensure that consumer and social and labour issues are part of the agenda , we must ensure that these networks do not actually take over our agenda . #% That is already provided for in our Rules of Procedure . #% I have the pleasure of shadowing Mr MacCormick in the Legal Affairs Committee . #% That is why I am very strongly supportive of the policies the European Union pursues . #% I hope the Irish tell you all where to go in the second referendum on 2 October - and they just might ! #% This specific case demonstrates precisely the absence of democratic accountability in EU trade policy . #% That is not a success . #% . -- Mr President , Commissioner , you have already outlined the contents of the partnership agreement and explained to us that it is one of the first -- if not the first -- to be negotiated by the Commission as part of the new philosophy agreed by the Council in July 2004 . #% You ratified the Treaty through your own parliamentary chambers , without of course the thought of giving the people in your own country a referendum to express their opinion . #% It is time to give these warm but rather woolly sentiments some real meaning and action . #% I support the idea that Romania should be able to join the EU , but I do not believe at this point in time either that they are really ready for membership or that the Union is really ready to receive them . #% But the original intention of this report was to concentrate on the role of women 's networks and their potential to contribute to the socio-economic fabric of fisheries-dependent communities . #% We all hope that it will work with us in the European Parliament to make our seas safer and protect our coastal environment . #% We are seeing the average age of the farming Community increase with falling numbers of young farmers . #% We stood firm in this House with regard to the reaction provoked by depictions of the Prophet Mohammed in Danish newspapers . #% I hope that the Commission will urge the Ecofin Council to look at this question again . #% I ask Mr Albertini , when he winds up , and I ask the ALDE Group , which has also supported this , why they are trying to turn it round and why they are trying to favour road transport . #% I hope you could pass on those remarks to the rest of your colleagues . #% The fault lies in part with Parliament , because we do not scrutinise and follow up the budget as we should . #% The European Union should await the election results and respond towards Belarus accordingly , in line with a step-by-step policy . #% I believe that the burden of proof really does exist , that this measure is required and every month , every week and every day that we delay allows people to be unnecessarily injured on our roads . #% There is no doubt that Bulgaria and Romania have been subject to a degree of scrutiny probably unparalleled in EU history . #% I congratulate the rapporteur once more . #% It must be plain , simple , clear and precise . #% But I want to emphasise some issues and I hope Mrs Schreyer will take them up and endeavour to ensure that they are pushed through the Commission . #% 
That will form the basis for the compromise that I want to commend to all my colleagues this afternoon . #% In the UK we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions . #% The Commission would show it is doing its job . #% Once this EU-inspired exodus began , people from neighbouring countries followed suit , making it worse . #% Yet Egypt - as we have heard from Mr Posselt - is a friend and ally . #% Obviously our group agrees with this . #% The evidence we have shows that a lot of things have been going on that should not have happened , and they ought to be stopped . #% As he has said , it is the result of collaborative work and we in the Socialist Group are largely very happy with the content . #% It is the case in my country that we have seen minced beef and lamb and other meats mixed up together . #% However , we condemn the reference to one particular religious tradition within the resolution , because we believe this is inconsistent with the multi-ethnic , multi-faith society which is the reality for all of our countries . #% But that is a matter which I am sure we will discuss endlessly in the coming months . #% Improving the legal status of refugees , as stated in Amendment No 2 , is not , to my knowledge , part of any common immigration and asylum policy . #% You lose one referendum so you call another to get the result you want . #% I hope that in the future , the Bureau will come forward with recommendations and proposals , not only about spending , but also about ways in which we can make efficiency savings in the future . #% I shall put some simple questions to which we all know the answers and on which we are all agreed . #% Our common future depends on finding an effective way to ensure integration and sustainability . #% Mr President , I thank the rapporteur for his kind mention of my Amendment No 11 , which referred to Article 6 , paragraph 5a ( new ) . #% The proposed European Union Constitution prohibits ` any discrimination based on any grounds such as sex , race , colour , political or any other opinion ' . #% Europol , which you mentioned , is only an information collection and exchange centre . #% Finally , can I say that the British Labour Members in this Parliament will be able to support all these reports with the solitary exception of the second report from Mr Orlando , where we will have to abstain . #% The reports would go to OLAF , be properly investigated and would protect the position of MEPs . #% Madam President , no sooner had agreement been reached with the Council , than Greenpeace , the WWF and the RSPB were denouncing it as inadequate and calling on Members to throw it out . #% Madam President , on a point of order under Rule 136 , concerning committees of inquiry : yesterday evening I and two other colleagues attempted to have access to the meeting of the BSE inquiry . #% Contrast that with this present method : one far-reaching proposal for a directive literally dumped on the table at the end of the last mandate . #% Thirdly , it has been clarified that the agreed international accounting standards will be published in their legally binding form in the Official Journal in all the official languages . #% After all , Commission President Barroso said in this House in July last year : ` red tape is strangling SMEs ' . #% When ever ? #% While I welcome China 's recent announcement that it would sign the UN 's International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , it should also be pressed to sign the UN Convention on Political and Civil Rights . #% They are against ethnic diversity and they do not accept the benefits given to our society by all its people . #% This can largely be avoided . #% People look back to thalidomide and think that the dangers of a given product emerge very quickly , in birth defects or something of that kind . #% Perhaps you could let me know later . #% The 342 remaining posts will be given back to the budgetary authority . #% It will cover the Euromed countries of the Barcelona Process and the Western NIS countries , as well as the three Caucasus republics , which currently constitute the European Neighbourhood Policy countries on which I am Parliament 's rapporteur . #% As Mrs Malliori has just said , if - despite all the tragic possibilities - we can see this as an opportunity to bring closer together in some form of European health centre the process of monitoring and analysing this threat , which is certainly more serious and less known than anything we have seen in recent years , then that at least will mean that some good comes out of this problem . #% I want the north-west to regain its position at the forefront of technological progress . #% Now that the records have been put into the public domain , will you advise all concerned not to allow Parliament to continue looking secretive and foolish , but to take speedy action to bring us into the twenty-first century and get the information published on our own website and made permanently available to European citizens ? #% National security does not end at national borders . #% The Prime Minister of Luxembourg , Mr Jean-Claude Juncker , recently said to reporters in Brussels : ` I am beginning to seriously consider the option of not changing the Pact at all ' . #% All these countries have been affected by this decision . #% We can not let them get away with this . #% The benefits it offers are vague and speculative - they are unproven and unquantified , but the costs are real , immediate and massive . #% We gain nothing by delay . #% This is an interesting issue . #% Mr President , when the rapporteur started work on this report , there was a real danger that this Parliament would end up rejecting the Treaty of Nice through an unholy alliance of those who felt it went too far and those who felt it did not go far enough , so it is a tribute to their work that they have steered Parliament to a very sensible analysis of the Treaty and a strategy for moving forward from here . #% We also welcome the additional moves from the Commission on the social dimension of globalisation , to which we think insufficient attention has been paid . #% That is why we have always had a very balanced approach and recognised the efforts that the candidate countries have made . #% Finally , our group agrees that strong international rules are needed to manage trade . #% I am afraid this report quite deliberately sends the opposite signal . #% We do not want them to feel that they are going to be held back in any way . #% I welcome this report because it will show us a way forward . #% I also want to thank all my colleagues in the political groups in the Committee on Legal Affairs , who have stuck together with me on this long journey and supported a common view , which , subject to sufficient presence in this Chamber today , will be clearly shown in our vote . #% We could have added the tragic murders of young men in the United Kingdom recently , and it is clear that no EU Member State is free from this hatred . #% My rights and freedoms , Mr President , are not in your gift and they are not at your discretion , they are my birthright . #% I appeal to the Commission to accept the amendments proposed by some of my colleagues on the question of occupational health and the impact upon the health of workers in these circumstances . #% Then our response must be united , relentless and firm , but always proportionate and based upon the rule of law . #% That , with the input of the Council , has made this a good proposal , and a very good one for Mrs Paulsen to end on , because I know this may be her last report in Parliament . #% Fourth , there is a need to reform the existing package travel directive which is now not only outdated , but ineffectual and allows some airlines to offer packages without being covered by the directive . #% This Parliament has a strong reputation for promoting the protection and improvement of public health and , as I will indicate later , we ourselves can still improve . #% When this Parliament convened its hearings on Shell 's inhuman exploitation of the Ogoni peoples in Nigeria last year , little did we think that we would so soon revisit shockingly equivalent allegations against other European oil companies - British Petroleum and Total of France in the Casanare region of Colombia from where our delegation has just returned : weekly oil spills , water contamination , chemical overflows , illegal sites and the invasion of protected forest - all admitted by local BP officials ; and where eyewitnesses describe fish floating dead in polluted rivers and livestock blinded from grazing on polluted fields and where the government 's Environment Minister admits that he prefers the oil revenues to fight a war to the environmental improvements to build a peace . #% Would he now agree that it is the spur of competition and the existence of alternatives which is most likely to keep a public/private partnership on schedule and in budget ? #% Secondly , the Spanish Government has transmitted a new request to the Italian authorities without waiting for the opinion of the Council of State of Spain , which is ostensibly the reason why it has not yet replied to the European Parliament . #% I have to say to you that , yes , this is a matter that receives our considerable and considered opinion at all times . #% The question we have asked in our committee , and the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets have also looked at this , is whether this is the right package . #% What is quite clear is the immense pace and change of technology and the reconstruction of markets that is going on all the time . #% Equally , Rule 125 ( 1 ) ( d ) is relevant because it talks about amending more than one of the individual articles or paragraphs of a text . #% 
Does not the survey by my constituent , Mr Vaughan - showing that British banks are charging up to three times more than their Dutch counterparts - reveal that we have a particular problem in Britain ? #% This requires real economic reform that delivers more growth , flexible labour markets and higher employment throughout the EU . #% Therefore , it is vitally important that the new Amendment No 65 for equine species is adopted . #% However , I must say that I could not support a greater role including operational actions by Europol until we have in place proper structures for democratic political accountability of its activities - they clearly do not exist at the moment . #% We can speculate whether his abduction was for reasons of politics , money or recognition , but we do not know which , if any . #% I am confident that many more will flow from the groundwork that this report gives us . #% If adjusted by the amendments by my group , it will be a well-balanced set of proposals , well-balanced notably on the delicate question of the equilibrium between large and smaller Member States . #% Compared with mainstream crops such as oil seeds and cereals , they require low levels of chemical and fertiliser treatment . #% Putting it bluntly , we believe that the Council of Ministers , the Commission and the European Parliament are complicit in a deception of the public . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for his measured statement this afternoon . #% Is there not a single Commissioner prepared to accept responsibility for this and do the decent thing ? #% What did you hear ? #% We are looking today in the world from which I emerged , at a situation where diversity of output is growing and where the power of those who control that output and buy the rights in it is also growing . #% Mr President , my group , the Liberal Group , wants to make three points , largely in the form of questions . #% And that is a lesson that we have to take to heart . #% Impact assessment can not displace political decision making . #% Mr President , I supported the resolution on Kaliningrad by Mrs Hoff . #% I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights . #% Firstly , is he considering specific limits for the percentage of water which can be added ? #% There has to be a limit to what we can do in order to prevent them . #% These are not just my views and those of my delegation . #% I can see that it is a subject that brings great excitement to the rest of the parliamentarians and indeed the massive audience that we have here tonight . #% I appreciate that it is not an easy business , but we will be abstaining tomorrow . #% I am aware that no one in Mr Prodi 's Commission accepts political responsibility for anything , but am sure there are members of the Commission who have political antennae and can sense the mood of Parliament when it comes to the problems found at Eurostat and in the accounting system . #% Proper impact assessments should also be undertaken before embarking on new laws and I hope the Presidency will make progress on less legislation and less regulation being an essential part of the reform agenda that I would like to see Europe develop . #% Although the Garriga Polledo report perhaps underplays the degree of danger unleashed by liberalizing the financial markets , I believe we can support the remedies suggested by the rapporteur . #% Mr President , I report to the House at the end of a long and not wholly satisfactory saga . #% The issue about who owns your time , who controls it , who says where you have to be at what point , is a key question when deciding whether or not you are actually at work . #% Stability and growth pacts are important but public investment should not be included in those figures . #% We need to realise that full employment helps create social inclusion and not the other way around . #% After very long negotiations , we have an agreement that my group can sign up to . #% My previous remarks demonstrate that to me it is first and foremost a measure for environmental protection . #% It remains to be seen if the `` one-size-fits-all '' model of interest rates will work in countries like Ireland , without causing large tax rises and damaging the popularity of the Euro-project . #% The political , economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation . #% I am delighted to hear your upbeat and very positive reply . #% Air transport is already the world 's fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and could account for up to 15 % by the year 2050 . #% Therefore , in conclusion , please let us avoid , when we come to decisions on this , a Soviet-style approach to planning which is going to take us too far into the future of our commitments . #% These insist that mutual recognition should be extended to bans on driving also . #% It is that , although the European budget pays most of the cost , it does not have most of the say . #% Mr President , concerning this split vote on paragraph 13 , I know Parliament was very pleased that this report was deferred from the last session so the rapporteur could be here and not in the British House of Commons . #% I would like to pick up on a number of points built on what the Commissioner said . #% I call on the European Union to do everything in its power to make sure that we see a peaceful resolution to what I have described as both a tragic and a pointless conflict . #% It is not a feminist issue either . #% While I understand that many countries do not fulfil their current quota allocations , including the UK , I strongly believe , that in line with the abolition of milk quotas in 2015 , we need to get farmers used to the idea of having the option to produce more . #% That kind of investment needs to be discouraged and from this Parliament we urge European Union citizens also to put pressure on Total , a French company , to take similar measures . #% We do not need regulating , Mr Borg , by the likes of you . #% Almost every time I open a newspaper , I see the names Patten and Solana in connection with some new trouble spot in the world . #% Its information assists mariners , aircraft and emergency planners from a range of real-time sources around the world , but we need more than these sorts of facilities . #% Secondly , as I have already said regarding comprehensive impact assessments , we must have an impact assessment for each Member State , taking into account the impact on industry , on business and on the workforce . #% That is our message to substandard ships and the flags of convenience . #% This resolution calls for us to renew our efforts . #% Could the Commissioner not join with me in pleading with the British Government to open the books in this case and allow the public to judge for themselves whether or not the channel tunnel is safe ? #% It is only a matter of time before this issue resurfaces to disturb the consciences again of the western world . #% I have to admit to you that the blame lay with the UK Government and a Prime Minister who was hell bent on calling a general election and wanted to get the disease under control . #% Curiously , this amount is spread very unevenly over the ten years in question with most of it , more than EUR 50 million , concentrated in 2014 and 2015 . #% Overall , this is a useful step forward . #% I quote from this morning 's : ` Peers tell Brussels to give back cash from EU budget ' . #% It is another positive step in the improvement of both safety at sea and the protection of our very important marine environment . #% Does this Charter simply aim to be an expensive distributor of compensation in the dreadful fullness of time ? #% Do we want to make it happen ? #% I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council , because we have worked very hard together on an extremely complex and technical proposal . #% As we all know , electronic commerce is going to become ever more important to the economic and social wellbeing of the citizens of the European Union . #% I should like to associate myself with the points made by Mrs Gill on comitology where that is particularly damaging to the delivery of this budget line . #% These are all important policy objectives that we too would have put high on the agenda . #% Recently it proposed that 80 % of resources be managed in a decentralised way . #% We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government . #% 
But how practical is it ? #% There is also going to be a need to provide consumers with special protection in certain sectors . #% Fears of blood and food safety arise almost daily . #% To that end , there were many initiatives in the field of civil justice , ensuring that where we give the possibility to move , to do business , to work , to innovate , to trade and to buy , we deliver the balancing legal framework that would give security and access to justice . #% Last week we heard from the WHO that world capacity for producing vaccines is only 300 million doses a year . #% My final point is that this is all part of the Lisbon agenda , making Europe e-friendly and e-workable , and it is going to mean that if this principle is carried through into other areas of work , disabled European Union citizens will be able to participate on much more equal terms in this respect than we have seen to date . #% He is now in hospital with heart condition . #% Palestine can not be an independent state if it is not financially viable . #% Last year the British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , boasted of how he had battered the criminal justice system . #% This is where this House must step in for the good of all our citizens . #% We want to carry out our work on behalf of our constituents where it is most effective and cost efficient , namely in Brussels . #% In nearly all cases , habitats have to be managed and somehow protected . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and also the draftspeople on this rather complicated directive . #% We are not the only country that uses it either : Germany , France , the Netherlands , Spain and Luxembourg are all either using it or going to use it in the health or catering industries . #% I am afraid that the intervention did in fact influence things as regards that particular amendment . #% Looking to the future , I would like to pick up Mr Barón Crespo 's point . #% That will come soon , as will major debates on reforms of our agricultural structures . #% We must insist the Turkish authorities respond to the PKK cease-fire and make moves to political settlement , recognising Kurdish cultural and democratic rights . #% Mr President , this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to Directive 64/432 applicable to the Spanish Government . #% Luckily , having met with US Government officials , particularly Mr David Cohen , the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing in the US Treasury Department , recently in Washington , I was reassured by the multi-layered control systems and safeguards and independent oversight which I hope will lead to the implementation of this new agreement being beyond reproach . #% I therefore welcome this report and I support it extending as it does our framework trade and cooperation agreement to the new Member States of the Union . #% Then we had the compromise on phosphates . #% This year , I am delighted to say that the Commission has produced a very thorough and generally much better report and I would like to thank them for the cooperation they have shown . #% The rapporteur says that regions are the best qualified level to determine needs . #% More space in aircraft , for example , and less emphasis in getting as many people on board , in as small a place as possible with as much profit as possible . #% These targets were exceeded with three new appointments being made to the A1 grade and seven new appointments to the A2 grade . #% We are the dominant species . #% As we will all recall , UK Labour MEPs in the pockets of their trade unions voted to scrap the UK 's opt-out , despite instructions to the contrary from their own government . #% This is a very worrying delay in a very difficult process . #% Under this directive he would also face an entry ban . #% However , the Commission and Parliament will have to begin to act on their own rules in looking at the financial implications of legislative proposals in order for them to be taken into account . #% A question I think one could ask is about the motives of those who have tried to filibuster this report from beginning to end , of those who have tried to block it , of those who have tried every trick in the book and everything in the rule book to try and have it postponed . #% Life would be simpler for us all if there was only one responsibility . #% In the great debate that occupies us tonight between minimum and maximum harmonisation , those who are arguing , as the Environment Committee did , for minimum harmonisation , are doing so not because they wish to stall the proceedings of the Internet but because they do not want to see in individual Member States consumer protection significantly diminished , as it might be , by the levels of information provided in the directive as it stands . #% I was very glad to hear what you said about tariff escalation . #% They reject the conventional wisdom of ever-closer union and want to see a looser , more flexible system of intergovernmental cooperation . #% In this area , too , the application of general criteria should not be to the exclusion of the special provisions covering information provided to the consumer . #% This will be a very valuable workshop that will bring together the experts in the area and will focus particularly on the infectivity distribution , and that will include tissue distribution , between the new variant and classical CJD . #% We are an agricultural superpower and we can lead in the whole post-Doha agenda by opening markets and by ending the dumping of what we produce on to the world market , thereby producing distortions which developing countries simply can not deal with . #% on behalf of the ITS Group . - Madam President , this report is a contradiction in terms . #% It is a morally bankrupt , institutionally wrong and dangerously undemocratic organisation , a dinosaur in the modern world . #% I hope we are not going to have our votes delayed every month by a diatribe about the position of the radicals and other non-attached Members . #% We are now currently working on the European Investigation Order , a partner to the European Arrest Warrant . #% Mr President , while endorsing what my colleague Mrs Ahern has said about the Indian nuclear tests , I wish to draw to the attention of the House that this week in the UK it is Christian Aid week . #% My report on the Commission proposal has added , I believe , some important new aspects that were not necessarily considered by the Commission . #% I believe this would be an important step forward in developing greater commercial ties between the European Union and Hong Kong . #% Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency . #% Another area where the work of colleagues has been very helpful has been on the subject of frontier workers who face particular difficulties in juggling two systems . #% Do they believe that people on this side of the House do not believe in human rights ? #% Clearly we have not yet hit the regime where it hurts . #% I must admit I still fail to see how disclosure can really undermine the cases here , but my supplementary is about which Member States actually continue to give out the information on such letters of formal notice and which do not . #% The moratorium has been ignored and set aside , meaning that many children , even babies , identified as suitable for adoption by the government , signed off by the prime minister , have in reality been taken from suitable family settings by the authorities , against their will and disregarding the wishes of their foster families whose interest in adopting those same children was denied . #% If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process . #% It shows that business has already got the message , which will now be cascading through more and more levels of business . #% Finally , I would just mention the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments . #% The second key objective of my group was to stiffen the resolve of the Commission , to be more liberal and more ` market opening ' in its approach to the abolition of quantitative rules . #% I also welcome the move to provide EU funding for training and information about the health risks associated with asbestos . #% You now have an opportunity , through this directive , to end your self-declared war on the British Post Office and the British people . #% My one criticism of this agreement , seen from the point of view of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , is that it is so detailed and is broken down into so many points that it takes much of the flexibility away from the annual budgetary procedure . #% It is not a triumph , but it is not a defeat ; and the manager lives to fight another day . #% I am aware that non-medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation . #% Thirdly , on the study , would Mr Monti confirm that , if ECOFIN vote for a study in May , as is possible and I think likely , he will enthusiastically implement that decision . #% Let us , in this motion , also put our hands behind that effort . #% However , the fact that European Commission negotiating officials were reported a mere week before the US deal as discounting the likelihood of Chinese accession any time soon may suggest that the European Union has not been negotiating as convincingly as might be hoped . #% I should like to raise some of the salient points about which there will still be argument and upon which a number of the amendments have been based . #% We can not continue to spend a pittance fighting cancer and a fortune supporting tobacco . #% 
It is not just in Nigeria , but today we are focusing on Nigeria . #% Quite rightly , this year the Commission has highlighted that there has been absolutely no improvement at all in the overall employment position here in the Community . #% I wish , through you Mr President , to assure him that it was not made in a personal capacity but in my capacity as a Member of this House where I have certain democratic duties . #% The proposal in Amendment No 23 by Mr Falconer and others that investment fund managers who manage portfolio fund investments should be excluded from the takeover proceedings is simply out of touch with reality since most of those institutions represent pension funds which represent the savings of workers all over Europe . #% It will establish , for the first time , a pan-European investor base for growing and integrated euro-area financial markets . #% The Community wants to bring a portion of the system under supranational control . #% Overgrazing and deforestation are factors , but so is the rise in the world 's temperature . #% Last year , only two death sentences were carried out and the government has announced that it will promote a new law that will create the possibility for judges to substitute life without parole for the death penalty for capital crimes . #% Within a fortnight , of course , it had fallen ! #% However , if there is any truth in this rumour , can you discuss it in the Bureau and ensure that it is quashed . #% The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is doing neither . #% It may not be within your , power , President-in-Office , to fully answer Mr Paisley 's question , but I support what you said about the importance of the Irish language . #% I advance the proposal that the delegation should manage its own small-scale , capacity-building funds - a model which is effective for some Member State interventions , including those in the United Kingdom . #% This is not , in itself , an unwelcome development but it does exacerbate the risk of an over-concentration of ownership of the essential utilities . #% Whilst accepting the good work carried out by the Daphne Programme , the British Conservatives , for the reasons outlined above , have voted against further budgetary appropriations and abstained on the final vote . #% We all seem to be quite smug about this and seem to be wanting to sit back and say what a good job we have done , but we must not be too complacent . #% The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection , and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need . #% Therefore , we are supporting the appeal by our rapporteur for more information concerning the interinstitutional agreement between the Council , Parliament and the Commission on the expenditure of money on foreign and security policy . #% Why are the Commission and the Council blocking the opening up of trade with the North ? #% Judges are currently asked to enforce the judgments and orders of courts in other Member States without examining the facts , and they will be subject to increasing criticism and public unease if there is no EU-wide compliance with minimal procedural safeguards and defence rights for criminal investigations and prosecutions . #% We shall continue to monitor the implementation . #% The difficulty that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has had with this report , to which the rapporteur and Mr Donnelly have alluded , is that we have no context in which to set this work . #% It may , therefore , come as something of a surprise to people that today I have to declare that a delay in the final stages of the enlargement process can not be completely excluded . #% Hardly a country has escaped a natural disaster in the last few years and this is not counting the man-made catastrophes such as Chernobyl and , more recently , the toxic dam in Hungary . #% I think the time has come to make a political decision here that we have to have a binding energy saving target because without it , we are actually undermining everything else that we do on the economy , on energy security and on climate change . #% We have today , set up the framework for a surveillance state . #% It is not taking it seriously now . #% But I do need to stress to the Council that this is not the Grand Old Duke of York marching his troops up the hill , just to march them down again . #% Alas , we have been proven to be correct . #% The oil embargo and the flight ban will therefore be lifted . #% Commission Vitorino and his working group in the Convention are considering the technical and semantic niceties that will be involved in incorporation and I look forward to hearing from him how successful the efforts of his working group are proving . #% They are not a replacement or a supplement needed for the date-based export scheme . #% You replied that , as yet , you were not sure . #% That may sound like a lot , but when you look at the size and complexity of this package you will see that we have actually concentrated on improving and clarifying the basic provisions of the regulations . #% I do believe that further work on portability is essential to strengthen the single market . #% One of the things we have to be constantly on the lookout for is giving people a fair deal and making it possible for them to play a full part in the community , as full a part as any of us . #% We support an EPP working in parallel with national authorities , but not replacing them . #% If Mr Markov 's amendment had been more judiciously phrased it would have gained my support . #% However , the first part of the report brings three directives into a single regulation which would simplify . #% There is also a need to connect the existing oil and gas pipelines between the EU Member States . #% The European citizens undoubtedly need somebody to whom they can turn if they have problems with the administration and in Mr Söderman I know that we have an Ombudsman upon whom we can depend . #% President Chirac has been quoted as saying that for Muslim girls to wear headscarves is a sort of aggression . #% Mr Bowis talked about the committee 's bedding-down . #% In 2003 there was a range within Member States of between 24 % and 100 % of the infringements that were actually followed by a sanction . #% However , we should no more subsidise the very existence of farms than we should subsidise factories , quarries or coal mines . #% I join all parties in this House in urging that Israel -- the IDF in particular -- Hamas and all the people involved in these ghastly events respect international law and avoid further bloodshed . #% I urge this Parliament to ensure that this item is taken as early as possible on Tuesday afternoon . #% Let us be clear : what we are saying in this report is that we have heard testimony and seen corroborating facts , such as flight logs , which attest to extraordinary renditions having taken place in Europe , and it is highly implausible that governments or their agencies had no idea what was going on . #% The issues which our colleague Mr Howitt quite rightly says we should be putting in here : changing the infrastructure to make buses more accessible for disabled users . #% As Mr Blak 's resolution states in paragraph 8 , point 19 - and I thank him for this - when 880 million people world-wide lack any access to health services , just 1 % of the Commission 's external assistance budget went to health in 1999 and we do not have any figures at all for education . #% In this place we have to be driven by what is actually needed by the people on the ground and by listening to nurses and doctors and healthcare workers , it was important to take their views into account . #% We will take that decision at the end of the period of reflection , and rightly so . #% They have yet to bring their regulatory and financial structures closer to our own . #% That means : ` do n't rock the boat , guys -- we are all in this together ' . #% I have always told progressive and trade union opponents in the OG of NAFTA that they are missing the point . #% This report represents an unacceptable interference in the governance of individual countries , and I reject the approach entirely . #% The common position is , in fact , quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems . #% We have to make sure that there is an economic dynamism that shows we can be competitive in the global economy . #% I am speaking here on behalf of Mrs Roth-Behrendt , as her father died yesterday and she has had to return home . #% I am not talking about the standard blood transfusion service that comes around to your church hall and you pop in for half an hour , have a cup of tea , and go back to work . #% Having said all that I am a believer in subsidiarity . #% The Kaliningrad question is settled now and work on visa-free or flexible travel to the EU should commence once a readmission agreement is struck . #% These are essential . #% We accepted paragraph 8 since we support a sensible rationalisation of working languages for essential cross-border cooperation between professionals such as judges and prosecutors on matters like extradition warrants . #% I personally , although accepting the democratic victory of Hamas -- after all , Hitler was also elected democratically -- continue to regard it as a banned terrorist organisation , as does the European Union and the USA , and therefore would never countenance supporting any funds for it until it convincingly changes its charter and terrorist ideology . #% In my view , an injustice has been done to them . #% 
I think we know the answer and the answer is ` no ' . #% It is clearly a problem for this House . #% Can we still use deca in a sensible and serious way ? #% I spoke with Mr Hilary Benn on Sunday about this very matter when we were at Remembrance Day in Leeds . #% I have argued several times in committee that civil liberties issues that accompany this particular type of technology are a grave threat to people 's everyday lives . #% So when I tell them that they bureaucrats over the water have made us citizens of Europe , most of my mates say ` thank ' e very much guvnor , but we 'm Devon folk and we 'm British , we do n't need that Europe over here , thank ' e kindly ' . #% This particular report is concerned with funding programmes , which was an important initiative from this Parliament a few years ago . #% The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report . #% Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year . #% I think we can all agree that where nuclear power stations and nuclear installations are concerned , it is absolutely essential that safety , safety of operation , safety of construction and design , be given top priority . #% There are some lessons that have to be learned . #% We must be mindful that whatever burden is relieved in one place is not just moved to another . #% Mr Blair hopes that he can reform the European Union in order to make it more palatable to the people . #% The problems of people wanting asylum , the situation and the plight of the people of poor and troubled countries all over the world are our concerns and they manifest themselves on our doorsteps , on our shores and in our parliaments if we do not address them . #% . -- Mr President , the tragic South Asian tsunami heightened public awareness , for the first time , of the possibility of similar extreme events threatening our homes and livelihoods . #% Bulgaria has acted throughout in a manner supportive of European Union and NATO policies , but the regional instability has inevitably had an impact on the Bulgarian economy and on investor confidence in the region . #% So far , unfortunately , this has simply not taken place . #% Within the oral question there were six specific questions and there was also an additional verbal question which was : will the Council discuss this with Parliament ? #% I hope that the European Parliament will respond to the appetite for democracy in the Arab world as a whole . #% Thus , we would say : by all means have an enquiry , but first let us have a wide-ranging review of all Member States ' systems for dealing with food and health scares , starting with an evaluation of the British system . #% We have seen this in relation to this proposal on noise and the parallel proposal on vibration . #% Mr President , George Bernard Shaw once remarked that England and America are two countries divided by a common language . #% So it is time to start listening to us . #% I echo the call of the European people to put an end to poverty and inequality through the implementation of effective , inclusive and forward-looking strategies that fight proactively against global poverty . #% This is a global , not a national , phenomenon . #% We are working with the other applicant countries to help them meet the Copenhagen criteria . #% It is a moral issue ; human health will be protected , because after the deadlines for the end of animal testing , new cosmetic products simply can not be put on the market until alternative testing methods are in place . #% I would also like to have addressed my thanks to the Council , but of course they are not here . #% We have enough trouble at the moment with the normal judiciary . #% Politicians also have another role and that is representing the views of the electorate to decision-makers . #% We would therefore support the Commission 's proposal . #% The European Parliament 's rights of decision on the budget , including the long-term financial perspectives , are among its most fundamental rights . #% The death penalty is still carried out in democracies such as the United States . #% We must encourage them to learn about others and about the European Union , as well as developing their own values , ideas and skills . #% We do not benefit from eating strawberries which have passed their natural span simply because they can be artificially preserved . #% I have two questions about Rwanda . #% At the second stage we need to ensure that we have proper compliance with the standards laid down in the first stage and there should be a possibility to exclude people who have not toed the line in the past in relation to those social and employment standards . #% In conclusion , I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla very much , because we asked for a statement on the posting of workers directive as part of the compromise for removing Articles 24 and 25 of the proposal , and he has given us that . #% This arises because we have agreed with the other institutions two different deadlines for Parliament to object to implementing measures being taken by the Commission . #% I was wrong . #% It arises from the proper observance of the rights of natural justice and the presumption of innocence , and also from our strong desire not in a precipitate fashion to release details into the public domain which could then compromise the integrity of a case or cases we may wish to bring against individuals . #% But , given the difficulties that we all know have been encountered there , I think the Commission deserves support in negotiating some of these bilateral agreements . #% I therefore ask the House to support the deletion of category of animal as a compulsory labelling requirement , just as it did on the first reading . #% Maybe we should also consider that some people might talk about applying the precautionary principle to new treatments . #% The whole population is suffering , and intimidation is undermining democracy in Pakistan . #% The French Presidency took the initiative but I hope my report has improved upon that initiative in a way that will be seen to be fair and reasonable in dealing with what is undoubtedly a very difficult problem . #% Let me just refer to something Mr Perry said . #% Again , if we are not careful , we are going to inflict hardship on animals that do not deserve it . #% That certainly is an area that is proposed in this report and is a responsibility at a European level . #% Equitable Life is the world 's oldest assurance company ; right up to the end of 1999 , even Westminster MPs ' pension funds were still being invested in the company . #% Mr President , I wanted to catch your eye before Mr Folias started , because I believe that all of us here would like to write into the record before the debate that we are recommencing this debate ten hours - I repeat , ten hours - after it was first started . #% But where it does occur , those responsible should make amends . #% Of course there are times in an animal 's life cycle when such dietary additions can be very valuable , such as when a cow is in calf . #% I do not want to see the culling of wild birds but I would like to see every alternative explored . #% Only this morning , Mr Barroso said that he did not like opt-outs , but was in favour of compromises to respect diversity . #% Until that situation is reached , the idea of an internal market in energy is a political mirage . #% For those that have lost land and property to development by Valencian authorities a new law should establish as a matter of urgency a legal administrative structure with the power to review development plans and to assess proper compensation for victims . #% I walk into the Chamber and here he is ! #% Mr President , I am sorry that Mr Borrell is not in the Chair . #% I urge the European Council to show the same vigour and determination as Mr Barroso . #% But above all it is a crisis for the European Union . #% I represent an area where a third of the population are of non-English origin and many are not UK citizens . #% The Commissioner mentioned blind people : the European Blind Union - part of the European Disability Forum , the representative body of disabled people - wants us to give priority to organisations of disabled people . #% This is really something that is quite unnecessary I would have thought in the post cold-war environment . #% Mr President , while I am going to be speaking about the Duff report , I would like to congratulate both Mr Duff and Professor MacCormick for the very substantial amount of work they have put into this . #% Typically , such incinerators deal with animal waste from the agriculture sector and with the disposal of empty pesticide containers at a rate of less than 50 kg an hour . #% 
I am very pleased the Council has adopted that . #% These systems are still intact and throttling the Iraqi people . #% It is a lesson for us in the future that , as politicians and parliamentarians , we should focus on simplification and minimum regulation . #% Separately they will be less valuable , taken together they represent a democratic assault on the lies , the smears and the shameless mendacity perpetrated by much of the tobacco industry , much of which is beyond , and hostile to , the European Union . #% It was interesting to note that most of his was based upon the American Constitution , his interpretation of it and his delivery of decisions based upon it . #% Mr President , it was a point of order from earlier on . #% It will deliver its findings in the first half of 1998 . #% Those are broad-ranging provisions that will develop as services expand . #% For consumers to benefit from this choice , they have to be encouraged to shop around , to compare in many cases what can be quite complex offers of prices and contract terms and service packages . #% Millions of chickens are imported from China and Thailand . #% Is this a case of being two-faced , saying one thing here and nothing back home ? #% We have just decided not to amend the Rules of Procedure and therefore , not to add this new Rule . #% I asked for this information in committee , but I was not entirely satisfied with the answer . #% I logged on to a website this afternoon , which would have given me the opportunity to go to Tanzania . #% Otherwise , this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect . #% Its illegitimate , brutal and dangerous government must be dealt with firmly . #% We have to see these two reports - the Theato and Wemheuer reports - as a coherent response to a single problem ; the Wemheuer report addressed to the Commission , the follow-up to your conference addressed primarily to the Member States . #% Yet again in this House , we find ourselves discussing the appalling human rights situation in that Islamic Republic . #% That is not what this European Parliament wants . #% My countrymen want an honest answer to the question of what the EU thinks it is and what happened to the concept of trade . #% I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Paulsen on the inclusive way that she has approached the other groups on this issue and in particular the practical improvements that have been suggested . #% . First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn and the officials DG Enlargement for the serious and assiduous way in which they have been guiding and monitoring Bulgaria 's progress towards accession . #% We can not let this decision pass by without raising the same objection that we expressed earlier . #% Through cost-benefit analyses we will take steps to assess whether specific actions achieve their objectives , what their impact was compared to the quantity of expenditure allocated , and what European added value they contributed . #% That has meant a new grading structure and a new appraisal system . #% It seems to me that we need a priority-setting , forward-thinking agenda , which is why we are supporting the idea of a study , so that we in the Budgets Committee should have an idea where the money is coming from . #% That must continue and include freedom of the press -- not closing down newspapers , as we have seen in some countries . #% When it was agreed upon in 2002 , it was with the understanding from all sides that this measure , which would have the effect of EU citizens standing trial and being held in prison in another Member State , would be swiftly followed by measures guaranteeing their fair trial rights and guaranteeing there would be no miscarriages of justice . #% For these reasons I voted to support this motion of censure because it is unacceptable that the Commission should continue to evade responsibility for its actions and vital that it should continue properly to police the funds which the taxpayer entrusts to it . #% Perhaps we need to think in similar terms when it comes to the social responsibilities of enterprises like Michelin . #% Just two days ago , a communication from the G77 reiterated that position . #% However , the Council will know that Turkey is being rather obstructive and has carried this over into NATO and is threatening to block certain moves there if these negotiations go ahead without the North being involved . #% In our discussions with the Commission on this report , the Commission explained that it would be too onerous and complicated to meet an initial demand made by myself and others for specific reports on the implementation of telecoms law in the accession countries . #% The question of the independence of the national regulatory authorities is one on which this Parliament has commented on many occasions . #% People escaping from the worst situations do not need to be detained in prisons , detention centres and I agree with Mr Watson on this . #% So we are taking a step in the right direction and I am happy to support the amendments and the report . #% -- Mr President , in recent weeks , amid the appalling loss of life and humanitarian misery in the Middle East , it has been difficult to see any shaft of light . #% Mr Adam may try and blame everything on the farmers as usual - and he talked much about the farmers getting it wrong - but what about the government getting it wrong ? #% I thank Mr McMahon for raising this . #% This welcome Commission communication identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the first framework period , which is now coming to a close , and points to both the challenges and opportunities which can be foreseen , offering a positive and clear new framework . #% As the rapporteur on the Schengen border code , I believe that we did set the precedent for close and effective cooperation . #% We know that the protections of our free society have consistently been abused by extremists who live in Britain while supporting , financing and recruiting for a host of well-known terrorist organisations . #% Mr President , I can happily live with this resolution which calls for a study , if only because a study might actually show that some of the wilder allegations of job losses are perhaps greatly exaggerated . #% There can be no morality without practicality . #% We are convinced that such a focus on quality is essential in order to compensate for a lack of quantity in budgetary means . #% The Commissioner 's own economists suggest that investment must rise to 25 % of GDP . #% Mr President , I start with the Commission 's work programme for 2001 . #% I then discover that people are opposed to this type of research . #% This business could not exist in the EU . #% Despite this comment the rapporteur put forward even more detailed amendments and then blithely stated in the September debate : `` This is a small - to medium-sized business-friendly piece of legislation '' . #% The rapid development of the audio-visual media has brought many real benefits in terms of education , spreading greater awareness of public affairs around the world , and not least in the field of entertainment . #% Mr President , it is with some regret that I must disagree slightly with my colleague , Mr Katiforis . #% If drug companies price medicines beyond the reach of people who need them , governments can override patents without the fear of retribution . #% One of the problems while discussing the Spencer report has been that we are looking backwards to the working of the CFSP in the last year , knowing full well that the world we are discussing is going to change . #% At one time this institution took its work on health and safety subjects very seriously , but a rather worrying trend has developed in relation to recent directives . #% In real terms I would argue that it is nothing more than a stagnation . #% I wish that I could imagine that these are the last 17 , 000 jobs we will lose in that sector . #% First , Taoiseach , I look forward to working with Minister Martin on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , which is crucially important at a time of global disease threats and the threat of bioterrorism . #% It ignores the moral outrage which has been expressed so often in the past . #% Certainly the British people , and the people of many other countries , do not wish to subsume their nationhood into some state called Europe . #% However , we are grateful that Foreign Ministers have finally caught up with world opinion . #% Mr President , I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency . #% But I do have a question since the Commission was not responsible for negotiating on behalf of the EU when it came to the criminal enforcement chapter which was dealt with by the Council on behalf of Member States . #% They have been imprisoned since 3 November and they are yet to be tried . #% In this context , I think we also need to take on board that we are getting people coming into our continent . #% Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your comments . #% 
We also agreed to uphold the effective right of conscientious objection on the grounds of religion or belief - a right internationally acknowledged . #% Without an interinstitutional agreement we go back to Article 203 and Agenda 2000 is dead . #% Did the Commission seek explicit prior consent of Parliament and Council to the extension before it was finally agreed ? #% Mr President , my thanks and congratulations go to the rapporteur . #% So , it is important to open up the possibility of more flexible use across the whole of the radio spectrum without ruling out certain frequencies . #% As we have heard , 139 governments have signed the Rome Treaty yet sadly only 27 have ratified it . #% I pressed the button with Mr Lomas ' card in it . #% That implies that we need to be confident that every country 's legal system is up to scratch and meets the minimum standards set down in the European Convention on Human Rights . #% We also need to look at providing small-scale industrial units for starter firms in our rural areas . #% We believe that consideration of the use of depleted uranium should be based on scientific fact . #% But is it really necessary ? #% There is no suggestion whatsoever that there should be any legal trade or trafficking in human organs -- quite the opposite . #% Mr Belder calls for a consistent and coherent policy towards China . #% The aforementioned relates to Tuesday and I request that it be included in the minutes for that day . #% What will you be doing to ensure that those two things occur ? #% It is important to respect the rule of international humanitarian law , even when it is inconvenient for governments . #% There is much greater clarity as regards the need for adequate legal representation and an individual interview , which assumes even greater importance in the context of the single asylum procedure currently under consideration . #% A four-year transposition period - five years transition and then the possibility of extra time beyond that . #% I have heard of some of the practices in France at the moment . #% The British Government should have told the EU to get lost . #% Equal pensions for women should be guaranteed , and it is for this reason I supported the proposal to ensure the same rights for women in the case of pensions and social security . #% I do not make an argument for being insulated against the representations and judgment of Parliament or of the Council which represents the taxpayers . #% However , I would conclude by asking : which is going to come first ? #% Mr President , I am sure I speak for more or less everybody in the Chamber this afternoon when I say that we believe culture does not get enough money . #% I can say that because I represent the area of the UK that has the highest level of unemployment outside Northern Ireland . #% While endorsing the communication on ` Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners ' , we are also examining these two regulations . #% Therefore the conclusion has to be that the opt-out must stay and abuses , if any , must go . #% I particularly welcome the comment that whilst healthcare is a matter for Member States , nonetheless we can all learn a great deal from each other . #% Article 3a , referred to earlier by the rapporteur , shows what can be done to keep the widest audience for special events . #% Thirdly , violence against women should be universally regarded as unacceptable . #% The request is withdrawn . #% But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement . #% We are not talking about expensive duties being imposed on employers . #% The West must now be prepared to extend the mandate of Turkish-led ISAF forces beyond this December at the UN and extend their remit to Afghan provinces as well , to end the warlordism and extend the government 's authority in the provinces as part of the nation-building exercise and construct a national army and police force and distribute much needed aid to a desperately poor country . #% That is a general rule that is understood and upheld by democrats everywhere , but in the case of the Commission as an employing institution , as I pointed out earlier , there is an additional implication that if a Commission official is attacked and if it is a Commission official in a specific case who has been acquitted under due process of a charge , than that official can make claims upon the Commission and therefore on taxpayers ' money under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations in order to fight that case of alleged defamation . #% Madam President , as you know many of us are very concerned with the prestige and reputation of this Parliament and for that reason I rise in connection with the procedures concerning the lifting of Mr Berlusconi 's immunity . #% I am glad that as a British Conservative she has acted in a European fashion . #% The Irish presidency should certainly press forward quickly to seek to complete the IGC . #% It is praiseworthy that the Commission is looking to play a leading , pivotal role in this , and I commend the Commission proposals and my own report to you . #% There have been numerous problems and delays , meaning that the new system has still not begun operation . #% Such tests must distinguish between genuine medication and performance-enhancing drugs . #% The pursuit of greater accountability and control of the EU budget and dramatically improved management by the Commission ; the need for the European Parliament to have the power to dismiss individual Commissioners ; #% Iran has borne a major burden , Jordan has large numbers , Syria enormous numbers too and Turkey also , not to mention other countries in the region . #% The EU must work closely with the US to stabilise this process . #% I refer to Commissioner Monti 's 36 market reports detailing the sources of Europe 's 900 , 000 new jobs , which are directly attributable to Europe 's noble exercise of implementing a magic market . #% The initial fear of a separation between the ins and pre-ins is being overtaken by the logic of the screening process and the EU 's pre-accession strategy . #% I support the phase out of dangerous and unnecessary additives . #% This includes EU funding for alcohol and tobacco production , which conflicts with the EU 's health objectives , and EU agricultural export subsidies , which harm developing countries , as well as increases in budget lines relating to expenses , travel , publications and other administrative costs . #% Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum , they reject it . #% When the allegations came out ten days ago , we were told that Member States would be informally questioned , that technical experts from the relevant directorate would be in contact with their counterparts in the 25 Member States , plus 4 candidate countries . #% In the last few days we have seen a reminder of the nature of Saddam 's regime with the discovery of yet another mass grave . #% It may be of interest to the honourable Member and the House to know that , at the moment , 566 officials of the Commission are on personal leave . #% I am suspicious of those who would use the challenges of environment as an argument for delay in enlargement . #% Anything less will mean funding delays , short deadlines , rushed projects for the next seven years . #% We must ensure that it also returns to that issue as regards the extension of the field of qualified majority voting because anything that requires unanimity in a Union of more than 20 Member States will be subject to paralysis . #% My final point is just to say that in the future this process of scrutiny must continue and I look forward to the information campaign on food safety which DG XXIV is planning for 1998 . #% Conservatives , on balance , welcome the process and expect a similar outcome this time . #% So please , with that sort of political nous that you have , could you just answer a handful of very short questions for me ? #% I would like to associate myself with the comments made by Mr Stubb and Mrs Bowles , but I would like to talk about transparency in these issues . #% According to the notification we have received in a specific instance in so far as the Danish authorities are concerned , the working time directive has been implemented by a combination of both statutory provisions and collective agreements . #% Now we look forward to the proof that in the future the UN will be able to avoid those failures that we so tragically saw in Bosnia and Rwanda . #% Iran is continuing to fund terrorist groups such as Hizbollah who are active in the Middle East . #% Technology can not be allowed to take liberty by the throat . #% Mr President , a number of countries around the world have reintroduced Sharia law in recent years , including parts of Nigeria . #% The problem is that at the moment we simply do not know what the right practices are . #% Those forecasts appear as an admirably clear table covering the years 2006 to 2016 and allowing for EUR 78 million of taxpayers ' money over this period to support the Agency . #% 
Their processing needs to take place with all urgency , and the international community should be invited to help . #% However , we have grave reservations about the adequacy of this resolution in tackling the root causes that lead to human trafficking and hence we have chosen to vote against . #% On a personal level I welcome the report . #% This highlights the appalling state of affairs that we now see with the present regime in power in Pakistan . #% In particular we want to consider the problems that the Treaty of Amsterdam presents and the fact that the full financial implications of the Treaty of Amsterdam are only being realised this year and we have to take account of that . #% Business is disrupted and delayed . #% No farmer uses pesticides for fun - after all , they are expensive . #% Despite these breaches , resolution 1441 gives Iraq one final chance , a slender window of opportunity that it seems to be refusing to open . #% At the moment it is only worth a whisper . #% Finally , again on this question of impartiality , we have heard within the last couple of weeks that the Israeli defence force has ordered the confiscation of more Palestinian land to build the roads to enable the building of the E1 settlement - the further expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem - against every commitment we have requested the Israelis to make , and against every hope there could be for a genuine outcome from the forthcoming peace talks . #% It is going to give us a free market , liberal economics and the solution to all our woes . #% This means that the Commission and Council must rapidly finalise the EU position on the four remaining chapters : competition , regional policy , agriculture and budget . #% But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2 % threshold . #% If the British Presidency does not secure a deal on the future budget perspectives , it will not be regarded as a success . #% However , if the US does not tolerate torture inside or outside the United States , why is it resisting the McCain amendment ? #% However convincing the industry 's arguments may be now , they will look pretty weak in years to come . #% I hear what colleagues say about their security concerns , but I stand here as somebody who narrowly survived the Mumbai attacks and I say to those colleagues : this is not the time to turn your back on Pakistan . #% At the moment , a number of half-truths seem to be circulating . #% Pakistan is not only a developing country with 170 million inhabitants and strategic borders with Afghanistan ; it is also a country which has some thirty nuclear warheads . #% We in Parliament have to give our assent and we will scrutinise the final treaties very closely . #% As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control , my role has always been to look into where the money has been lost or misused and where mistakes have been made -- the phrase that Mr Kallas has just used . #% He went on to say the application of the EU regulations will be intelligent and selective . #% To the Commission I would say that public relations exercises are all fine . #% What is being done on 1 January to mark the 30th anniversary of the accession of these three great countries ? #% I have heard that some in the Commission believe that they have managed to squeeze more out of Member States in the past six months than they had in the previous six years . #% We would be much better concentrating our efforts in the next few years on recycling , re-use and other methods of reducing the waste heap . #% If the Commission does not know the answer , what trust can we have in its watchdog function as data protection comes under increasing pressure ? #% It should be ruled inadmissible . #% I should be grateful , therefore , if you would contact the appropriate authorities and make sure , firstly , that nothing like this ever happens again and , secondly , that the French police concerned are given appropriate retraining in the rights and responsibilities of parliamentarians . #% Mr President , it would have been nice if I could have praised the rapporteur for her work . #% I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on - largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned . #% It is happening so fast that from the consumers ' point of view , they really do not care too much whether they make their telephone call from a fixed point or a mobile , as long as they get through efficiently and cheaply and can make their calls . #% I just need a ruling on that and to know which rule you will be speaking to . #% As this report suggests , we clearly need a radical shake-up of world trade rules . #% In the Caribbean alone the losses as a result of the cuts are expected to be in the region of EUR 125 million . #% On the one hand we have good laws and a new strategy to outlaw discrimination against people as employees and consumers . #% I welcome that , but I think it is now more important than ever , Commissioner , that that process becomes much more transparent about the line the Commission is taking on negotiating those directives which are being done in another body , a UN body , and not within this House . #% Commissioner Wallström is always welcome to the stage , but she may understand that we are a little disappointed that the Commissioner designated -- to whom we tabled this question -- is not here to answer it . #% The situation is that the majority of the population -- its women -- face vicious discrimination . #% It is not a reflection on the hard work and dedication of the staff who are employed in slaughterhouses . #% Therefore , unless steps are taken to reach an international standard sooner rather than later , there could well be problems ahead . #% It is destroying lives and livelihoods . #% When employment rates are considered , we all too often concentrate our minds on the macroeconomic environment whereas individual local employment markets contribute considerably to the overall well-functioning and dynamism of the economy . #% Mr President , nine months after the euro ' s launch and with enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency dimmed as the result of exchange rate weakness , it can not be heralded as an unqualified success . #% Therefore this Parliament has sometimes suggested that some form of Northern Dimension forum , bringing in all the stakeholders and elected representatives , would be a good idea for the future . #% That is the best we can do with the science we have . #% That leads to the second requirement , which is one of responsibility . #% Whilst I refer to the Commissioner , I would also like to draw her attention in particular to our paragraph 14 of this resolution where we invite the Commission to consider expanding aid to Pakistan for education , poverty reduction , healthcare and relief work , but channelling the funds through secular NGOs rather than directly to the government under these circumstances . #% I agree with almost everything he says . #% I hope we can live up to that . #% It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for taking on board so much of the previous internal market committee report , for which I had the privilege of being a rapporteur . #% This is the main reason for the anger and resentment felt towards the Common Fisheries Policy . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn for her hard work on this difficult issue and I would broadly like to support the conclusions tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , and to thank my colleagues on that committee for the hard work they have put in . #% At times it appears to be addictive , as that list gets longer and longer . #% All the crew should have the skills necessary to ensure that the plane , for example , is evacuated as quickly and effectively as possible . #% I welcome the amendment that supports a change in OIE rules so that there is no longer an automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate . #% The Convention itself is old : it antedates my own country ' s joining the European Economic Community . #% But I think we can make one certain prediction : in a few years ' time - about the most accurate forecast - we can expect that more people across Europe and the world will be connected to the Internet through a wireless device than through any other mechanism . #% I agree with calls for the EU to provide more funding through the ESF in order to help combat poverty and social exclusion - it is vital that women are fully integrated into the labour market . #% Seventy per cent of the ` droit de suite ' funds collected in France in 1996 went not to the artists but to the descendants of seven artists , including the relatives of Matisse and Picasso . #% Could I just say that for the first six years I spent in the European Parliament , I was trying to push tourism up the agenda . #% It would certainly not be helpful for the EU to take one side in this matter by some policy of sanctions against Israel , for example . #% Yesterday I received a letter from a constituent who had bought a property in another Member State . #% The need for basic education is the single most important cause of global poverty . #% It should be scrapped and fisheries should be managed once again by national governments . #% 
Occasionally , however , there is a problem such as the E-coli outbreak in Scotland . #% In the light of this , would you now agree that the economic recovery plan agreed last December was not enough in itself ? #% Without doubt aviation has made considerable progress , but I also believe that aviation has a responsibility to its passengers , to its workforce , and also to the environment . #% But quite frankly , we should not accept the call for ` the introduction of modifications ' . #% I would ask for your view of the conduct of the Commission in this regard . #% Thirdly , we want to see a reinstatement of the 20 % reduction proposed by the Commission in sustainable mobility . #% Unlike value added tax , there is little by way of a shared body of knowledge of direct taxation across the EU Member States and different Member States impose indirect taxation in very different ways . #% I have to correct her by telling her that the last time this proposal was dealt with by the Council of Ministers it did not vote it by unanimity , which was why when we rejected it in Parliament they could not reinstate it . #% This is some of the information which I believe in this context should be given to the consumer . #% Mr Van Hecke 's report reminds us that there is much that is wrong with the world and brilliantly focuses us on the need for the European Union to speak with one voice . #% Mr President , the last time I saw a printed copy of the budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 it stood at EUR 336 billion , with a precise allocation budgeted for each of the 25 Member States plus the next two in the queue , Bulgaria and Romania . #% Much of the Sacconi report I entirely endorse . #% It is my understanding , Commissioner , that current proposals , which have been made by the EU in relation to Burma are quite frankly very unlikely to have any impact whatsoever on that regime . #% I think along with all the other issues in the resolution it is very important that those healthcare workers are not subjected to unnecessary needle-stick injuries . #% Of course we have to complete the rest of Agenda 2000 as well but we have to be there for the March Summit . #% Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , I welcome your statement here this morning , but I understand that you went to Thailand and were told that it was not avian flu but chicken cholera . #% Thirdly , Mr Byrne is also responsible for food safety at home and for legislation regarding food labelling . #% This rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches , severely damaging the environment and marine life . #% Society has a duty to organize itself - ourselves - to provide work for all , decent housing and free education . #% However , we are already well down the road to the digital revolution already , and the sort of interference that is being implied by some colleagues here - I am pleased to say not in the resolution - will not help the way forward . #% As has already been mentioned , we must also bring in our other partners , Norway and Iceland . #% I would ask Commissioner Kinnock to take this matter back and to ask the Commission to look at this question again . #% Here we have another opportunity for the Commission to prove exactly that . #% It is that point that I think was so crucial at the time of King Arthur and is going to be crucial not just in the future but now . #% France , Germany and Japan only include pre-cut-off debts and so ignore a significant portion of debt . #% What we need are the measures outlined in our resolution in order to see the real growth and the real jobs that we need in Europe so desperately . #% As you will be aware , many of us are concerned that there will be chaos in European waters if duty-free is abolished . #% Finally , I come to my group 's priorities during the budgetary process . #% I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers . #% In my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favour and one abstention . #% The origin of the groundwater directive is really the impact of landfill sites on groundwater quality . #% We talk glibly about taking on the `` acquis communautaire ' , for example . #% Unfortunately , this agreement does not fully follow the Aarhus Convention as it does not allow the public to be fully involved in the development of policy which frames planning decisions . #% I also believe it to be one of the most sophisticated Middle Eastern societies , with an inherent tendency towards progress and modernity . #% We have to be very careful that we design the regime in such a way as to ensure that we do not discourage them from doing that , because we want not only consumers to go online but also businesses to put their products online , and to make the two work together , because that is what we have the opportunity to do in our dynamic e-commerce market as it moves forward from here . #% This has been mentioned by previous speakers this morning and I spoke on this subject during our debate last month . #% We also note the lack of political will that exists within both the Commission and the Council , although it is worth perhaps reminding ourselves that this initiative started with the Council in June last year when it requested the Commissioner to bring forward this communication . #% A second concern of ours is this key principle , which we support and which needs to be developed further , namely the separation of regulation from service providers . #% The EPP Group supports the main line of this report . #% Put simply , increased trade boosts a nation 's economy , raising its GDP . #% It may well be that we do not even allow any overlapping into the year 2007-2008 on the spend if it gets further behind . #% With reference to the Ruffolo report on certain external aspects of the euro , I would corroborate the rapporteur 's concern regarding the external representation of the European Community on bodies like , for instance , the IMF . #% Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission . #% It is a very small minority specialist market and Europe brings itself into disrepute by delegitimising , by banning , by forcing out of business , a small number of very entrepreneurial and gifted craftsmen . #% Free trade is not the same as . #% The other prong of his approach concerns the terminology or vocabulary , for instance regulations should in future be called ` laws ' and directives in future should be called ` framework laws ' . #% This calls for all of us to make some highly subjective decisions . #% So we have not been looking at a ` one size fits all ' solution , but we have looked to establish values and principles and guidelines for Member States to develop a European framework of shared goals and shared values and shared entitlements . #% In the last 20 years we have seen this question of enlargement go together with the deepening of the Union . #% It is a recipe for the activism of the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice in its agenda to enforce the social market economy and undermine the Thatcherite economic reforms of the 1980s which made my country a magnet for foreign direct investment . #% This does not mean that the Commission should lead only individual Member States towards the promised land , it should also lead each individual Commissioner . #% What occurred by the late weeks of May last year was a very manifest and severe breakdown in working relationships , which meant that action had to be taken with rapidity simply because delay would have prolonged the difficulty without bringing any prospect of reconciliation . #% I am now a group of one so that gives us something in common . #% That is crucial , particularly for churches in the United Kingdom , many of which are listed . #% Whilst I share your aims and always want to do things as quickly as we can - and Mr Kirkhope 's aims of price transparency and consumer protection - I think that , in our speed to get this through , we have drifted away , certainly from the position that the Committee on Transport adopted at the end of May , and that the position that Council has come up with , the so-called compromise position , is different from the position that we went for in the Committee on Transport . #% Before we move into the detail of the extended impact assessment there is also a stage for considering the whole strategy of the legislation , its objectives , a clear definition of those objectives , and the tools by which those objectives would be achieved . #% I would emphasise the need for training in farm diversification , including low-volume products for niche markets , and cooperative marketing techniques where , by coming together , individual farms can seek to match the commercial bargaining strength of the supermarket chains . #% Accordingly , Mr Bösch 's amendments which have been adopted by the committee include questioning the mission expenses of OLAF , questioning their information and communication measures - having received a reasonable amount of money for this purpose , the office put out less than twelve press releases in both 2000 and 2001 - and indeed questioning both the Commission and OLAF over a cut . #% Your actions mean that you have become the aggressor , not the victim . #% While the voluntary partnership agreements conceived under the 2003 FLEGT Action Plan have the potential to drive positive change , to date only one has been signed and , as long as their coverage is not universal , the risks of money-laundering and circumvention are just too high . #% Today , just 4 000 white farmers still own over 70 % of the arable land while more than seven million black Zimbabweans scratch a living from overcrowded communal areas . #% I trust that the Commission will do just that . #% The globalisation of markets and the decreased competitiveness of traditional sectors call for the diversification of economic activities and an exploration of new means of creating job opportunities . #% Amendment 7 offers an alternative mechanism to achieve the optimal use of fishing opportunities and one that does not give rise to such problems . #% Those Member States therefore have a special responsibility to take action and to ensure that they get themselves up to the EU average as quickly as possible . #% I hope we will see more of him , not least because he would help us achieve in justice and home affairs the equivalent of the Lisbon objective to make Europe the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world . #% 
The provisions in this text to protect minority shareholders are important and will encourage more cross-border portfolio share ownership . #% The Lisbon Agenda . #% The European Union should never leave it to the United States to take the lead . #% We must let the market decide what the future of the airline industry shall be . #% There are those who are alleging that the European Union has become an over-centralised monstrosity ; that we need to take powers back to the Member States ; that we should define a catalogue of competences specifying in great detail what the EU is allowed and not allowed to do . #% Not one of 650 jobs at the port of Tilbury would be safe . #% It is always important to distinguish between asylum and immigration : those are two separate issues , the latter of which is covered by the 1951 Geneva Convention . #% Our amendments are aimed , above all , at ensuring that the European Union can be , as it should be , a properly responsive partner . #% Neither is it true that torture has completely stopped , in spite of it being banned by the State ; it is still allegedly being used against Kurdish insurgents , and we have heard about that from Mrs Flautre . #% Just as momentum is needed in the reform process for Turkey , momentum is needed in its membership talks with the European Union too . #% We also have to bear in mind that we are still negotiating with countries which are sovereign , independent states and we have to respect their internal procedures . #% There is no doubt that the committee 's report underlines the scale of what was the world 's worst ever foot and mouth outbreak . #% These arrangements will be very different in many cases from conventional buying contracts , although , as I indicated in my response to Mrs McCarthy 's report , there is increasing interest in more transparent conditions for these types of contracts . #% In other words , that statistic alone suggests there is very little commercial risk for either the European pharmaceuticals industry , or the US industry itself . #% In particular I want to state two points . #% We should celebrate it . #% Recently , prisoners have been allegedly executed at the Adi Abeto military prison and the government of Sudan -- itself a government not known for respect for human rights -- now accuses Eritrea of aiding the Darfur rebels and their groupings . #% We do need a fallback position , and fundamentally that must be to drive forward our energy efficiency . #% It is the one opportunity we have to question the Council on issues of concern to us and our constituents . #% The calls for a specific European legal base infringe the principle of subsidiarity . #% Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra is not listening to me now , but he said a few moments ago that we should stand firm in demanding freedom . #% The Greens strongly support re-use as an important way to reduce the environmental impact of packaging , but we share the reservations expressed by others about trying to tackle that in this directive by amending a recital . #% With the satellite agencies eternal vigilance is certainly the key as far as we are concerned . #% Fortunately two or three Members ( and the Commission as well ) did read them . #% We must ensure that the agreements work and that any breaches are monitored and addressed . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this very reluctantly . #% Good rail access into ports is vital in this context . #% If Europe 's airlines are to stay competitive with their American counterparts , they can not afford to shoulder the additional burden that 11 September has thrown at them . #% It is that window of opportunity that we must take advantage of today . #% I wonder if this would not lead to more of the inconsistency and the conflict with the Commission that we have at present . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues support strongly the principle of upholding and developing human rights . #% The NGOs have reported continuing attacks , again this week , on women collecting firewood . #% Do we need a new DG to do that ? #% North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military flashpoints on the globe . #% Page 6 of the recommendation draws a parallel with the Coal and Steel Community and how it started the EEC as it then was . #% As the rapporteur , Mr Wieland , has pointed out in his excellent report , this directive is primarily about procedures as they relate to the recognition of diplomas . #% I ask this Chamber to consider for one moment the effect of just one Scud missile with chemical weapons aimed at Israel . #% Many of them are and Peter Skinner has put a lot of thought into his work . #% Nothing Mr Schulz has just said would help any of the five million presently unemployed in his country . #% The Commission explicitly committed itself , in that interinstitutional agreement , to explain fully today when it presents its annual legislative programme , firstly the choice of legislative instrument for each proposal , and secondly the choice of legal base . #% That is why we ask the House to support our amendment earmarking EUR 500 million for Iraq . #% There are three or four main reasons . #% That is why the amendments about training , monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive . #% As with so many EU initiatives - I am thinking particularly of the proposed food standards agency - this observatory will simply duplicate the work of other organisations , of innumerable private research companies and accountancy firms , of academic and university institutes , of trade unions and chambers of commerce , and national and local government . #% Sadly , others who shared my view could not be present on that occasion . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission , but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words - which I very much agree with - when are we going to have real action ? #% We have had to find legally sound ways to extend those provisions up to 2007 , in cooperation with our friends and colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% Mr President , following Lisbon and Nice , I had hoped to see a better balance in the Commission 's work programme between employment , economic and social policies , but I do not see much evidence of that . #% Therefore , I do not think the conspiracy theory is a correct analysis . #% The lobbying of lawyers ' organisations against this common position has been somewhat exaggerated . #% This of course is not the case . #% These are the thoughts that are going through a lot of people 's minds . #% We shall all be happier still when we can use them with a clear conscience , knowing that unnecessary animal testing has gone for good . #% No new chapter has been opened for eight months , the longest period since the talks were first launched . #% Mr President , I moved my seat closer to the centre because at this late hour I think we should all huddle together for comfort . #% Formally , the Rules of Procedure permit elected Members present to put supplementary questions to the President-in-Office of the Council . #% in writing . - I am encouraged that the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Commission are confident that negotiations for Croatia 's accession to the EU can be concluded this year . #% I am increasingly of the view that to understand what Parliament 's Bureau actually does and decides you have to be a Kremlinologist to read their minutes and get any meaning out of them . #% These people have been threatened with expulsion owing to their activities in drawing world attention to these problems because the country concerned fears that that will affect its trade , or some other aspect of its relations . #% I wish to ask the President-in-Office to give the public confidence that , of course , we must be scrupulous ; but it is not somebody else 's fault : it is our Member States ' fault . #% You know that this is the most important instrument . #% However , I would like to congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras very much on the splendid set of amendments which he has produced with the other shadow rapporteurs in compromise . #% They are two peoples who must coexist as neighbours or offer their grandchildren the prospect of eternal feuding . #% On transparency , I had an interesting time when I asked Parliament 's officials if they could let me have a list of what the Commission had done on the 2000 budget in relation to those items to which Parliament had adopted amendments to the budget , in terms of both amounts of money and also remarks . #% We would point out ; however , that the compromise deal struck between the parties fails to adequately address the problems that confront the European Union today . #% Like others , I regret that we do not have a resolution in front of us in which we could have expressed our complete condemnation of police brutality and of the violence of the Black Block at Genoa , our conviction that those responsible must be brought to justice , our commitment to uphold the right to protest peacefully , and our determination to clarify the growing evidence that much of the violence and damage to property which occurred in Genoa was the work of agents provocateurs . #% 
That document for Rio contains some very good points , especially the emphasis on providing incentives for environmentally and socially sustainable trade . #% Issues like health insurance , legal insurance , insurance for motor accidents , accidents in the home , etc. , all make people feel that bit more safe and secure that , should any tragedy occur , they will be covered financially . #% Most importantly , because there are no conditions , it allows the European Union to proceed , if it wishes - and I hope it does - by tabling a resolution in Geneva at the next session next year to redeem our failure last year : the CFSP came under a lot of criticism because we could not unite on this question . #% It confirms my already high opinion of her parliamentary talents . #% However , we do not hold out too much hope of converting this whole exercise into something which could be really positive in turning back the tide of legislative bureaucracy and over-regulation , and genuinely protecting the human rights of the citizens of Europe . #% Unfortunately - and this is not entirely their fault - they are not coping with the pressures as well as we would wish : we have all had experience of that only recently , as a result of the delays caused by the strike in France . #% We had our own inquiry . #% Following on from the Van Buitenen affair and the Commission 's fairly lamentable reaction to it , is there not a case that these disciplinary boards - and especially those called for whistle-blowers - should be independent of the Commission altogether ? #% We need to make sure that it happens within days rather than weeks . #% Unfortunately , apart from herself and one other Group Vice President from the PPE-DE Group , I was the only representative of our Group there . #% Nevertheless , I am particularly pleased that Mr Barnier has joined us as a very active member of my committee to hear this , because this is a dossier which will be very much in his in-tray , assuming of course that the Parliament approves his nomination and the Commission moves forward . #% We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular World War II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the European Union itself . #% I am also talking about the free movement of goods , whether we are talking about drugs , food products or toys or whatever . #% Mr President , I wish to make a short personal statement of apology to the House . #% It is a good agreement , but it is a little ambiguous in certain parts . #% If , as he says , he has received direct threats from people who purport to be supporters or members of the UK Independence Party , he should forward those names to me immediately , because those people would immediately face disciplinary proceedings and be expelled from our party . #% When will we start to treat European citizens like grown-ups , able to make their own decisions ? #% So , let us see less of the talk of this summit and instead see many more plans for concrete action from Member States . #% They are socialists , they are our sister party and I welcome their manifesto commitment that ` the occupation erodes the moral fibre of Israeli society ' , along with Amir Peretz 's Herzliya speech in support of respect for international borders . #% The decision by the so-called European Court of Justice is nothing less than a judicial . #% But the application of the European Arrest Warrant without proper procedural guarantees has , in some cases , led to the denial of justice , because mutual recognition has not been accompanied by a solid basis for mutual trust . #% We can not have that sort of straight-jacket placed on Member States . #% Is it not the case that serial anti-dumping complaints are themselves damaging to the Community interest given the cost of dealing with the investigations , given the uncertainties which companies are then placed under , which makes it very difficult to engage in any sort of forward planning ? #% The whole idea behind this is that we can purge the budget of those lines which are operating ineffectively , and move towards what we are looking for , which is a positive statement of assurance . #% Some 70 % of south eastern England 's water comes from groundwater resources . #% I am very glad that the Commission will be represented at the meeting in Paris , but I would like to know whether it has plans to encourage the other Member States to go , whether there will be a mechanism for feeding back to Parliament the results of the meeting in Paris , and whether there are plans to share the contents of the workshop that took place on 9 February between the Commission and the Council . #% We are promised that more money will be spent on regional funds , cohesion funds , social funds , globalised funds , fisheries funds , etc. -- all this to gain the trust and commitment of the citizens . #% With those opening remarks , Mr President , I would commend our position to you . #% That is why I am opposed to modulation , because it attacks the large and efficient farms . #% The Commission has indicated that this taxation relief could amount to the unlawful granting of state aid . #% We need regular assessments on what is happening on the ground before we can agree to any renewal of the agreement . #% She has had a very difficult task ; getting a consensus on this issue is impossible . #% Accordingly , they alerted the port authorities at Dover . #% Finally , I wish again to support the amendments that extend the application of this scheme to both the European Parliament and the political groups . #% We hope that the Bonn Conference and the Belgian presidency will be able to move the Europeans on from words to action . #% The Chinese Government must listen to our calls for respect for human rights . #% Women are now forbidden to be presenters on radio or television , which some of them were doing successfully . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , as both the rapporteur and Commissioner Barrot have said , following long negotiations in the conciliation process , Parliament and the Council have finally reached an agreement , which I believe to be positive and worthy of our support . #% All of us would wish to see by 2001 - not in four or five years ' time or ten years ' time but within the space of 18 months - a further review of the safety measures used and of these instruments themselves . #% I generally , though , reject State funding directly for SMEs as the State is generally poor at picking winners amongst competing demands for capital . #% I should also like him to answer the seventh question , which I shall put orally : will the Council sit down with Parliament to discuss this matter in the hope that we can get a resolution to it ? #% However , now science shows that a reduction of the permitted level from 400 mg/l to 350 mg/l is all that is needed . #% My job as Chairman is to make sure that the rights and privileges that we fought for over so many years are maintained , and I intend to do that . #% That conference attracted a large number of non-governmental organisations and stimulated a great deal of creative thinking . #% After all , the latest Eurobarometer , as Mr Poettering will surely know , showed 70 % opposition to Turkish membership in France and 74 % in Germany . #% I know that Mr Mormino has all sorts of qualities but I had never directly associated him with great artistic talent . #% I have had a huge postbag on this proposal and the reactions to it have been very mixed . #% I condemn the Conservative group in this Parliament who sought to remove development considerations from the proposed Standing Forum with the ILO , and incredibly sought to remove from our objectives , achieving `` fair and socially balanced '' as well as free trade . #% When you think about the amount that we , as political parties , spend on our election campaigns to try and persuade people of something different , it is going to take more than the money in the current budget to persuade people that others in their society have rights which should be recognised as well . #% Many developing countries such as poorer countries , and LDCs such as Mozambique and others , see it as a sector which needs to be developed further . #% Strong opinions have been voiced on this issue and unfortunately it has become a symbolic argument , with people digging in on both sides . #% Over the last six years , I have had the privilege to represent this Parliament on a number of parliamentary bodies in the Arctic , Barents and Baltic region . #% We are looking here at a very specific issue in the saga , namely the rights of the Thule workers under Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996 , laying down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation . #% To witness for myself the horror that Israeli citizens have to live with every day was profoundly moving and deeply upsetting . #% May I suggest that the other priorities in the Horn of Africa are the so-called war against terror ? #% For too long the European Union has not paid sufficient attention to the need for a common energy policy . #% The Commissioner must explain how we are expected properly to evaluate a budget which is in itself extremely questionable . #% Last year we held discussions with Shell in this House on their business principles . #% There is supposed to be free movement of workers in the European Union under Article 48 , yet disabled people have very little chance of being able to exercise this full right unless something is done to enhance their status and their capacity to work in the European Union . #% First , if there are 4 million voters registered in Chad and another half million registered abroad , how can 5.6 million people have voted ? #% Mr President , our group was extremely pleased at the result of the vote this morning . #% I am hopeful that the EPP might be able to rally to the main resolution if most of their amendments are accepted in the vote tomorrow . #% A successful , high-skill economy demands that knowledge be available to the many and not the few . #% I strongly deprecate this , and I would ask that at some point in the future , some sort of disciplinary action is taken against those Members . #% Young people , those from minority ethnic groups , the elderly , people with disabilities , the homeless , the mentally ill and many others find themselves excluded in our societies in many different ways . #% Mr President , I wish to draw your attention to the Global Security Fund , set up in the early 1990s under the auspices of Jacob Rothschild . #% 
Why not pencil into the calendar an IGC summit meeting before 1 May ? #% Between 40 and 70 % of those birds die before they are exported and many more die en route to Europe . #% Can the President-in-Office of the Council state categorically that it is opposed to these military tribunals ? #% I hope I am here to see it finally disappear but , in the meantime , I have voted against this measure . #% What do we ask ? #% Finally , just as the recent crisis at Sellafield has been self-inflicted , so the solution to it lies in British Nuclear Fuels ' hands , as they themselves understand . #% I should also like to thank our colleagues , where we have tried our best to find a common approach , recognising the need to treat people as individuals in the process of return and the need for due process and clarity in the law . #% I welcome the fact that he is going to look into this in detail and gather all the relevant information . #% It is , as far as I am concerned - and I agree with the Commissioner - very definitely a measure that should address primarily the issue of air pollution rather than that of health problems associated with those who use paints . #% It is a good example in my view of the sort of European Union venture that my party in the United Kingdom can support so long as it is done on a flexible , intergovernmental basis . #% We do not believe that exact percentages need to be disclosed and note that this goes beyond the provisions applicable to food for human consumption . #% I would have thought that at this , of all times , we ought to take a step back and have a real think about good principles . #% We worked together on this proposal for over a year , beginning in the last Parliament . #% Quite frankly , if we feel that the international police task force does not have enough power then we ought to be looking at how to increase those powers so that they need not stand helplessly watching people being attacked , injured and , even killed . #% This brings with it notable safety improvements and important issues like disability access to all types of buses . #% In conclusion , Romania has much to offer the European Union and the world . #% We would also like to see the involvement of the social partners and small and micro businesses in this initiative . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for all the support she has given to most of Parliament 's ideas . #% I am confident that 1 January 2007 will be D-Day -- delivery day -- for Romania and Bulgaria , when they will receive full membership of the European Union . #% That is just one example of the need for vigilance , prevention and rapid response , just one reason why we must never ` cherry-pick ' in our battle against disease . #% It has appointed a team to work out a road map to peaceful , free and fair elections in Zimbabwe , and today , that team is in Harare . #% I know , for example , that DG II in the European Commission produces reports on the economics of certain major policies that the European Commission may put forward . #% However , there is sufficient evidence in the public domain that appears to contradict what is called for as a solution in this report . #% Consequently , the EU must tread carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid to its long-suffering people . #% It has created a fresh , large consensus behind the project of European integration . #% That is why the Green/EFA Group was one of the instigators of an ITRE own-initiative report on the subject of regional integration , particularly with respect to its potential effects on multilateralism and on efforts to achieve sustainable development . #% As with all outbreaks of this kind , lessons must be learned . #% I would point out that we have nothing to fear from public scrutiny and we have absolutely everything to fear as institutions from hiding information . #% We should now use that stage as a springboard . #% If we do not have a statutory right to interest , if we do not bring forward legislation on this , we are going to sell short our small companies in the European Union . #% Mr President , in relation to the last debate , I can not resist noting that Commissioner Liikanen did not thank those European Union football teams who have made a thankless contribution to helping decrease the likelihood of transmitting foot-and-mouth disease from South Korea by departing from the competition early . #% I have no doubt whatsoever that if the perpetrators of war crimes in Bosnia had known that there was a likelihood that they would be found out and punished we would never have seen the descent into the sort of barbarism we have witnessed . #% Now , with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Commission report which we are debating today , we should move towards a situation where human rights is much more closely integrated within the common foreign and security policy . #% A tiny tax on financial transactions will be able to be put to use to fight poverty in the UK and across the world and mitigate the effects of climate change . #% We are , however , generally very much in favour of this report and look forward to its further progress . #% We spend a lot of time talking about agriculture and structural funds . #% How exactly is the Council going to approach the issue of impact assessments ? #% I suppose Mugabe is increasingly nervous on two counts . #% But then , on the matter of substance , Mr Bourlanges is also wrong because it is in the recollection of everybody who followed it that Mrs Theato withdrew the corrigendum . #% It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle on reform that the Lisbon process has sadly , to date , failed in key areas . #% So all the matters which Mr Telkämper has spoken about have already been dealt with . #% If we can reach agreement , this will allow us to make progress immediately without needing to go all the way to having a fully uniform system straight away . #% Prison rules must be applied scrupulously and the arbitrary treatment of all prisoners must stop . #% Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent . #% From the outset we wanted to ensure that a full budget will be available for the new Member States , and that the commitments will be effectively implemented . #% I would like to say a word finally about the issue of self-regulation . #% We should reject the PPE-DE amendments which seek to classify long-term residents as somehow second-class citizens . #% In particular paragraph ( a ) of Amendment No 1 , which seems to specifically condemn temporary as opposed to permanent contracts , is not appropriate and should not be supported by the House . #% The suffering caused last year by foot and mouth disease was simply unacceptable and it must never be allowed to happen again . #% Informed economic opinion will tell you that lower taxes are the best incentive to economic growth and job creation . #% I think in this case , though , we have a serious case which is going to be a test of will of the Commission , of the policy and certainly of this Parliament too . #% I do not just mean the Commission and the Council , but colleagues from a variety of parliamentary committees . #% We also have to get the Member States to put the resources in and gear up their activities . #% Unusually , everything has run very early tonight . #% Providing meaningful incentives to ensure development of products to tackle some of the most debilitating and upsetting conditions in the world is clearly a job for a new kind of innovative , public/private partnership . #% We believe that the European Arrest Warrant and the European Public Prosecutor unnecessarily impinge upon nation-states ' own legal systems and are therefore undesirable . #% In terms of social and economic criteria this must be done in an open and non-discriminatory way as part of the published tender . #% Deadlines have slipped ; the group should have concluded its work at the end of last year and the new deadline for the spring summit also now seems unrealistic . #% Could you answer that ? #% Mr President , I should like to respond to a few of the points that have been raised in the debate this evening . #% Now I hear some Members of this House who believe that only the state can provide these services and it should be on a monopoly basis . #% This has been a very successful budget line since created last year together with the SAB procedure . #% I also congratulate Mr Miller , who gave a great deal of support to the petitioners on this particular item . #% My own Government in Britain was influential in pushing this forward during its Presidency last year . #% We need to make sure that this is happening . #% Having said that , our priority must always be how we can help the people of Europe . #% 
I urge this House to support the King 's mission in this tricky area . #% Whenever we try it in the United Kingdom , any support from the government tends to mean that the film is going to be a flop . #% There is , after all , no functional necessity to have a larger bureau of each parliamentary committee . #% It is no wonder that the gap between Britain 's richest regions and its poorest regions is still continuing to widen . #% To claim that could undermine our credibility in the future when we may have real cause for concern . #% Everything I have said may imply that there is much to do . #% Furthermore , the participation of Member States in the governing board will make it possible to ensure that once the annual programme is decided by the Commission , all the rest of the decisions related to projects will be taken on the ground without referring back to the management committee composed of Member States in Brussels . #% HACCP is a method of identifying potential hazards and ensuring that proper control strategies are in place , and I welcome that . #% I would like to highlight two challenges to the perfection of the internal market . #% We do not allow them enough freedom of access or the possibility to circulate . #% Lane departure warning systems and electronic stability control are also important . #% Leave it , as the Treaties demand , to the competence of elected governments like mine at Westminster and like that in Ireland . #% Both the Austrian President and Chancellor Schüssel have come to this house calling for the resurrection of a European Constitution which is dead in its own terms . #% One of the issues raised by President Chissano was the concern that ACP countries have about the prospect of enlargement and the impact of it on them in terms of the likelihood that there will be less resources for them . #% You can not make demands of Hamas that you do not make of Israel . #% That is one item that the rapporteur has already dwelt on . #% However , I want to confine my remarks this evening to public service broadcasting in the digital age because there are some very important public access issues that we need to address when defining the principles from the crossover in our current media to the development of digital broadcasting . #% They have respected Parliament and Parliament 's will . #% In all seriousness , the comment from the UK Independence Party should not be disregarded . #% I want to underline two points that were emphasised to me during that time in Geneva . #% That leads to distortion of competition across the EU . #% But for heaven ' s sake Commissioner , by indicating today and presumably also at your press conference , that there is another two weeks , you will make everyone read that as meaning that you have simply extended the deadline . #% The British Conservatives abstained on the Gargani report , since while we greatly appreciated the attempt by the rapporteur to strike the appropriate note of caution when trying to identify the proper application of the Court 's judgment , we do not agree it is even necessary to consider whether or not there is a need to activate the clause . #% However , we are deeply concerned about expenditure in a number of areas that do not reflect value for money or have negative consequences for EU citizens and people in developing countries . #% Mr President , I should like to make three brief points against postponement . #% The Commission has not yet provided sufficient information for useful comment to be made about the contents of self-regulation and co-regulation procedures . #% These have been taken up by a number of Member States but some backbone still needs to be put into these issues . #% Can I say , Commissioner , that I agree with you absolutely : we can not pull out ; we can not create a vacuum , because a vacuum exists there already and that is a vacuum of political will , and we need political leadership to resolve this according to international obligations as well as according to the rule of law . #% I have retabled the amendments excluding LPAI-infected meat from the food chain , because I believe that this must be destroyed at this point . #% On family unification , I would say to Mr Gollnisch that I can well understand , if there were members of his family who were separated from him by thousands of kilometres , that they would not want family reunification - they would be grateful to be parted from him . #% Here in the EU , our Member States have only to consider applying these controls to our citizens operating outside of the European Union . #% The proposed opening of the economies of the ACP countries -- most of which are least-developed countries -- is a major concern . #% If national reserves for a single farm payment , i.e. for additional claims , are to be raised from 1 % to 3 % of the total allocation , where will this come from ? #% The Commission can not simply come to us this afternoon an say it is a sorry tale but it is taking no further action . #% Just a little over five years ago it was said of the Santer Commission that it was difficult to find anyone with the slightest sense of responsibility . #% I am personally proud of the fact that the rapporteur got us through this procedure and it enhances the reputation of Parliament , not merely for its procedures but also for their effectiveness . #% Mr President , I echo the thanks of others to the rapporteur , the Commission and the Council for bringing this forward and recognising the need for further cooperation in this field , a very difficult area . #% I was glad that the President-in-Office mentioned that this morning . #% All that would be a good start , but the change of name should also reflect a change of function . #% Some 80 % of heart attacks , stroke and diabetes , and some 40 % of cancers could be avoided by changing lifestyle and cutting out the risks that come from a bad lifestyle . #% But as other speakers have made clear , the abolition of the urban community initiative would dismantle European support in 110 cities benefiting half a million people across Europe . #% What are you going to do , Council , what are you going to do , Commission , to ensure that those Antonov planes do not continue to fly over the villages of Darfur dropping bombs on those innocent civilians ? #% Mr President , I apologise to the rapporteurs that I was not able to be here at the beginning of the debate , but I would wager a euro that nobody has yet touched on the subject that I will raise on behalf of the Committee on Petitions . #% It is a question of how the European Parliament should be spending its time and be seen to be spending its time . #% Regarding the implementation of this programme , the last thing Mr Bradbourn wants is to unnecessarily hold up the legislative process . #% Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union ten years ago , they have moved some way towards democracy , human rights and good government , although a great deal remains to be done . #% I am also concerned by the extent to which many want to define European foreign policy in terms of its distinctiveness from the United States policies , sometimes even deliberate hostility to the United States positions . #% When Mrs Ahern spoke , she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant . #% There is no compelling justification to treat game differently from other meats , as is the case at present . #% As the Commissioner said , we now move on to working with the African Union , which will now be given the task of working through the policies and implementing them . #% Mr Jarzembowski 's amendments , on behalf of the PPE , appear to support the Community approach rather than the Member State approach but we feel that they will have completely the opposite effect . #% It is about politics . #% But my main concern in asking the question - and I do not feel this has been fully dealt with - is over this matter of exactly what `` essential products '' means . #% In conclusion , I broadly support the proposal and the amendments although I may have some concern about particular aspects . #% Today , we reiterate that , for the former Yugoslavia , there can be no impunity for those indictees who are still being sought . #% In particular I should like to thank Mr Karas and Mr Radwan , Mr Bourlanges , Mr Katiforis , Mr Goebbels , Mrs Cazalet from the committee secretariat and my assistant , Sarah McCarthy , for all the help that they have given me on this very demanding dossier . #% We have of course enquired as to why the Conference of Presidents has not placed these two reports on the plenary agenda already . #% I hope that this House will continue to support these reasonable social innovations and I look forward to further constructive discussions . #% I am pleased , therefore , that the rapporteur has recognised this by extending this transition phase to two years . #% The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding . #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order under Rule 151 on inadmissibility of amendments . #% Parliament is very keen to support you , but we need candour in order to do it . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , I , too , would like to congratulate Ms Berès for taking the initiative on this oral question and resolution . #% This is very sad but it is a situation which we have unfortunately had to live with because , if we had not agreed to the texts which we now have in front of us , we probably would not even have had a recommendation . #% It would be preferable to define types of behaviour that are deemed to be unacceptable and which constitute unfair practices . #% It is equally important that as broad as possible a consultation is actually put in place to enable the different points of view to be heard and to be understood when we deal with competition and investment . #% 
I hope Mr Blair crowns his Presidency by pulling Britain out of the common commercial policy and going in next month himself to speak at the WTO . #% We discussed and debated the Food Safety White Paper and went on to pass legislation on food and feed and on the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority . #% He is a direct witness to his own and others ' torture , not only by the US but by UK secret agents . #% I feel it is one that we should not be stepping into at this moment : it crosses the species barrier and it opens up the possibility of self-inspection in the red-meat sector in the future . #% We are yet to see it , although we have heard it will come in the near future . #% Commissioner , my understanding is that this decision went to the anti-dumping committee where the vote was 7 to 7 with Germany abstaining . #% I trust the Commission will also attach importance to this . #% Here I must say no . #% Mr President , a commitment to sustainability leads us too to support fully Amendment Nos 20 to 30 to the Stevenson report . #% People want more local control over their own lives , but our governments continue to cede powers to regions and to Brussels . #% I welcome these proposals as part of the wider financial services action plan which is so important for the future of the economy of the European Union Member States and could potentially deliver such great benefits to ordinary people across the European Union . #% Every democrat among us should therefore condemn these moves . #% We have now fantastic new tools to be able to do that . #% The Council in its May resolution says it is committed . #% As you are aware , I took part in that demonstration , and I would like to thank all those Members who expressed support for the action that I took when I participated in the largest-ever blockade of the base and was arrested , ironically enough , for committing a breach of the peace . #% I am sure if they join the Union , they will wish to ensure transparency and accountability in all the institutions . #% Perhaps it is quite unrealistic to think that there could be progress before the problems are dramatised with the presence of 25 or so ministers at the table . #% We therefore seek to discuss what purpose the Atlantic Alliance now serves , how the Atlantic Alliance should be structured and what means should be placed at its disposal . #% I deplore the actions of those in this House who voted against certain candidate countries joining the EU because of their assistance in the war effort . #% It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities . #% We have talked about doing it but seemingly not done so yet . #% Let us hope that it is speedily ratified . #% People have been hooked on the idea that ` mild ' and ` low tar ' cigarettes are healthier . #% The Spanish Presidency takes office with a full agenda . #% If that list of exemptions , or something close to it , can be sustained over the next few weeks and months I am confident that this directive can be what we all expect and hope it will be , and be greatly to the benefit of the consumer . #% Mr President , the first thing I want to say is how much I welcome what I hope will be the successful conclusion of this landmark agreement , and I congratulate the rapporteur for her tireless work to get the best possible outcome . #% But it seems to me that it is not yet accepted in practice because one sees the various ministers trying to supplement the dual-majority formula with further qualifying clauses which would permit a specified number of Member States to form a blocking minority . #% That kind of effort has also been undertaken by the European Commission in the face of legalistic objections . #% I am definitely not one of those , but essentially the amendments aim for transparency and to help people like me understand the purpose , scope , cost and implementation of export refunds . #% It is a welcome report on economic and social development in Turkey and was supported in the Committee for Foreign Affairs this week . #% Perhaps he is upset that Mr Barroso has likened him to the Sheriff of Nottingham . #% Mr President , I should like to remind this House that in Agenda 2000 we give a high priority to youth education and training but this priority is not reflected within the budget allocation to the Youth Action Programme . #% David Martin reproached us for not spending more time in the Chamber , but one of the problems is the amount of time we waste getting to this place . #% Again we talk a lot about the environment , but the very programmes that will help protect and preserve it will be cut if the Commissioner has his way . #% It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level and many valued people found themselves with redundant skills overnight . #% On deep-vein thrombosis for example , although for over ten years there have been reports of people getting blood clots after travelling by plane no comprehensive independent research has been carried out . #% As the report says , the Lisbon Treaty includes a legal basis for the European space policy and the possibility for permanent structured cooperation on security and defence . #% The precise responsibility for these attacks is still unclear , but there is strong suspicion of external involvement . #% I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law . #% The main issues that have been raised and which I wish to touch on are , first , how the balance of fees is being struck in a way that is fair to small operators , as Mr Goodwill said , but nevertheless does not allow exploitation and evasion of the rules by some . #% In relation to your comment that you could not necessarily infer the issues in my question , I should like to point out that I was directly quoting the head of a police intelligence service in London , who was commenting on the effects of Turkish heroin in the UK . #% There are several disputable facts within the report and explanatory statement which may lead to a false understanding of H1N1 , its impact on European societies and government response plans . #% There is still a lot of work to be done . #% Member States should be looking at whether their social security systems operate to allow people to go through training and to take up educational possibilities , or whether they in fact constrict them because these people have to be ready for work at any moment . #% The question I would like to ask is : is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India , or is there a more personal interest at stake here ? #% In particular we must ensure that there is effective competition policy in all the applicant countries and that there is proper respect for intellectual property which will underpin inward investment , which is so important for them all . #% These small changes will make it possible for Parliament to do that and thereby place us on an equal footing with the Council in the Conciliation Committee . #% The US Government was instrumental in forcing the British Government to capitulate in the face of that terrorist campaign . #% I believe that the perceptions of our European citizens are accurate . #% But if discharge is postponed , I thank Mrs Rühle for her insistence that the latest figures using the DAC methodology are brought forward by May . #% The new parliament must help Romania , Ukraine , Russia , the USA and the EU get together with the Moldovan Government to solve the Transnistria problem . #% Amendment No 8 calls for an economic and operational impact assessment in relation to the expected loss of revenue and effort displacement resulting from the implementation of the regulation . #% This is something of a distraction . #% In the past few weeks , he has left us breathless with his efforts at diplomacy . #% Mr President , I am glad to be able to follow someone who has so vigorously supported the Labour Government , as Mr Bowis just did . #% Finally , if the African Union is to be included , how will allowances be made for the fact that many members of the African Union are not ACP countries ? #% Even the OECD said yesterday that EU enlargement had been at a very high cost to Britain . #% I believe that the Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations , but light on proof . #% It is important that we finally , after five long years , bring this to a close . #% In this case , new and streamlined does not mean better , and that needs to be rectified as a matter of urgency . #% I welcome the public statement here today by the President-in-Office calling for the camp to close . #% We have only to look at what has happened in Canada to see that if you carry on fishing then there is going to be no fish for anybody . #% I would like to pick up one or two points that have come up in the debate . #% Why would the USA want Mr Assange to be extradited to Sweden ? #% That means publishing all the documents relating to the channel tunnel safety authority . #% Millions of people in Europe have bought vitamins and minerals of their choice . #% 
And the other is here ; the place which actually exists , where I find myself working amongst colleagues and others trying to make this continent a better place for its citizens . #% So that reaction adds weight to our awareness of much that was wrong under the previous regime , for example the lack of protection for the rights of religious minorities and the increasing abuse of the blasphemy law which was introduced after the military take-over in 1958 . #% Rarely , in my experience , has so much research gone into a report for the Committee on Regional Policy . #% This is something that is long overdue and has to find its place , eventually , in the mechanisms and workings of this House . #% One of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's amendments deals with the question of information for the small retailer . #% It crosses national frontiers , so we do need European regulations . #% Ultimately the success or failure of this venture will depend on us being able to satisfy people that our little old mothers living in isolated places are still going to get a universal service . #% I have heard rumours that the Commission may be proposing an extra flexibility instrument for heading 4 . #% If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction , there are many other routes we can take . #% I am aware that Tibet 's proud history is also being rewritten by the same species of bureaucrat . #% An empty gesture , because team spirit can not be manufactured : it arises from the game 's culture of combining various skills , of playing for each other , of covering each other 's mistakes and of the post-match social atmosphere . #% However , it looks as if communication with Turkish Cypriots -- convincing them that Europe is friendly and welcoming -- has paid off . #% The only possible alternative - beyond the physical restraints which were placed upon them , both in transit , when they might well have bitten their way through the avionic cables in order to down the planes , and on land - would be the use of high doses of intramuscular tranquillisers which , although effective , would have carried significant risks to the detainees and would have required medical and nursing personnel to accompany them . #% We call for the immediate restoration of the legal and constitutional order in the country and ask all Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the constitution . #% It is the role of the Roman Catholic Church to lead the faithful , not to be led . #% It seems they are saying that if an organization has charitable status it can not give evidence to this Parliament or to its Members . #% The previous part-session , in July , was the first attended by the UK as Presidency of the Council . #% The clear implication was that he could not speak his mind without fear of arrest or prosecution . #% The movement of skilled and educated people to nearby countries would also create a serious brain-drain that would damage the economies of countries such as Moldova and Ukraine . #% I assure you that it does change with the next speaker . #% I also look forward to more details on the rules of origin , because it is quite difficult to judge at this point whether what is being proposed is anything more than cosmetic . #% I simply hope that Mr Gahrton 's powers of comprehension will advance greatly by the time that he reads the letter because he did not show much evidence in the course of his contribution of having any more than the most rudimentary understanding . #% Parliament needs to do so from its own perspective . #% It is a sad example of a failure of solidarity between generations that an alliance principally composed of Socialists and Greens has voted against even an investigation into extending the system to retired Members . #% With this in mind I welcome the Council decision of 29 November to adopt the return action plan for Afghanistan , the first application of this programme . #% Surely Iran is part of the solution rather than part of the problem - a peaceful society in a violent region . #% However , I have never underestimated the practical and political difficulties created over the 30 post-invasion years in which Turkey has moved 120 000 mainland settlers into the north , when they do not share the common historical heritage of the island and generally do not speak English or Greek , previously the bicommunal languages . #% How would the minister describe the European Union stance overall , when some of our citizens and residents are still under illegal detention , being abused and even tortured and denied either release or a fair trial ? #% In other words , we have used our codecision powers to transform a statement of good intent into a legally binding commitment . #% Perhaps he has some thoughts on gas supplies , management of gas stocks and storage facilities for gas . #% Are they going to provide the networks which will allow people to take advantage of the benefits of information technology in schools and public places ? #% Our actions must help to bring peace , support good governance and human rights , involve local people and overcome poverty . #% Throughout our water systems , our great rivers and even down to the sea we see the effects of these substances being pumped into the environment , on a daily basis . #% However , in connection with Parliament 's view of last year I would urge Mr Duisenberg to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of summary minutes . #% We contend that consumers should be able to exercise as wide a choice as possible and that there is no evidence that products on our market are unsafe . #% I urge Members of the House to support an appeal to the Taliban authorities to release those arrested . #% There is no better gauge of its scale and cruelty than the orphan crisis . #% Madam President , on behalf of the British Labour group of MEPs I would like to stress that we fully support the principle of enlargement and the greater part of the Oostlander-Barón Crespo report . #% Girls are back at school , music and film are allowed again and football is replacing public hangings . #% We really are now moving towards a situation where the terrible mass slaughters of the last foot and mouth epidemic really will be a thing of the past . #% If they were all to aspire to eat a US diet we would need four planets the size of earth to produce the extra 9 billion tonnes of grain required . #% Extending the EU 's so-called ` competence ' into criminal justice would be an unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into British sovereignty . #% If Europe is to match the United States economically , we need to create a single capital market ; otherwise borrowing will also be more expensive here , which in turn inevitably favours the United States . #% Madam President , I rise to draw your attention to a report broadcast by the BBC last week , about child trafficking between European Union countries and West Africa . #% As far as MAGP IV is concerned , I am not surprised that we have had to put this off again until April . #% Bearing that situation in mind , when it comes to the IGC , the Council and Member States will appreciate the good sense of what is being proposed here . #% Therefore I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner and Members to our Amendments Nos 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 which recognise the reality that many motorists do not like the Vienna Convention symbol , the rather boring black letters on a white background , but prefer the European symbol of the white and yellow letters with the gold stars on a blue background in accordance with their particular national registration . #% After all , if it were technically impossible , the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow . #% All this , then , has a detrimental effect upon the mobility of our citizens , and in terms of the economic and financial and social costs for our businesses and a wide variety of other people affected on a day-to-day basis by what is going on . #% As you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular . #% In addition , we wish to ensure that any new counter-terrorist legislation is also used to bear down on those terrorist organisations , such as the IRA in all its forms , and ETA , that have been conducting terrorist campaigns from and within EU Member States over the past several decades . #% We would also have liked to see the report cogently address the issues raised by the European Court of Auditors related to such funding , which it singularly fails to do . #% This is a position that we have consistently taken , and we will continue to do so until we see greater urgency applied to the achievement of a positive statement of assurance by the Court of Auditors . #% When is all this going to end ? #% I want to make that position absolutely clear . #% This principle of quotas , we believe , is demeaning to women . #% I also hope that China and Russia will not veto any requests in the UN Security Council for further resolutions on this matter , should America so request . #% I also agree that it is essential for countries which are largely dependent upon nuclear power plants for their electricity and energy that closure programmes are phased to allow time to provide replacement capacity . #% Democracy is about following the democratic wishes of the people and ensuring individuals have the power to choose the direction in which they would like their local council , Parliament or Europe to go . #% Secondly , by way of example , perhaps he could comment on whether he would be willing to contemplate schemes to help intensive pig or poultry producers to switch from current intensive methods to extensive methods in the future . #% Members of Parliament may have heard that a number of aid workers have been arrested by the Taliban authorities , largely on the basis that this is a Christian-based organisation which contravened the Taliban 's rules on religious intolerance . #% The problem of organised crime has been mentioned -- people trafficking and drug trafficking are still serious issues . #% It is not an area that should be subject to general competition policy and we have tabled amendments to that effect . #% Would you like it to be elected ? #% For its part , the African Union has said that an Africa-dominated UN force in Darfur is absolutely necessary . #% Situation at the border between FRY/Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia #% 
Could the Commissioner tell the House how many people are involved in this work ? #% I have rather more doubts with regard to the situation in the United Kingdom , about one or two of the other amendments , particularly those which allow a consumer to suspend instalment payments unilaterally in any circumstances , which may result in difficulties in some cases . #% I just wish to say to colleagues who may not like the result : we have been over this ground before , practically every year when the same subject has arisen . #% Given that the Spring summit is supposed to be about sustainability , I am also interested to know what proposals there will be from Council about how it is going to change its own structures to deal with this much more integrated approach . #% It is true that the Lisbon Summit also represented something of a sea-change in attitudes towards the global society and in particular towards issues like e-commerce . #% As the British know , the United States is the UK 's biggest trading and investment partner and has been for some years . #% I am delighted to see that he has finally arrived here so that he can hear me say that yet again . #% I want to pick up on a point made by Bill Miller . #% However , Europe should meet the aspirations of its people in partnership with the United States . #% Again , those are measures for individual governments and their own air carriers . #% We deeply sympathize with the people of Iraq . #% I am pleased that they have been , in the most part , respected . #% We have to concentrate on reducing waste , recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort . #% in writing . - British Conservatives have been unable to approve discharge of the 2007 European budget , European Council section . #% There is something fundamentally wrong with this and it needs to be addressed with real determination . #% I believe that this is quite unacceptable and an affront to democracy . #% On the other hand , there are the fears and the pessimisms of the anti-Europeans , who seem to think that we have already built not just a federal system , but a centralised superstate with everything being decided not just in this Parliament , but by the Commission . #% We do not understand ! '' #% For part-time workers the pay gap is enormous and has remained unchanged since the mid-1970s , with women earning only 58 % of men 's average hourly pay . #% It is important , this evening , that we dwell on the very positive aspects of this particular proposal . #% We owe it to ourselves and to those people in those jobs . #% The rapporteur , the shadow rapporteur and the chairman of the committee would all support a suggestion that this be turned into a vote without debate . #% This will cost money : the device in the car will cost anything from EUR 150 to EUR 450 , but , if done properly , the price will come down . #% Let us remind ourselves that the knowledge economy will be driven by private investment . #% It should be used in other reports in other areas , and we should learn from that . #% However , I have been reassured at least by the United States authorities and by the multi-layered data protection systems and judicial safeguards that are in place through this interim agreement . #% For each one of them there are justifications that sound credible . #% I would just add that my good friend Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , who , jointly with Mrs Ayuso González , tabled Amendment 12 , to which Mrs Ferreira referred , asked me to point out that she thinks there is a translation problem - at least in the English version - and that the category ` fine bakery products , energy-reduced or with no added sugar ' - is supposed to be an addition to the previous text and not a replacement for it . #% This would send a very clear message to the industry that you can not abuse the system . #% Are there lessons to be learned ? #% With a positive approach , however , the EU can make a real contribution to the lives of ordinary people in the North-West . #% We should not underestimate just how steep , stony and difficult the path is going to be , but I do hope , for all our sakes , and for the world , that we can set off on the right foot and in the right direction . #% But what if they are not ? #% Our work on the risks of whole body vibration was evidently to stop farmers from driving tractors after only three or four hours , even at the height of the harvest . #% In the Sudan Sharia has even been used against Christians , which is contrary to Islamic teaching . #% The first point is : will he guarantee that not one penny of this subsidy will be given as an employment subsidy in any of the three countries mentioned ? #% There need to be well publicised penalties , as my colleague has said , for people who are involved in sex tourism because so many people , especially children , are drawn into prostitution and drugs . #% This report as it stands was passed with unanimity in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy with no abstentions . #% AIDS is a global problem . #% Neither they nor their lawyer were present when evidence was originally presented to the investigating judge who took his arbitrary decisions in camera . #% It must be a ` development round ' , in which developing countries , effectively excluded from previous rounds , are fully included . #% I was amazed to hear senior American politicians talk blithely about Turkey joining the European Union , as if it was a very simple matter . #% We understand that one of the annexes -- both of which include around fifty legislative proposals -- is supposed to relate to the priorities , while the other is not . #% I call , therefore , on Pakistan to ratify the SAARC and all UN conventions on terrorism and I congratulate India on its restraint in the face of provocation and on its joint declaration with the EU in November last year against terrorism . #% The appointment of Baroness Ashton , in particular , as a currently serving Commissioner must have been a source of particular happiness for President Barroso , though this must not afford an opportunity for the Commission to assume greater power in its hands rather than in the hands of the democratic institutions of Europe . #% We would like to have a dialogue with you over the next couple of weeks to ensure that the broad economic guidelines for the future are what we actually require in this new European environment . #% In other words there seems to be no real choice about what the European Commission is proposing this year , and no choice about what the strategic priorities of the European Union should be . #% I , however , will regard the departure of President Castro as a fresh chance to build a prosperous and democratic Cuba . #% The United Nations Development Programme itself states that it is an ` impartial and trusted partner with the Zimbabwean Government ' . #% The Commission proposal recognises the need to ensure legal recognition of electronic signatures which have the same validity as handwritten signatures . #% I wanted us to have a right of appeal or for the European Court of Justice to have jurisdiction . #% Is it correct that a child has already died -- admittedly in the Far East -- from eating infected meat ? #% I would point out to Mrs Cresson that there are some 10 million known diabetics in the European Union but we believe there are 10 million others whose symptoms are not recognized . #% We know there are differences of views between NGOs and between scientists , but this motion for a resolution , I believe , is a balanced one . #% Mr President , I have admiration for the accomplishment of scientific research in developing medicines which have proved of great benefit . #% Mr President , may I ask the President-in-Office a question of a different sort on air traffic control . #% However , in the time available I want to concentrate on just one issue . #% We welcome his initiative to call for greater access to public documentation of European Union organizations . #% Local authorities have tried to put forward proposals to reinvigorate the area using KONVER funds to generate more employment , but they have run into difficulties with the existing programme rules . #% We must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk . #% The EU welcomes these announcements and hopes that both undertakings will be put into practice . #% This debate should involve national parliaments and the European Parliament as well as the Member States in Council and the Commission . #% That is what the network is : everyone working for the one central authority - the Commission . #% Mr President , like Mr Harbour I would like to thank the Commission for such a positive input into the world summit , and also Mr Harbour himself for pursuing this issue so doggedly . #% In that amendment we are seeking a letter of amendment from the Commission to supplementary and amending budget No 1 of 1998 so that we can continue with the policy of property acquisition . #% Secondly , we accept that when we try to deal with small - and medium-sized enterprises in the traditional sector we always say it is very difficult to contact them . #% 
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance . #% Finally , I welcome both these reports but I urge that ... #% Of course it is a compromise , but it is an important compromise for two reasons : equal pay for equal work -- and that means equal ; fair treatment for all our colleagues . #% The final point of the report I should like to emphasise concerns atypical workers . #% That means that I often find myself caught between the two of them , but the work they have done is excellent and what Ms Wallis has spoken about today proves that point . #% I hope that we can all grow up quickly and bring a little more dignity and integrity to our role as co-legislator . #% Perhaps fairly soon in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we will take the opportunity of asking the Commission what will be the consequences in these various respects if we do not meet this self-imposed deadline . #% The Internet for both recreational study or for business use is catching on fast in our part of the world . #% Since ( ... ) the outbreak of the Lebanon war , the Israeli Defence Forces have been rampaging through Gaza -- there 's no other word to describe it -- killing and demolishing , bombing and shelling , indiscriminately . #% At a meeting in Tashkent on 17 October he said : ' I believe that people are born with an instinct for liberty and that freedom and democracy come naturally to people everywhere once they are given the chance ' . #% I have to thank my fellow rapporteurs . #% Mr President , this is the fourth resolution that I have tabled on Burma in the last 18 months , but the situation continues to deteriorate and the Council 's reaction is pusillanimous . #% I am absolutely certain that , had those people pictured in our media been cruise-line passengers , they would have been picked up far more quickly than was the case . #% Despite what has been said this morning , little is known about the action that the EU has taken , and amongst those who do know about it the majority believe that it is insufficient . #% Public confidence in the legal aspects of road safety across the European Union must increase so that our citizens can travel freely from country to country without fear of huge legal fees and 15 intimidating legal systems . #% In fact , what we need is not deregulation but correct and efficient regulation . #% Are all unanimous scientific committee opinions delivered to him in future to be negotiable ? #% Mr President , it has been a great privilege to serve in a Parliament that has made such great progress in delivering for Europe the constitutional settlement that it needs . #% Let us think about a positive way forward . #% The vague criterion and inadequate procedures contained in this instrument have not helped me to penetrate the logic behind some EU decisions , nor does it help the EU to defend itself against accusations of ambivalence and discrimination in the face of serious human rights violations . #% There is a determined government , keen to act on its promises . #% I recognise there will be a further negotiation on this point before the directive is finally agreed , and that it was vital for this Parliament finally to agree a text to enable the process to move forward . #% They are going to be reimbursed if they change their minds and they have the right to full reimbursement if the supplier goes bankrupt or fails to perform the service involved . #% We accept that it is a complicated and complex matter in terms of industrial planning when you get transfers , restructuring and plant closures taking place . #% It would be a pity if the best appeared to be the enemy of the good and everybody just voted for his own amendment and , at the end of the day , we did not manage to get the right amendment . #% Then we faced a hostile Soviet Union that held Central and Eastern Europe in its iron grip . #% If this enriches us all , as I think it will , individual Member States might then be in a position to help their neighbours financially ; but charity should begin at home . #% The House will be aware that because the Commission has a privileged position in bringing infringement proceedings it therefore has a unique ability to safeguard the interests of complainants . #% Mr President , I thank Mrs Hieronymi for the work she has put into this report . #% Madam President , following on from the last comment , it is obvious that the Irish made their decision in a very democratic way , as did , alas , the British people , because they voted in this wonderful Labour government . #% Madam President , Mr President-elect , I represent the EDD Group , a small group in this Parliament , but extremely democratic . #% No other issue has taken Parliament so long to deal with as that of animal testing in the matter of cosmetic products . #% Since the Communist forces of the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) invaded 61 years ago , Tibetans have faced a systematic suppression of their unique way of life . #% It could be argued that we have actually given the Council more than we really should have done . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , it is rather difficult for me to know where to begin on this . #% A huge banner was being raised - it does not matter to what end . #% I believe we are moving towards welfare systems which are based much more on a clear relationship between the contributions and the insurance principle and the eventual payment to citizens . #% As Mr Schmid said , he had at the beginning a very difficult brief . #% I think that this European Parliament should be proud that every point of view has been heard and every point of view considered . #% For example , in the UK , the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act does not even give all disabled people a basic right to nondiscrimination in employment , transport or education . #% It is also vital that Parliament adopts the amendment to ensure that Member States can allow a reduced rate for repairs to listed buildings . #% I hope that this Parliament will push the Commission to be sympathetic when the British Government requests it in due course . #% Indeed , security was the raison d'être for what has become the European Union today . #% What can we do throughout all the Member States to have an effective control on these imports and , indeed , their ban ? #% Would the Commissioner comment on whether the European Commission has been successful in identifying developing countries to utilise these monies in this way and what further steps he plans to take in order to achieve this ? #% It seems to me that if Commissioners are to be appointed at the end of this year on the same basis as they are at the moment , it would present serious problems . #% It is a question of what Parliament should be looking at as its priorities . #% Mr Poos calls on Cypriots to leave nationalism at the door . #% No stone should left unturned to achieve this objective . #% This approach should not result in a lowering of the level of consumer protection achieved under national arrangements . #% Congress goaded us last week , Mr Spring , and said that all it expected from Europe was a strongly worded letter from President Santer . #% Secondly , in respect to the environmental data , the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information . #% It is absolutely right that these economic units should still maintain their relationship at this European level ; in terms of representativeness , at least , the key organizations involved within the workplace have been involved in a long-term role and in consolidating the social dialogue that exists . #% My report ensures that carriers ' liability extends to all transport to the EU of third-country nationals who are undocumented . #% Mr President , I and my delegation of British Conservatives welcome the rejection of the Commission 's proposal in the previous vote in Parliament , and we regret the current proposal to accept the Commission 's proposal , which is flawed . #% He should be released now , and I ask the Commission to intervene in this case . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Ecofin Council , be prepared to meet with a delegation of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee perhaps early in September to see if , during the early weeks of the autumn , we can thrash out a new relationship which will strengthen the relationship between Parliament and the Council during the crucial period running up to the conclusion of economic and monetary union ? #% Mr President , the Council 's answers to our questions this afternoon have been clear , albeit not as full as many of us would have liked . #% We are losing the battle but we must not give up the fight . #% More importantly , perhaps , this is a right that goes to the centre of the European Union . #% At that time , we would have to express Parliament 's view , as we say now , that insufficient progress has been made on land seizures , on political violence , on all of these things that others have raised . #% I have a horrible feeling that the whole ship is sinking . #% When you hear the President of the United States say during the State of the Union Address that the American economy can no longer be an oil-based mineral economy , then it shows that things are changing , and here in Europe we have great possibilities . #% Examples of this include the Working Time Directive and the large numbers of rules introduced to uphold various rights , each of which has the major effects of crushing enterprise and enriching lawyers . #% It is a shame that these compromises go so far from the text adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , after some heroic efforts by Mr Harbour , the shadow rapporteur . #% It is still work in progress , so now there is an opportunity for you to participate and I welcome the fact that you say you are going to take that opportunity . #% 
The definitions of what amounts are involved and how serious these issues are will be very difficult and will doubtless be debated in the future . #% I believe that the potential benefits of energy-saving , of making more efficient products and of reducing carbon dioxide emissions speak for themselves . #% We should recognise that Bulgaria and Romania are being subjected to an unparalleled degree of scrutiny . #% A new style of governance is needed for this fragile area of our globe in which every citizen of the world feels they have an interest or a stake . #% However , there were four empty chairs at that crucial advisory meeting , the first meeting that will set a two-year agenda . #% Today , its recent former foreign minister is Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council . #% As a former Member of Parliament in the West Country , he will know that industry extremely well . #% That is why I support a mixture of technological solutions to energy supply in the EU . #% However , in saying that , they are reading it alongside paragraph 14 , which says that Member States that continue to use such measures should take all steps to ensure that they do not continue beyond 2009 . #% I just wondered whether you agree with me that his continued support for Britain to join the euro , his surrender of GBP 2 billion a year of the British rebate and his whole approach towards Britain 's membership of the European Union - his refusal to give the British a referendum - all show that he has sufficient pro-European credentials to become the President ? #% Womens ' freedom will only be guaranteed if there is a proper programme of education extending to both sexes and vigorously pursued . #% Temporary agency working would become an ever-growing bottom tier in a two-tier labour force . #% I also agree that the important first step must be to work closely with the various agencies and the pharmaceutical industry in order to monitor and assess the problem . #% I would ask the Liberals , in the spirit of cooperation , to withdraw their highly destructive resolution . #% I hope the Commission can give us an explanation before it releases any aid and that it can also give us assurances on this matter . #% We gather that the omens are not good and that Japan probably , and Canada certainly , lack the political will to go ahead without the United States . #% We all know the threat from terrorism over the last few years has increased considerably . #% Recent reports by the European Court of Auditors and OLAF have revealed substantial holes in the Commission 's accounts . #% The EU must see in its partnership with the developing countries the opportunity to influence public policy to save children 's lives . #% That will require the Council , the Commission and Parliament to do two things at the crucial next stage , when the three newly identified strands of information , rapid response , promotion and prevention are translated into new horizontal action programmes . #% We rely on common standards upheld by consistent levels of inspection , assessment and enforcement . #% But what happens in the meantime ? #% They are saying , and rightly so I suspect , that the value of their property will be considerably diminished . #% You are on your own . #% The EMU idiosyncratically scarcely mentions the shaky state of consumer and business confidence as a significant contributing factor in the current and recent economic slowdown . #% This document has no legal force whatsoever . #% I have , then , virtually answered the first question as to whether we are absolutely committed to reoccupying the renovated building . #% It is a shameful move on the part of the British Government and I hope it will be soundly defeated . #% The report and the minority opinion expressed agree that some illegal detentions and transportations may have taken place . #% This shocking situation , which contrasts with what will be the case when the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes binding - under which foreigners as well as EU citizens will have their basic rights guaranteed - comes hot on the heels of other miscarriages of justice such as the case of a Briton who was executed when a Texas judge refused to look at DNA evidence and another Briton held for three weeks in prison in South Africa because of FBI incompetence . #% My conclusion today is that the Commission is there to propose . #% This , of course , is the position with this report . #% This new proposal has a clause which would oblige a Member State to take responsibility where it had knowingly tolerated people illegally on its territory for at least two months . #% I made my own submission and I have read many of the others and I think that what you have just given us is a very fair summary . #% It may appear a very technical report but it covers some important issues and was unanimously agreed by the committee . #% The revised text of recital 4 makes a particular reference to the taxation issue . #% We are , unfortunately , as has been mentioned , seeing some very serious things going on : abuse , money laundering , corruption , exploitation of underage players ; things which are serious crimes against which we really must take the action which we have been planning for so long . #% We insist on responsibility and accountability . #% Mr President , every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank 's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes . #% I would appreciate some clarification . #% I understand that the Fisheries Council will be meeting tomorrow and that our opinion on the Papayannakis resolution will go to the Fisheries Council . #% Between 1978 and 2000 was the British Government correctly applying EU Insurance Directive 73/239/EEC ? #% Now , for some years , recreational sea anglers have been lobbying for their sport to be included as part of the CFP . #% Britain now has a government put in place by only 21 % of the electorate . #% I regret that MEPs are only going to have a restricted debate on it , but I am confident that , whatever our opinions on the publication of the cartoons , it will condemn unreservedly the violence and destruction committed because of the offence taken . #% The proposal to take EUR 2 million per year away from South Africa for six years may not seem much . #% There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning . #% Especially in these times of economic stringency , we want a tougher attitude towards spending in general : not more spending , but better spending . #% Mr President , I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade . #% Parliament has a need and a right to know the answers to these precise questions . #% The second theme or trend is that the talks extended well beyond traditional market access preoccupations and moved towards the development of new rules , competition , investment and , above all , the environment . #% Members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course . #% If the Council is to meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity , we need a definition of a ` legislative capacity ' . #% We are about to engage in a historic process which in my opinion will either make or break the European Union . #% Secondly , on Amendments Nos 23 and 24 , this allows the funds of an insurance company arising from outside the group to be taken into account in the holding company test . #% I have no doubt this move is directly related to the President of the Commission 's call for the development of a ` Europe of the regions ' . #% Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen , who has worked so hard and with his customary thoroughness to get us to the stage of this compromise . #% Finally , Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world . #% Finally , before responding to the two amendments tabled by Mr Ferber , I must say that I heard Mr Miller 's comments on Mr Ferber 's amendments and think that , whatever glorious future offers itself to my good friend Mr Miller , I can safely predict that he will not be made head of the diplomatic service . #% If it is needed , we need to have a proper cost-benefit analysis of businesses , including small businesses , and the workforce alike . #% In other words - no , but it was a very nicely wrapped-up reply . #% Can I please ask the Presidency to take note of this ? #% For those reasons I reject those voices I have heard in recent weeks that suggest that the European Union has no role to play , or ought not to interfere , in the Middle East peace process . #% Other speakers here have commented on how this whole world of telecommunications and broadcasting and transfer of data has changed in a relatively short time . #% Indeed , the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs have worked well together to come up with a package that is worthy of the support of this House . #% author . - Mr President , I rise on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to introduce this oral question which has been prompted by recent accidents in Italy and the Netherlands , both of which , sadly , had fatalities . #% 
However , it might also make some marginal improvements to what is now a fundamentally good piece of legislation , which has set a new balance in the relationship between producers and consumers . #% We never seem to learn the lessons of history . #% Here we are , on the verge of the second Greek bail-out , and you say , ` there is no alternative ' . #% I have to say , however , that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target , not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives . #% This action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the European Union . #% It will bring about substantial improvements in the emissions from very large combustion plants , usually burning coal or oil , which make such a substantial contribution to the amounts of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides that go into the air , which cause acid rain and which have health effects upon human beings , such as asthma . #% Thirdly , I would ask for the democratic deficit in this process to be repaired , certainly at the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% We will be welcoming Commissioner Hübner to the region later this year to see some of the impressive projects that have been financed . #% I now turn to Romania , a country whose people have long been close to my mind and to my heart . #% I also hope that the UK government will correctly fund the local authorities which are charged with the task of collecting these batteries . #% I have particular concerns about the taking of herring for industrial purposes . #% Also , the original Northern Dimension had a wide vision of a policy from the Urals to Greenland , encompassing the Arctic and the subarctic region . #% It was also confusing yesterday to hear that Mr Issing , the ECB ' s chief economist , reportedly stated in London that the Bank would not publish economic forecasts for Euro-land , perpetuating a culture of secrecy . #% What was the balance of opinion on that occasion ? #% I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on his firmness in the face of what , frankly , has been a very unscrupulous and dishonest lobbying of this Parliament . #% We have joined a chorus of voices from the Spanish parliament , the US Senate and the House of Representatives that are demanding change . #% The other point I want to make is the contrast between Mr Wiebenga 's report and the previous one by Mr Kirkhope . #% Let us do it with wholehearted political conviction , not just as a diplomatic exercise . #% I would like Commissioner Byrne to explain in more detail how we are going to enforce the same kind of controls on feed imported into the European Union . #% Frankly , even if this aim could be achieved by the Commission 's financial instrument - and I share Mr Bradbourn 's scepticism on this - the amount of money allocated would hardly begin to dent the problem . #% In order to perpetuate this myth , we invent periodic scares to frighten people into submission . #% I do not know where you get your advice from , but statistically , the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years , so what are you going to shovel all this money into ? #% That is the sort of concern that is being expressed in this Parliament . #% I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to talk to the Council , talk to the Commission , and say why this is not yet being enforced . #% The debate is engendering further hostility to trade with Israel and undermines Israel 's faith in the impartiality of the EU as a vital component of the quartet in the quest for the Roadmap for Peace and the end of terrorism . #% The tasks we want a monitoring centre to undertake can be handled at the Dublin Foundation and/or the Seville Joint Research Centre at little extra cost . #% It is important and I am glad you have announced that the President will take this up . #% The present situation is a flawed and inequitable market . #% Poverty alleviation , health-care and educational reform are vital and can not be achieved by neo-liberal solutions imposed from outside . #% That of course means the committees which are involved in codecision reacting rather swiftly to make sure that we have that information so that we can make sure that this budget is complete . #% We would therefore be facilitating the regeneration of declining peripheral areas if we supported the measures outlined by the rapporteur . #% We do not need this type of so-called ` dominance ' from the Council . #% We want to be able to see these codes of conduct effectively applied so as to make sure not only that the people at the top accept political responsibility , but also that we have high quality management right the way down so that people can be appointed for what they know rather than who they know . #% These directives do not address properly the very real risk of contamination of non-GM and organic agriculture with GM varieties . #% We have been hearing this afternoon about a time of recession increasing risks of exclusion unless we are very careful : the risks of people now losing their jobs and maybe not making it back to the labour market at some point in the near future ; those who are already in difficulty not even being able to access the labour market ; and then of course there are those who are not even part of the labour market . #% I happily did so , except on one issue , in a sense on behalf of the Commission , which had understandably expressed concern about the provisions of recital 5 , and which suggested that this regulation would be subservient to existing bilateral agreements . #% The EU sanctions , decided on 15 October , target the leaders of the regime , their backers and those who benefit from their policies , including trade sanctions in those sectors - timber , minerals , metals , gems - from which the regime draws most of its revenue . #% Initial responses to Mr Fischler 's proposals on CAP reform , limited as they are , and current reports from Johannesburg suggest that Mr Byrne 's words about the phasing-out of agricultural export subsidies may well be an empty promise . #% There are a number of practical issues that Ms Wallis touched on , as indeed did Sir Robert Atkins . #% I want to know whether the Commission is preparing a specific action plan for this meeting , because just turning up simply will not be enough . #% It is extremely rare that an instance occurs when I can say that I am in complete agreement with a member of the UK Labour Party . #% If we turn Turkey away , I believe that will be an action that we will live to regret . #% I congratulate the 141 States which have ratified or acceded to this Treaty and call upon the four EU Member States remaining after enlargement on 1 May which have not yet done so -- namely , Estonia , Latvia , Finland and Poland -- to do so without any further delay . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , may I congratulate you on your presidency and in particular welcome the fact that in your remarks you have referred to history - and others have referred to it as well . #% It is talk , discussion , debate , right of assembly that would be affected by the proposed Lithuanian laws . #% The decisions made by this Parliament on the transportation of animals have been repeatedly ignored and horrendous suffering continues . #% To support and encourage such opportunities requires considerable preparation by all the partners involved and the proposals that the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment have resubmitted provide the key elements for such preparation . #% The Commission can not go on expanding indefinitely . #% But let me make it clear for the record that this was a bloodless coup ; political parties were not banned and no restrictions were placed on the media . #% As Commissioner Kovács quite rightly said , where there are problems , vehicles have not been confiscated . #% Proportionality , protection and redress are the key to reforming this tool . #% I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament has put forward has helped to strengthen the methodology , also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle . #% But in a minefield the early warning is given by the first person to step on the mine and that was the UK . #% The Budget Committee of Alicante is spending ECU 24 million on a new building about which the Commission knew very little and about which Parliament was not even informed . #% He introduced democracy to that country in 1964 : free elections , a free media , universities , hospitals ; he introduced women into politics . #% I do not think she is arrogant ; I think she is noble when she upholds the EU 's unswerving commitment to ending the death penalty . #% author . - Mr President , Uganda is a deeply Christian country where traditional values hold sway . #% Regardless of the proposed competences of the agency , I would like to make it quite clear that the Commission will continue to exercise its powers and fully assume its responsibilities . #% But I must mention the debate that now seems to dominate Europe 's agenda : the appointments of the President of the European Council and the High Representative . #% Why is it that six months after the regulation entered into force , no information campaign has been launched by the institutions ? #% We fear that route leads to higher costs to consumers or an incentive to use unregulated foreign suppliers . #% Hence it is totally incorrect to state that the problem with Question Time to the Commission stemmed from our not having sufficient time because we no longer sit on Fridays . #% It is regrettable that given the importance of the summit there is not some representation from the European Parliament . #% As Mrs García-Orcoyen has pointed out , this has already happened , for example , with breast implants , where alternatives to silicon have proved to be more dangerous than the implants they replaced . #% I was attracted at first by the outrage of colleagues who said that this proposal represented the state turning lawyers and others into policemen on their behalf - but as I read and researched , my views changed . #% It therefore deserves to be adopted by the IGC . #% 
I would hope that , if we have temporary committees in future , they will deal with subjects outside the normal committee structure . #% And what did we do ? #% I visited Aceh and the city of Banda Aceh six months ago . #% I use that phrase because you , Mr President , used the phrase ` work patterns ' rather than ' a shorter working week ' . #% The freer and the quicker that information can move about the community , the quicker the improvement to the economy can be . #% Finally , my special thanks go to the rapporteur for the inclusive manner in which she has handled a very difficult dossier and my personal good wishes to her for the outcome of the vote tomorrow . #% The matter is delayed for that reason . #% It is a clear snub to the people of Galicia . #% The EU should maximise the advantages of well-trained workers who are motivated , skilled and experienced . #% I have in mind the general principle that we should reinforce the independence of the Agency so as to make it both more effective and more credible by increasing the ways in which the Agency is accountable , in particular to this Parliament . #% I speak from our experience on the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy . #% Unfortunately , however , there have been serious setbacks to its implementation and the recent strike by 20 farmers in Manilla over the return of land to a large landowner illustrates this . #% Strict controls on plants to prevent the transfer of genes from GMOs to other species are crucial . #% They are there for the time in which the market is still being directly regulated , but this whole package envisages a time when the entire market will operate under normal competition aspects . #% Mr Titford could , at any time , have suggested amendments to me . #% At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place . #% In reply to Mr Fitzsimons , the Commission is aware of the voluntary withdrawal by toys distributors in several Member States of these particular items . #% Oh no , that is done for us by the overpaid , unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and today we have a former Communist Commissar lecturing us on what we can and can not do ! #% We can gain real benefits from GMOs if we get it right . #% Fast-growing willows and poplars can be used , as I saw some years ago in Austria , to provide small-scale heat and electricity supply in remote , isolated areas . #% It is also vitally important to support young people who are no longer in mainstream education by encouraging non-formal and informal education . #% Moreover , if we removed these subsidies , we would also remove a health threat . #% We must also recognise and fight against the discrimination experienced by indigenous and peasant women . #% It is pretty clear that none of you have learned anything . #% Mr President , I will not bash America because the whole set of international trading regulations on medicines is in a mess . #% It is a characteristic of terrorist campaigns that their victims are , for the most part , ordinary civilians who want nothing more than to have a fair chance of bringing up their children in an atmosphere of peace , stability , freedom and increasing prosperity . #% For these reasons , we have decided to abstain on this report . #% These crops produce sterile seeds so farmers will be unable to save seeds from one year 's crops to sow the next , forcing them into buying seeds each year from biotech corporations whose control over seeds is already enormous : just ten corporations control more than 50 % of global seed sales . #% Madam President , I refer to the draft regulation on European political parties . #% Such people need to have a modern working environment and progressive career prospects in order to enable them to do a good job even better , with more explicit recognition of their capabilities . #% Legislation should only be brought forward when we demonstrate that there is a clear need for it , rather than best practice or the exchange of best practice . #% I have been told of recent cases of non-British vessels sailing under the British flag , which were prosecuted in a British court , found guilty and fined , simply sailing away to another Member State leaving the fines unpaid . #% Also , given that there is such overwhelming , massive support in the United Kingdom , as shown by the surveys , including a television survey which recorded 94 % of people in favour of their return , would the Council like to give an opinion as to whether this would be a practical and good thing to do , since it comments on matters all over the world on which it has not the slightest influence ? #% Furthermore , the way these measures are being proposed by a preparatory committee meeting in secret gives us no confidence for the future . #% Similarly , the European Community must be prepared to spend not a single penny on reconstruction until we are sure we have an agreement . #% The people of your countries would be far better off enjoying the rights and freedoms of the British . #% For instance , a balance must be struck between a state 's right to defend itself against terrorist action and the need to ensure civil rights for prisoners . #% So shout to him and say : ` This will take my truck off the road ! ' or , in short , ` Truck off ! ' . #% That will allow this Parliament , through all its various committees , to take a serious look at the political content of regulation and not ever again become immersed for five years in this sort of complex , technical regulation - a process that we finally sign off this evening . #% I did that with some regret , but the consequence of the amendment passing would have been to delete the reference to the Assyrian community , amongst others . #% There should be a resolution , especially since we are supposed to be scrutinising the work of the Commission . #% Never before has the social dialogue been quite so important , at least in terms of its maintenance , and we can see that in many ways it is under threat from people who would , I think , prefer industrial anarchy . #% I will start by briefly stating what I think corporate governance will not do . #% The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects . #% The last time we were in a budget debate , I think , I saw the Council benches absolutely empty . #% In Lubumbashi , where I was based , they worked non-stop throughout the night , without electricity , fuel or water ; a 22-hour count conducted in large part by candlelight and where the officials slept for a few minutes by rota in their determination to enable the process to be completed fairly and accurately . #% However , this is a compassionate report , one with which we can be satisfied but not complacent . #% America , alas , paid the price on 11 September . #% We all wish the United Nations investigator , Mr Detlev Mehlis , every success in bringing those guilty to justice . #% Despite the action that the Council has taken in the past , I would like to know what further action the Council proposes to take over the next few weeks to deal with the hostage situation which has now dragged on for some considerable time , causing a great deal of suffering to the families involved , and also what political action it will take to bring about a solution to the situation in Kashmir , which should be based on the principle of self-determination . #% Landfills are reaching capacity , incinerators are overflowing and the wads of excessive packaging we use should go . #% This Commission communication and Barbara Weiler 's excellent report address the need to modernize and improve social protection in Europe to meet these challenges and to provide a social model which respects human dignity . #% We also need to ensure that our European industries are not disadvantaged , so we must go as far as we can to ensure that substances in articles imported to Europe are covered by the same rules as those produced here , without infringing WTO rules . #% Ozone is a collective problem which has to be dealt with collectively . #% As peace becomes more possible , the more the criminals -- the drug runners , the bullies , the extortionists -- feel threatened . #% And yes , I will be donning a red plastic nose in common with everyone else . #% This does not seem to have transmitted itself to this particular committee , which recommends upgrading EU-India relations by outsourcing and insourcing . #% These carriers must do more - they must properly check all vehicles and all modes of transport to try to avoid another Dover-type tragedy . #% However , I feel that there is a touch of opportunism in the PPE Group ' s objections to a vote this week . #% That principle only holds good if the decisions are scientifically irreproachable . #% I hope the UK will emphasise human rights violations in brutal regimes such as Burma and Zimbabwe . #% I spoke about that in this House last month , but many of the crime bosses are still at large and there is concern about how far their tentacles spread . #% I do not underestimate the importance of the exchange of best practice on national integration policies and I pay tribute to the measures put in place in Denmark under his stewardship . #% Who knows when it might be appropriate to do that again in the history of European integration . #% It sticks . #% There are certain areas , such as literacy and numeracy , where we can now gain some idea of what has been achieved . #% 
Whilst the EU has been active in protecting children from harmful media influences , such as the 1999 action plan and the Council recommendation , it is high time that a more concrete action plan was developed which involves not only policy-makers , but also NGOs , consumer groups and voluntary associations . #% Mr President , in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands . #% Some simple questions : how long is the Commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act ? #% Similarly , we also welcome the call , in the Borghezio report , to look at the question of those charities which are little more than front organisations for fund-raising for terrorism . #% Will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in February , to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the Council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list . #% Obviously some of the things they will air are their differences about the Kyoto Protocol on the environment and global warming and about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , which needs updating . #% Despite some of the criticisms of the Commission , at the level of the Committee on Petitions we generally work very well together . #% As many will know , I have always been a strong supporter of closer transatlantic relations . #% Earlier this afternoon there were some bigoted contributions from the other side of the Chamber about the dominance of Christianity in Europe and how important that was . #% Things are going along much more smoothly than they were , despite the fact that we are considerably squeezed for money because of external demands upon our budget . #% That is why it is worth fighting for more through this Parliament and also worth including consumer or patient expertise in the committees assessing the programme development . #% Finally , the EMI report failed to point a finger of blame at the rigid monetary policies pursued by some national monetary authorities whose effect in the real economy has been so deleterious . #% We need to take action on the implementation of legislation : too many Member States are not implementing legislation they have agreed to and , frankly , that is a situation which is unacceptable . #% The jobs of one thousand people in my constituency are now at risk as a result of the decisions that were taken here yesterday . #% Yes , honestly ! #% Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner and wish to pick up on something he referred to rather poignantly : development aid through trade . #% If a Member uses force or violence , then that is not something that is a proper carrying-out of the duties of this House and therefore we were unanimous that the immunity should be lifted in that case . #% We were concerned about what the Council wanted to do in terms of the massive cut it demanded in that line , which was completely unjustified . #% Again , the realities of life on islands and in other remote regions make this test very difficult to satisfy , as no appropriate comparator may be available and the small size of the market creates problems where the average level of return for a given sector is concerned . #% I believe personally that we must make it clear that the Commission might take into account the way the most vulnerable have been helped , before agreeing any further assistance . #% It raises one billion a year , which can be used to get children into school and to abolish the fees that jeopardise the education of millions of children in developing countries , especially little girls . #% But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system , for example . #% It contains much that is wise , it leaves a lot to Member States under the principle of subsidiarity , but it determines a number of common principles . #% I believe the voluntary recycling commitments must be reinforced and turned into legally binding agreements . #% It is a step forward in what has already been a very long process , but it is a step forward towards what I hope to see will be a completed proposal before the end of this year . #% How else do you explain voting arrangements that do not come into effect until 2009 causing the collapse of the IGC ? #% She highlights this body 's role in managing fish stocks in the Antarctic and setting itself an ecological mandate . #% Not only have we been able to achieve - I believe it will be clarified that we have achieved this - the substantive negotiation on the Financial Regulation , which my colleague Mrs Gräßle will deal with in a moment or two , but we have been able to establish in our way of doing things for the 2007 budget a very prudent approach on payments below the 1 % , largely because we are at the stage of having new programmes for the Financial Perspective . #% He said it is a question of simplifying formalities . #% Madam President , on behalf of the European Socialist Group I would like to speak briefly , first of all , on the proposal by the Commission for the amendment of the Council regulation governing the rules for international carriage of passengers . #% Similarly we can not accept those amendments that deliberately try to weaken the position of people in the industry , whose duty it is to accurately point out incidents . #% We need to bear in mind that the abolition of tariffs could well cause a loss of public resources and , therefore , create budgetary problems . #% Whilst Mr Sterckx obliges ports not to turn ships away , Mr Savary says that they can deny entry if insurance certificates are not being provided . #% It has nothing to do with roads . #% We have sustained the objective of this directive because , above all , we want to encourage new creative artists to exploit this new technology . #% The problem probably came , as we heard , from waste water from an American-owned pharmaceutical company in Ireland , sent by an Irish waste disposal firm to a Belgian reprocessing plant that is now bankrupt . #% Perhaps in the interest of clarity and to avoid confusion , the Commission could change the title to something like `` Urgent Financing Facility '' . #% Mr President , I share the view of Mrs Maij-Weggen that the previous speaker , I have often thought , inhabits a rather sad and black world . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the British European Parliamentary Labour Party . #% However , I need to remind the Council - and at least we have one willing scribe down there if no one else is doing the night shift for the Council to get the message across - that really , if the Commission makes the proposal which we expect them to make , then they are duty bound , because of the interinstitutional agreement , to discuss with Parliament what that revision should be before their first reading . #% As far as external affairs are concerned , for example , the Union needs its legal personality . #% I welcome moves to improve relations with Iran . #% Now the disaster is to be imposed on the enlargement countries . #% We therefore saw the SWIFT agreement as a vital tool to help excise the cancer of terrorist financing and to protect citizens on both sides of the Atlantic . #% in writing . - We decided to abstain on all of the votes on Palestine and Israel . #% Aside from my own concerns about Albania 's political instability and how it will impact on the country 's EU aspirations , I am also sceptical about Albania 's strategic priorities . #% One thing I am pleased about is that Amendment 64 , the amendment on Cyprus , proposed by the Liberal Group , was rejected . #% And , as the co-chairperson of the ACP working party , I extend to Mrs Pery my hopes for every success in the future not only on behalf of this House , but also on behalf of a whole host of members from the ACP countries . #% IDA is currently working in the following areas : agriculture , humanitarian aid , the internal market , statistics , environment , trade , employment and education . #% If that is true in the United Kingdom , imagine the situation throughout the European Union . #% It is all very well having these regulations but we must surely all work together to ensure they are complied with . #% I was shocked to read that the opium crop this year was up to three thousand tonnes , overtaking even that of the Golden Triangle 's 900 tonnes in Myanmar and Thailand . #% I think it is absolutely outrageous and I will be writing to the President to complain . #% And to think that the CFP was not even in the Treaty of Rome : it was invented overnight to let Edward Heath have something to give away in exchange for the right to sign ! #% Mr President , if the European Union really wants to make a difference on human rights , it has to start to get serious . #% In the light of those studies , the Commissioner should give further thought to the number of jobs which will be lost and the effect on transport facilities both in the UK and Ireland and other countries affected . #% Finally , under Rule 7 ( 3 ) , I ask that the committee responsible , mentioned in this rule , look into the credentials of Mr Newton Dunn to see whether he has , in fact , proceeded in accordance with the Act of 20 September 1976 , as detailed in our Rules of Procedure . #% Can the Commission show Parliament an analysis of the agencies ' performance ? #% I was also pleased to hear the comments on implementation made by President Barroso . #% On maintaining open markets , we support fully his bid to forge international agreements . #% There is a moral , social , legal and economic case and a commonsense case for good public health policies to be at its heart . #% We believe that real progress on this will be of benefit to both our peoples . #% That is why neighbours worry and I understand the Austrian position in this . #% British Conservatives can not accept the report , based on the long list of ancillary items which are not on the agenda of the IGC . #% We must not therefore promote a solution which puts their livelihoods in danger . #% Further work needs to be done on countering the illegal export of arms . #% 
We get nothing but excuses and cover-ups . #% There is a little paragraph in here that you are going to streamline the regulatory approach , that is great , but where is it in your priority actions ? #% Mr Juncker , you say that the Stability and Growth Pact will be your top priority , but your past statements serve to illustrate only the inconsistencies . #% Self-regulation is considered to be the main instrument , underpinned by legal requirements where necessary . #% It is , therefore , fundamentally unsatisfactory when we come to plenary to find that we have a corrigendum deleting in paragraphs 7 , 9 and 10 the words ` European public prosecutor ' and replacing them with ` European judicial authority ' , which actually means something totally different . #% Mr President , I again would like to congratulate the rapporteur , the Commission and even , to some extent , the Council for the work they have done this year . #% Of course , we need to concentrate to some extent on the weaknesses but , having heard Mr Nassauer , I would perhaps call them differences in points of emphasis rather than weaknesses , if I may put it that way . #% Food supplements can be a tonic or a health aid . #% China was mentioned as a potential provider in the oral question and it may well be highly competitive . #% Recent history has seen wars and destruction resulting from that . #% I call upon her to give a clear indication tonight that there will be a positive response to this call . #% He is not currently the subject of any disciplinary procedure and the honourable Member should be aware that immediately after he ended his period of suspension last April Mr van Buitenen 's full pay , conditions , status and pension rights were restored , as were his rights in all other respects . #% A phased but significant programme of cuts in Pillar 1 expenditure should be introduced . #% To date we have been very much concerned with technical questions such as budgets and convergence . #% He obviously does not believe in parliamentary democracy . #% Finally , one of the great problems in our institution is that we have no statute for Members , assistants or political parties . #% However , these events must be put in context and we should acknowledge the resolve of the Turkish authorities to introduce a more human , acceptable , and indeed controllable , prison regime . #% That would be an abrogation of our responsibilities . #% I ask you to seek best efforts within the Council to unblock this very important proposal . #% I would therefore say ` no ' to Mrs Beckett on her views on transparency in the Council of Ministers . #% Now is a unique opportunity to influence the rights of those in Egypt whose human rights are diminished . #% We also have to be aware of what might be called the CNN factor , i.e. once we stop seeing this on our TV screens we think the problem has been resolved . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I ask you to share the sorrow as well as the anger I feel in speaking as a friend of Eritrea . #% If Europe wants to be a serious partner alongside the United States in the fight against terrorism and the spread of WMD , then it must work more closely with our American friends . #% First , it is right to record in a report by the Committee on Development and Cooperation that we can enunciate all the EU development policies we like , but too often these have been submerged beneath the EU 's own trade and commercial interests when it really matters . #% It is not just people working on building sites that fall from buildings or scaffolding , it is across a range of different industries . #% Privatisation goes ahead slowly . #% Yes , we must achieve a balance on privacy , on the retention of data and the use of data , but not to the point where we hand the terrorists and criminals an advantage that undermines our own way of life and gives them the opportunity to commit further atrocities . #% The suggestion I made some time ago that we should have a sub-heading has not found favour . #% I will send him a copy of my reply and when I have the agreement of Mrs Gradin for the release of the letters that we exchanged , including my personal letter to her of 25 January , written in an official capacity , he can see it . #% Both of them have done a first-class job . #% The question that occurs to me , which should perhaps have been asked earlier , is how the Clinton government ever thought it could persuade Congress to sign up to the Treaty . #% Yet this has just not happened . #% I am concerned that the EU continues to overregulate ; it continues to produce legislation that is too detailed , imposes too much red tape on enterprise , and is significantly harming the prosperity of Europe and its Member States , including , of course , the United Kingdom . #% Mr President , on a point of order , in connection with the point raised by Mr Evans , I too would like to thank President Cox for his visit to London today to pay his respects on behalf of the European Parliament on the occasion of the death of the Queen Mother . #% I hope it will enable us to identify , control and replace chemicals that are detrimental to our health and environment . #% It is always difficult to interfere in the customs of others , but it is important that , as a parliament , we transmit our abhorrence at this practice without delay to the Nigerian Government . #% There must be follow-up after the experience gained : the programmes must be properly evaluated . #% To improve things we need to change the quality of government . #% Of particular concern is the relevance of micro-supervisory oversight and whether the ECB , by dint of its role in the recent crisis , is automatically qualified to be involved so directly in this endeavour or whether it will carry with it significant reputational risk . #% Commissioner Rehn reminds us that full cooperation with the ICTY is a condition of EU accession but the truth is , as Commissioner Orban candidly told me last night in the absence of Commissioner Rehn , that there is no unanimity in the Council as to what that means . #% Madam President , since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors , may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House , but is also published on the Internet ? #% I think we are looking at it too much from a European perspective . #% At present , Member States are not required to make the convention directly applicable within their domestic law . #% The EPLP voted against the final budget resolution at this stage , to send a clear message ahead of negotiations between the institutions . #% However , this is done to show that we too have compromised to achieve this result . #% We have worked extremely well , as Mr Zver said , on his report , and we adopted the early years learning report in committee unanimously , which just goes to show that there is support across the political spectrum for this . #% I plead with colleagues to vote against the proposal by the two leaders . #% This would have stifled innovation and was totally contrary to the best business practice . #% The rule of law is a paramount strut of a civil society . #% The four Nice leftovers are not small or casual affairs . #% The culture of the brown envelope passing between ministers and senior officials has no part to play in a modern , dynamic economy . #% I understand that it was anxious to match action with resources and for that reason it rejected all those amendments that required it to take follow-up action . #% Are we up to the challenge ? #% I believe that such a report must come back to this Parliament before we rise for the European elections in May . #% Just on that last point from the President-in-Office , I think he has answered the point that Ecofin ought to put to the Council of Transport Ministers : some more objective studies are needed . #% Amendments Nos 11 and 12 , submitted by the ELDR Group , however , accept the Commission 's approach in principle , but seek to allow capacity increases on safety grounds by way of exception for existing vessels under 12 metres . #% This is a once-off package that is not setting a precedent for the future reform of pensions policy . #% We have often found through those petitions that there are a number of Member States that have very poorly applied the directives which are mentioned here and we have seen court cases resulting from that . #% We need to produce an action programme to enable the European Union to live up to what it signed up to in Kyoto . #% They do not report that only 54 % of the people in urban areas in Uzbekistan have access to sewage networks , or that only 3 % in rural areas have such access . #% I am sure this will please him ! #% I congratulate them on the progress made so far but none of us should deceive ourselves into thinking that we do not need a lot more work before Europe is truly open and transparent . #% Secondly , please assure us that the share of funding which might have been spent on those countries is returned to their national exchequers so that people can see clearly and transparently that their money has not been squandered on objectives they do not support . #% The Commission 's communication on development policy in 2000 called for us to refocus on poverty eradication . #% However , this bottle of wine from California tells you more about wine on a label three inches square -- that is 10 cm -- than most people will ever need to know , including the fact that it was matured in American oak for 12 months . #% 
I hope the Commission will accept those sensible provisions that Bill Miller has put into the report . #% Our group will not therefore support the 50-year moratorium . #% Compare that to Norway and Iceland who both refused to join the EU : their fish stocks remain plentiful and their fishing industries flourish because they look after them , forbidding discards . #% But where is the challenge from Europe ? #% Nevertheless I welcome what the Commission is saying . #% Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ? #% Indeed , if we listen to President Bush , the world will only be spared the consequences of climate change if such investment is stimulated . #% I will mention just two of them to demonstrate the range of the topics and the potential effectiveness of the mechanism . #% Without legal migration , we will struggle to meet our target of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010 . #% The Irish presidency has set a model of transparency and cooperation within the Parliament . #% If we were simply balancing the health and safety of children against the needs and priorities of industry there would be no contest , but there are related issues which we should address . #% As the honourable Member will know from other parliamentary proceedings at which he has been present , the Commission 's view and its action are completely consistent with our duty to uphold Community law . #% I would ask the President-in-Office if he could give me some assurance that it will be made easier for such companies to access such funding . #% Will Baroness Ashton deny that , while she was treasurer , she took funds from organisations that were opposed to Western-style capitalism and democracy ? #% But there has been a key problem . #% There is also a shortage of generic medicines , the cheaper medicines and other forms of treatment , which are just as important in countries where poverty is so rife and where water standards are so poor . #% Finally , may I record a brief message to Commissioner Diamantopoulou , whose successor has just been announced by the Greek Government . #% However , the refusal of the so-called low-cost carriers to sign up to this voluntary agreement and the low levels of compensation given to the victims meant action on a more formal basis was required . #% My last hope is that our debates will have brought the subject of private international law out of the dusty cupboards in justice ministries and expert committees into the glare of public , political , transparent debate . #% In that context I can tell Mr Miller that I am not supporting the two late amendments . #% However , the basis of the Commission 's perspective is the need for protection and our responsibility to provide it . #% The social and political situation has undergone profound changes in the past decade or so . #% The US position is not just contrary to the spirit of the Doha Declaration : it directly contravenes the letter of the Doha Declaration . #% We need further assurances and guarantees on transparency and market consultation and on democratic oversight , but I hope we and the other two European Union institutions can find a way to make these proposals work . #% I have asked SmithKline Beecham what is the genuine , long-term cost of production of these drugs . #% How many countries have refused export licences for arms ? #% If they can deliver that agreement for us , then I believe we will have a document that we can rightly be proud of . #% I hope the Minister does not believe the sanctimonious claptrap he read this House . #% HFCs are greenhouse gases like CO2 and , as the Commissioner said , whatever action we take on control of fluorinated gases , it can not be at the expense of the action we need to take to control CO2 . #% It may be difficult to get someone to spend the money to test these products for one particular species . #% As in so many of these issues , as before , we in Parliament , as elsewhere , have often been distracted by our own national concerns as opposed to what happens with the European economy . #% Parliament will continue to demand of the other European institutions that action is taken , that an international effort is made to tackle what is clearly a global problem . #% I would like to say yet again that we have a fundamental need to examine discharge procedures . #% Let us pause and reflect on the scale of the problem . #% The problems of extrapolating test results from animals to people and from laboratory doses to real life are now well documented . #% On that point , I would urge Members to support paragraph 33 and recital K of the original text agreed by the committee - remember the construction industry is not party to the social partners ' agreement on crystalline silica . #% The Commission is offering technical support to the Chinese in order to help them with the enormous economic restructuring which accession to the WTO will bring . #% I was disappointed to see the Committee on Regional Development voting in favour , although it did not do so unanimously , as Mr Hegyi stated , as I and several others voted against . #% As for Hong Kong , we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory . #% . -- I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue , together with other Members of this House who clearly take a close and committed interest in Sri Lankan affairs . #% Commissioner , it clearly comes as no surprise to you that the Left is strongly opposed to this particular directive and would prefer you to withdraw it , or at least neuter it . #% Those who are developing the euro plan to bring in a EUR 500 note - approximately GBP 300 , well over ten times the face value of the largest note in common usage in Britain . #% Granted there were questions on the past activities of two candidates in particular ; but both have been cleared by the national investigations that pertained to their activities and , in the absence of anything new , it would be difficult for the European Parliament to press this issue further . #% The background document is there for people to see and I hope that all Members of this House realize what a shambles the structural funds are in the United Kingdom and how that money is being manipulated . #% I do not personally believe that British bluster is as exportable or as healthy as British beef . #% Mr Brok 's report moves us in the right direction . #% If it is not , I suspect that my Group will find it very difficult to support the conclusions of the Amsterdam Summit . #% Once the key is turned , we will accord the best treatment within our power . #% It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired . #% The original logic of the Treaties , in giving the right of initiative to the Commission -- in those days the Commission proposed and the Council disposed -- was entirely right for that time . #% It does not work . #% On the global stage disabled people are the least recognised and most disempowered of all people . #% We have three outstanding problems . #% In which case , will that be possible without reopening all the linked issues , which we thought were solved in the Constitutional Treaty ? #% To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service , it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical . #% Secondly , it should reiterate the Council and the Commission 's commitments to keeping the Parliament informed of the enlargement process and of recognizing the important role the Parliament can play . #% I congratulate him on his grasp of the technical detail and his understanding of the problems associated with it . #% Let us not take it for granted that enlargement is on course to happen smoothly . #% A Commission lawyer has stated that it could compel the British Government -- and the British Parliament -- to punish its citizens for something that was not a criminal offence in Britain . #% But they also insist - and this is the case not just with Cancún , which most people will talk about , but in the EPA negotiations - that duty-free access to EU markets is simply not a sufficient spur to increase exports . #% Mr President , I too have a complaint about police repression outside the building , but it relates to Members of this House and not to dock workers . #% Seldom has the need for Euro/Atlantic unity been more vital . #% Firstly , nuclear weapons are not only immoral and inhumane , they are also illegal . #% Another is that the increasing professionalism of sport and the huge financial rewards on offer mean that the temptation to enhance performance through illicit drugs has increased . #% We have to commit ourselves to the ultimate goal , which is a stable and prosperous Europe . #% First , despite its strengths , in one particular aspect at least the previous Lomé agreement fell short , that is in the fight against poverty . #% 
It is ridiculous : we are losing the world for the sake of people wanting to drive around in giants . #% When the Commissioner comes to reply , could she perhaps say something on Amendment No 8 ? #% We are also opposed to an EU foreign minister and to a legal personality for the EU , and therefore , no matter how well intentioned the report is , I can not support it as it stands . #% We can not wait for an attack to take place before we act . #% That would mean , for example , that a travel agency in my region could quickly discount the risk for employees working indoors in its shops in the north of England , but that it had better take very seriously the risk facing its staff acting as company representatives in Mediterranean resorts throughout the summer months . #% It would be nice if , by the end of our process - maybe on the margins of our conciliation meeting with the Council on 21 November , or in our vote in December - we could come to a common statement by Parliament , the Council and the Commission on how we handle this concept of value for money on a regular basis , so that we can make it a part of our process , rather than something treated in an arbitrary manner . #% My last point is in relation to the citizens and the consumer . #% The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we , and our citizens , have no protection at present . #% UK Conservatives believe that we should vote against it for that very reason . #% Mr President , I want to deal briefly with a number of amendments about which concern has been raised . #% I will come back to that in a minute . #% That causes major congestion problems but it also causes major environmental problems as well - not only the noise and pollution for people living around the airports but also the impact on global climate . #% In the report , I drew attention to the fact that many sectors of farming , and the livestock sector in particular , are experiencing real financial hardship at this time , and there is now an urgent need to lower the burden , both in terms of time and cost , imposed on farmers by unnecessary and disproportionate regulation from the common agricultural policy . #% The EU has as part of its requirements for membership for Member States that they do not exercise or have on their statute books the death penalty . #% First , this week 's EU announcement of a new European Information Centre serving the business community in conjunction with Essex County Council . #% When resources are tight , we need to ensure that they are used effectively . #% There are some amendments put forward - three or four by the Greens - which , while nice , are not necessary . #% I have written evidence of many of these cases and stand happy to show them to anyone who wishes to see them . #% This report calls for high standards for reception of asylum seekers , to recognise that they are not criminals while their cases are being heard . #% I express our concern about the threat this poses to democratic societies and reaffirm that acts of terrorism anywhere in the world threaten peace and stability , but no more so than in India and Pakistan at the moment . #% author . - Mr President , the EU 's motto is ` Unity in diversity ' . #% I am glad that this report makes clear that the UK Government 's policy was wrong , and that we should be thinking about emergency vaccination if this situation occurs again . #% The root of the problem is that there is no credible means of enforcement ; there never has been . #% But what we did expect was the demonstration of a greater awareness of how to prioritise and implement key issues of social justice and environmental sustainability . #% A global trading nation that is very proud of its recent history does not belong , does not fit in with this club and , from your perspective , we are like the dog in the manger , are we not ? #% That is why one of my demands is further legislation on bus and coach travel , similar to that for air travel . #% Secondly , the fair competition argument that my colleague Mr Jarzembowski has already referred to - the need to create a level playing field throughout the Community . #% I thank our Commissioner and our High Representative and their staff for all their work . #% How will the Commission support efforts to build the kind of coherence that will be necessary now between NEPAD and the AU 's strategy ? #% That is why we urge colleagues in other groups not only to support greater transparency in the way in which these negotiations are conducted , but also , as Mrs McNally has already said , to give strong support to filling the current vacuum in the Convention and making sure that the European Parliament more generally gains the right of assent over all future GATS and WTO agreements . #% What steps has the Council or Commission made to calculate the cost of compensation or to initiate talks with complaining countries to seek to find an alternative means of maintaining the market for small banana producers ? #% Thirdly , what capacity do the Member States have for destroying the materials that are now being removed ? #% In the Philippines , for example , the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage would not longer apply to the clothing industry . #% It is now clear to all of us that the enduring legacy of the Orange Revolution , namely a lasting democracy and free media , is intact for all to see . #% Significant differences concerning test methods and conditions were highlighted and there was a general consensus on the need for harmonized test protocols . #% But we see on our television screens , certainly in Britain and France nightly , and colleagues in Spain have a similar problem , the way that the lack of a proper system manifests itself in tragedy . #% in writing . - I took the decision to support this motion for a resolution as I oppose the suggestion made by the Commission to reduce the financial envelope of the Programme for Employment and Social solidarity - Progress , by EUR 100 million and to reallocate this money to the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion . #% Let us be clear what we are talking about . #% Who liaises with whom ? #% Therefore , we support these reports and hope that they will provide the foundation for us to move forward into the next phase of European sport , a community spirit to build the industry and the potential of sport in Europe . #% I am probably the least surprised person about the findings of the Committee of Wise Men , because , as many colleagues know , since 1990 I have been pursuing a fraud in DG XXIII . #% When Mr Patijn meets the representatives of the European Disability Forum , as he will be doing within the next week , is he going to give them a more open answer and have a more open discussion than we have been able to have in this Parliament tonight ? #% That is the Commissioner 's responsibility , so we commend him on it . #% Therefore , if she will excuse me , I shall concentrate on the Lamfalussy procedure extension . #% I certainly hope that European journalists and publishers will get their houses in order on this issue . #% What of accountability ? #% They were there because they had been tortured , they had been mistreated and they were escaping . #% I , of course , welcome such a statement : it is essential for this process to work . #% The markets where competition is already allowed in this way are successful , transparent and highly liquid . #% Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future . #% If we get that right , we will have a scheme that is worth shouting about . #% Amendments Nos 74 to 78 , which deal with temporary MRLs , bring the legislation more into line with Directive 91/414/EEC . #% The rapporteur has talked about the carcinogenic and mutagenic problems of chromium-6 but , of course , nobody is realistically suggesting that the levels of chromium-6 in cement pose a risk . #% The economic vitality of youth is replaced by the recreation of the elderly . #% However , we wish to record that we disagree with the concept of quotas as implied , for example , in paragraph 12 of the report . #% However , at the end of the day I was confronted with a text which was so blinkered in its approach , so faulty in its assertions and , it has to be said , so unfair in its criticism of the efforts that were made in my country at all levels to combat BSE that I felt I had to put the record straight . #% As a result , national authorities , in their haste to conform with the requirements of the Commission in this area , will be neglecting other duties which are actually far more important . #% They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading . #% The fact is that ECU 1.2 billion will be reallocated within Category 1 because of the effects of the mad cow disease . #% Commissioner Schreyer and I sent a letter to all DGs in July 2003 . #% I was there in 1986 protesting about Mr Haider ' s discrimination against the Slovene speaking minority in Corinthia . #% It is not often appreciated that speculators can be Member State governments , for example , who might hold off paying money to the European Community , expecting to have an improvement in their national currencies ' exchange rates against the ECU . #% That is why I agree with Mr van Velzen : we must make sure that this work programme is understood by the public , and that it is important to the public ; and we have to work with you to deliver that work programme . #% Finally , I agree with all those who are saying that it is extremely important that the Parliament be kept informed of the implementation of this agreement . #% That was contradictory , and Parliament was obliged to address the issue through a separate motion of censure on the Commission , thereby destroying the direct link between refusal of discharge and the consequence of the departure of the Commission . #% Finally , to clarify a point that Mrs Eriksson made , the reference I made to very limited rights , such as the right to attend language courses , relates only to people who have the right to marry , or the right to have their partnership recognised but choose , for whatever reason , not to exercise that right . #% 
It is very important that we get movement in that area in the Transport Council . #% I would strongly recommend the House to vote against those amendments tomorrow . #% So I strongly support President Barroso 's push to improve decision-making on justice matters , with laws on police and judicial cooperation and legal migration progressed through more effective and democratic and open methods . #% I find it absolutely unbelievable that these two countries could find themselves in this particular border conflict . #% We are concerned that the art market may move to New York and to Switzerland . #% But whether the current WTO can actually deliver those outcomes is frankly much harder to believe . #% I think we would all do well to remember that in the coming weeks . #% No military action should be taken anyway without the explicit and full agreement of the United Nations Security Council , which must meet again on this issue . #% Cooperatives are particularly important when we are talking so much - or indeed today so little - about corporate social responsibility , when we are looking at companies which have a great deal to teach , at major corporations that already operate across borders , in terms of their responsibility towards staff . #% South Africa must begin to show leadership and demonstrate that it is committed to democratic principles in the region . #% By giving those setting up the teams the discretion to determine their composition and to express objections when necessary , it seems to me that this point has been tackled very effectively . #% Political vision is what we need to see now . #% British Parliament votes are expressed in current sterling values and are not subject to automatic adjustments for inflation . #% This report proves that beyond doubt . #% I can therefore only urge the Commission to take the most effective and rapid action . #% The Environment Committee is the committee responsible within the European Parliament for the original regulation on aircraft noise and we have watched with some dismay the reluctance of the United States to accept that the European Union is within its rights to insist on bringing the regulation into force by the due date . #% As we entered Bosnia we saw a huge election poster for President Tudjman of Croatia . #% At the same time there was a tension in Lisbon between the old world of the international socialists and the new world of those who have a slightly wider perspective . #% The information society is going to be one in which consumers have tremendous power to shop all over the world and particularly within the boundaries of the single market . #% Therefore , it is particularly important that we now get money for energy efficiency into the economic recovery programme , and I hope the Commission will not delay with its proposal on this . #% I can quote an example of a public house in my constituency which served lunches . #% One central task facing Member States is the full implementation of the Lisbon Council conclusions in terms of stimulating employment , essentially by boosting the competitiveness of their economies , their companies and their people . #% I share concerns about free movement of people , but this is a problem wider than Turkish accession . #% We ask for a reform of international financial institutions , greater transparency of markets with more financial information , better supervision and regulation of the financial sector and controls over short-term lending and speculation . #% Thirdly , we encourage the ECB to fulfil its role on the international stage as one of the three main pillars of the international monetary system . #% I think you are right to be cautious about sudden initiatives of this sort however worthy or well-intentioned and however massive we all know the scale of the problems are . #% A joint committee of European and national parliaments would be an excellent way forward . #% Clearly the European Union , as the largest exporter of services , has a strong interest in opening new markets for services . #% Therefore the VDR is , if anything , a preventive tool . #% Long , active and fulfilled lives depend more on socialising than exercising , and it is important that as many as possible of the needs of the elderly are addressed within their local communities rather than addressed at a distance in the towns and cities . #% We can fairly assume now that there is agreement between Parliament , the Commission and the ACP that there has to be ring-fencing over a five-year financial framework . #% One of its working groups is examining ways in which even collective defence , a core task of NATO , might become a European Union responsibility . #% I would like to ask where is the European Union ? #% I hope the rapporteur will not take this personally , as I know how much thought and work she has put into the report . #% Because a crucial element in this quick transposition is that the European Union will be able to accede to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Treaty and that will bring a very important measure of global protection to all the artists involved . #% But I am sure he would understand my concern when he says he will comment when reports become available . #% Enough talking , now let us move on . #% That symbolism was reinforced for us when we went to Mostar where we were told by the authorities that one of the biggest stumbling blocks to a lasting peace and fair elections in Mostar remains the Croatian community which is clearly encouraged in its defiance of Dayton by the government in Zagreb . #% There are deep concerns that the kidnapping of Wall Street journalist Daniel Pearl may have involved renegade pro-Taliban members of the Pakistani security forces . #% Indeed , mention has already been made of the taxpayer having to bear the burden , but if we made this compulsory , it would be Member State taxpayers who eventually would have to stand in place to guarantee this . #% It is our responsibility to use them . #% The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement . #% The fundamental point is that human rights in China remain absolutely dire . #% Will she accept today that some of the criticisms levelled at the PACTE programme are because some of her officials do not like the large number of small projects the PACTE entails : they prefer the bigger figures in the article 10 programme ? #% Consumers will be the ones to lose out , if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled . #% You chose not to . #% It is somewhat anomalous that , at the moment , it is easier to move goods or capital around the European Union than it is for European citizens to move around . #% If that is not the case , could he give me an example of some situation where non-dialogue has worked ? #% If that facility is available to Vice-Presidents - and good luck to him - is it available to other Members ? #% In May 2004 the EU Council promised to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus , but has done little about it . #% It is dangerous and premature , and surely of doubtful legality as Mr Cappato said , to endorse a blanket EU regime of data retention as an add-on to a telecommunications single market package . #% I congratulate him on the skill with which he has negotiated the eight compromise amendments that were passed in committee . #% A German minister was quoted as saying ` when it becomes necessary to drain the swamp , you do n't stand around asking the frogs ' . #% I have had nothing . #% At the present time there are five prisoners in a Saudi prison accused of apostasy and they are facing the penalty of death by beheading . #% We appreciate very much the huge efforts the Finnish presidency has made to work very closely with Parliament . #% It has not always , in its stormy passage up until now , had that benefit . #% It is an area which we as a society can no longer afford to ignore . #% Regarding agricultural products , at the moment we are deeply worried about the cost of production , supply and security of food . #% We need common coding amongst the institutions so that the process of accessing information is simplified . #% Efforts must also be concentrated on social issues . #% As a result , it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come . #% Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf referred to young farmers in his report . #% In spite of the rhetoric that we have all been involved in this evening , there are some very concrete ideas in Mrs Billingham 's report . #% Will you please , Madam President , send her a message of support from this Parliament and also urge the Norwegian Nobel Institute to express their deep concern about the fact that she is not able to join them on Saturday in Oslo . #% But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa . #% 
Our experience should widen our vision , strengthen our position , so that we may seize the opportunities that lie within the management challenges that we face . #% Thus all seemed plain sailing , until we had the rapporteur 's proposal to reduce the figure to 250 mg , whereupon we had the Commission 's brainstorm . #% I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress . #% I would suggest that we ought to set a date , such as January 12 , by which , if nothing has happened , we proceed with the sort of strong measures that we have suggested . #% So to start the process of the Commission 's recuperation , may we insist that the outgoing Members of the Santer Commission apply voluntarily the Prodi Code of Conduct . #% Mr President , I would like to express my thanks to Mr Holmes for his work and join in wishing him a speedy recovery . #% Finally , as the Socialist coordinator , can I thank all my team , but also my fellow coordinators from other groups for the sterling work and the cooperation that we have shared with each other during the last five years . #% The benefits to be gained from these proposals are too small for us to take that risk . #% You can not cherrypick in negotiations , this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East . #% Does he agree with me that we need to have a Council of Defence Ministers if we are to address these questions ? #% Two years running we voted to allocate resources from underspent budget lines to buy this much-needed equipment . #% A solution has to be found quickly for reasons that my colleagues have already outlined . #% Although it is a real mouthful , we can point to the IDA successes as bringing real benefits to European Union citizens in ways that really touch their lives . #% I would urge the UK Government to take this up and use it in a very efficient way . #% Those who are carrying out these assaults are anarchists : they misuse the name of Islam for their anarchical aim to restore dictatorship with themselves in power . #% Europe must do more as well . #% All in all it has been a good debate and I should like to thank all those who have taken part . #% I would like to conclude by saying again to Mrs Hermange that she has produced an excellent report but one that we must make sure that we put into practice . #% Serious mistakes have been made . #% Once again this morning , this House voted for appropriations for Turkey , a country with a decades-old record of poor human rights . #% We should start by defining clearly their scope and nature , and then we should establish the qualities and experience of the people needed to fill them . #% Our committee and , indeed , our Group has been emphasising , since this new Parliament started last year , the need to encourage the development of small - and medium-sized enterprises across the European Union . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , this report on the Commission 's annual policy statements gives the members of this House the opportunity to remind the Commission of a number of points which we set out in the financial perspective . #% My problem is with the lack of experience of our High Representative for Foreign Affairs , Cathy pass-the-bucket Ashton , with more than a few roubles in it , no doubt . #% It is crucial that the Ombudsman should have the widest possible access and I agree with comments made by colleagues concerning the need for greater openness . #% They make up 8 % of the population , which would be considerably larger if it had not been for the fact that , because of persecution , many have fled to Jordan and Syria , where they live in terrible conditions . #% Mr President , as the last speaker from my group and as coordinator of the group , it falls to me to try and summarise the positions that have been expressed . #% Movement restrictions were not effective in the early stages . #% It just shows in other words that we are equally guilty of protectionism . #% We are going to have to draw attention to the sinners who are not implementing European legislation and take fiscal action against those who are not implementing legislation . #% I find that deeply worrying and I would like the Commissioner to explain exactly what that means . #% I have tried my best in committee to make sure that all political groups and Members are taken along with me in the work that I have done . #% Local authorities , we would agree with the Council , are important because that is so often where discrimination is most closely felt , on housing and the specific needs of the Roma people there , on education , and on the police whose job it is to protect and not simply to criminalise , as seems to be the way in some Member States . #% I should like to have some assurances that the Council will be represented at a sufficiently senior level to offer the respect which this Parliament traditionally offers when these sorts of visits occur . #% That is what we have requested , and we expect a strategic report to be presented by 30 September 2003 . #% I also welcome Parliament 's insistence on the rapid implementation of this directive for all Member States , whatever the current state of employee representation . #% Would the Commissioner agree with me that given the sensitivity of this sector of the economy this is a disgraceful way for the Council and the Commission to try to steamroller through a piece of legislation that should have been given proper and transparent consideration ? #% There are three words I would leave you with if I may - openness , flexibility and innovation . #% Could you ask the Committee on Rules of Procedure to look at the following point : we all respect the principles of power with responsibility and subsidiarity so every time a group asks for a recorded vote could a certain sum be debited from the budget allocated to it by Parliament ? #% We have reinforced the role of the Commission , but again I wish we could have done more in relation to spot checks on the application of the Schengen , which was not possible . #% If it is postponed , the matter will be left over to a newly-elected Parliament which will be relatively unfamiliar with the subject . #% Mr President , I almost feel sorry for Mr Alexander , but I am going to resist the temptation . #% In this year , the 20th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster , minimum standards for companies are required which will reduce the number of victims of abuse across the world in future years . #% Any party that can contend that signing up to the social chapter and the regulations made , and to be made under it , increases flexibility in the marketplace does not deserve to be taken seriously . #% Generally speaking , I am delighted that at last we are going to have clear labelling and , as I said , I want it to be the country and region of origin . #% The European Union now has to find its own way forward . #% Indeed , the treatment of children in Romania , as the Commissioner mentioned this morning , rapidly became a global media horror story . #% There have been advances : a lot more resources are devoted to the artisanal fisheries , to improving the fisheries of Guinea and so on , in all sorts of ways that have been mentioned before . #% I hope this is the case and I would ask for a reassurance on this point from the Commissioner . #% I strongly commend the resolution . #% The point is that in managing very substantial change that affects our institutions and the people who work for them it is in nobody 's interests to delay , evade , or unnecessarily prolong the deliberations . #% Whilst we take these measures , there is no progress on the pressure that some of us in Parliament have been trying to exert on the Council in relation to the need for sanctions - sanctions , of course , which Aung San Suu Kyi has consistently called for . #% Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector , there is still far too much fragmentation in this area . #% in writing . - I was pleased to support this report in its vote through Parliament . #% Indeed on 7 March the Iraqi permanent representative to the UN yet again , despite this evidence , claimed Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction . #% I welcome many of the amendments put forward in terms of employee involvement and greater safeguards there , responsibility towards customers , wider society and indeed , for many of them as well , the investment they make in ethical finance , which again has a lot to teach major corporations . #% Nigeria will unquestionably be in my opinion in violation of a number of international treaty obligations including the Convention against Torture and the UN Convenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which it is a signatory . #% The sections dealing with annual leave can not be negotiated away and it is important to bear that in mind : i.e. the nine years for junior doctors applies only to working time - average weekly working time - and the other provisions of the directive apply after three years . #% This is not good enough . #% Albania is a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , an increasingly powerful and influential lobby in the UN promoting the interests of its members and voting as a bloc on human rights and foreign policy matters . #% It is because we want to give more purpose and prominence to this procedure that the ELDR intends not to sign the current eight-page list - not because we object to the contents , but because we think this is in danger of becoming an annual ritual performance without substance and real meaning . #% As Commissioner Prodi himself recently stated , very high political ambitions have often been achieved in the EU as a series of small , almost technical , steps . #% Women pensioners are the worst off of all ; fully 25 % of women pensioners in the United Kingdom today live in poverty . #% That may all seem a long way away , but if the brave people of Burma can learn anything from us in this Parliament in Europe , it is that the light of liberty can never be extinguished by tyranny and that the freedom that is their inalienable right will surely once again be theirs one day . #% I should like to congratulate the rapporteur who I know has worked very hard on this proposal . #% We in this Parliament accept that the pressure to meet the deadline , indeed the commercial and industrial pressures of the progress of liberalization , make some cross-over almost inevitable . #% 
We must ensure that the European Year of Volunteering is used as a platform for recognition of the contribution volunteers make to our communities , but also use this as an opportunity for us to better understand the barriers to volunteering and what we can do to help remove them and push volunteering forward . #% It raises the question as to what the real proposals of the Commission are . #% I turn now to the contentious matter raised and the reference to the Greens ' amendment on health insurance . #% What we do not want is to line up the Commission head to toe and find out that all that is left is inconsistency . #% For example , in the Committee on Petitions we are still receiving petitions from citizens of Europe who find that their higher-education qualifications are not accepted in one country or another . #% Does the Council not feel that , in view of the fact that these sculptures were taken from Greece under Turkish occupation , they are not something in isolation like a painting , but are part of the Parthenon , a building , and they ought to be returned there ? #% We are making a brave attempt here . #% Ethnic minorities such as the Karin and the Shan continue to suffer violent oppression , and there are over 130 000 refugees in camps on the Thai-Burma border . #% Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our galaxy , the Milky Way , there are about 300 billion stars , many with planets . #% The first deals with the application of the precautionary principle , based on the ALARA proposals from the World Health Organization . #% To leave things as they are at present , with 15 competing national jurisdictions , will be a cause of confusion and future problems . #% Is this a role of the common agricultural policy ? #% Instead of having to use 15 separate prospectuses to reach retail investors in the existing European Union , in future an issuer of bonds or shares will only need one . #% That is where we have to be careful in what we do . #% I want to talk to the general budget rather than Parliament 's budget . #% These initiatives are vital to changing people ' s attitudes . #% Everyone wants gender balance in theory , but finds a pretext to fail to deliver it in practice . #% It is encouraging that the Commission realises that this crucial step towards an entirely new human resource policy , means creating a whole new culture where people are promoted on merit , where we have a linear grading structure , where there is not an artificial ceiling for promotion , where there is much more delegated accountability . #% Firstly , his remarks about the weakening of Mr Rugova 's position must concern us all . #% Putting all these regulations together I have to ask whether considering our firm resolution , which I am confident we will pass with big majorities tomorrow , you should consider threatening to withdraw each and every one of these three regulations unless the Council is willing to agree to a better compromise . #% Similarly , if a failure to respect United Nations resolutions were the criterion for war , then there are numerous other states to which the same reproach would apply . #% The ECB must be out of its tiny collective mind to encourage the wider circulation of such banknotes , and I believe Mr Smaghi has much work to do . #% It needs to be sorted out before the constituent sitting in January . #% I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal . #% Rule 35 ( 4 ) says that the committee should have disputed the validity of the proceedings regarding the period of reflection and the ratification process . #% Mr President , Article F of the Treaty of European Union requires the Member States of the European Union to be democracies , a provision which has , if anything , been strengthened by the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% However , arbitrary detention with no possibility of appeal is totally unacceptable . #% These are channels through which we Europeans could convey our experience of using mutual respect to overcome hatreds , helping Israelis and Palestinians strengthen their dialogue . #% Mr President , four weeks ago we heard the news that the European Court of Justice had said in answer to a British Government case that Sunday was not to be a special day for health and safety reasons . #% Europe has 15 times higher a ratio . #% I would say , however , that it is worth looking at what is going on in Commissioner Verheugen 's work on cars in the context of an integrated competitiveness initiative . #% Surely there is a better way . #% Believe me . #% We are laying down a solid body of work , a solid body of information and some very important precedents as we move towards the setting up and launching of the new chemicals policy that we expect to come from the Commission very soon . #% Finally , we do not agree that common initiatives undertaken by Member States in the field of foreign affairs should be totally taken over by the Commission rather than left to the Council . #% I urge him to set up this office without delay - we have already lost too much time . #% On the contrary , recent events underline the need for stronger transatlantic ties , and an enhancement of NATO , rather than the potentially divisive pursuit of some autonomous EU military capability . #% It is an excellent step forward in shaking off the last vestiges of the image of the UK in particular as the ` dirty man of Europe ' . #% If less than 80 % is spent there is a black mark . #% Mr President , I thank the Commission , all Members , and the industry and user groups who have taken an interest in this subject and who have sent me many contributions about their problems , suggestions as to how they might be resolved and the difficulties with the original proposal . #% I would particularly like to thank the Commission for its generous help , as well as my colleagues , the shadows from the other groups , for their very constructive and cooperative suggestions . #% Many of us continue to be alarmed by reports from inside Zimbabwe about the situation on the ground . #% The report notes the existence of overlapping directives that might lead to contradictory and duplicate requirements . #% Which are they ? #% China 's deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world and pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers ' rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive at all costs . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , whatever people feel about the outcome of the Iranian elections , there is no doubt that tens - hundreds - of people have been injured , tens of people have been killed in the protests that have taken place since the elections in that country , and thousands of people appear to have been detained as political prisoners . #% It would be a very good signal of the resolve of Turkey to carry on with European integration should the Supreme Court decide this case at the very moment when Turkey takes its seats inside the Convention . #% However , we can not support the committee amendments . #% In Gilgit and Baltistan , the people are kept in poverty , illiteracy and backwardness . #% In conclusion , as rapporteur , I welcome this historic EU maritime agreement with the People 's Republic of China . #% He presented us with at least 60 pages of complex technical mathematical calculations and he challenged us : is this the sort of thing this Parliament should be considering ? #% The cost to British farmers is enormous . #% It was supposed to have made it possible for a firm or a company complying with its own home rules to have a passport to trade anywhere across the European Union . #% How is this going to be determined through a qualitative analysis of growth , and how is this going to fit into this coordination which we are hoping to see in future ? #% For those who are already Members , as well as for those who soon will become Members , Parliament 's rights will be strengthened as a result of the enlargement process and not weakened . #% If we fail to meet that commitment , what does that say to the racists ? #% In my view , Montenegro is now ready to start negotiating EU membership as an official candidate , and it is curious that the Commission should be insisting on a significant time-lapse between the granting of official candidate status and the opening of negotiations . #% That is absolutely right because , as Mr Karas said , increasingly the distribution of rights is no longer going to be centred around national monopolies . #% Two years ago we approved the National Emissions Ceilings Directive and the Ozone in Ambient Air Directive , for which I was rapporteur . #% I like some of the suggestions in her report . #% How will the European Chemicals Agency really interpret its remit and how will REACH be defined in practice ? #% In the world of networks traditional jurisdiction-based disputes-resolution procedures are of no real help to consumers and traders when things go wrong . #% There is clearly a risk that Europe will now be forced into a corner in the talks with China . #% It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94 % of the cases brought to court . #% Perhaps such a new evaluation mechanism would help prevent some of the differences of opinion and lack of confidence in the current system which we are hearing not only in this Chamber but right across Europe at the present time . #% We owe him a great vote of thanks and I am sorry we are losing him . #% 
To be European is also to encompass a generous inclusivity about people 's notions very different from our own . #% However , my personal interest in this subject is more focused on how services can be used as a tool to help the poorest people out of poverty . #% One of the reasons that they have not reported is that the countries themselves do not know . #% Mr President , as we have just heard the proposed directive is effectively the linchpin of the common asylum policy , setting out the basis for minimum standards for people qualifying as refugees under the Geneva Convention and subsequent protocols , and also the criteria for people entitled to international protection under other international conventions and human rights legislation . #% Mr President , I congratulate my colleague , Mr Linkohr , on this report . #% They may in the end be able to reach the standards that they agree to , but we have to ask how long this will take . #% It smacks of a public scapegoating exercise in the face of embarrassing evidence of official covert support by the government . #% This is an important development in the context of the many exciting advances being made in genetic identification , treatment and , best of all , prevention of diseases . #% This annex is almost incomprehensible to MEPs so it would be utterly incomprehensible to MPs in national parliaments . #% On the contrary , I have only heard very positive remarks at all times concerning what can be done . #% This judgement is important , not just for Europe ' s past , but also for its present . #% But this is just one of the ways in which EU funds are wasted . #% The powers for the Commission need to be circumscribed and time-limited , as indeed they were in Parliament 's amendments and in the presidency compromise . #% First , from my Group 's perspective , we will be taking the view that Mr Wynn has just expressed : we would rather be very prudent about whether we need the financial perspectives at all . #% We must remember that these generations deserve the same sort of pension security and safety and sustainability as that which we are talking about for ourselves . #% We have decided to suggest that those countries who have not replied so far should not be sent wastes until they do . #% It is a violation of the tenets of democratic freedom to deprive Lim Guan Eng of his seat in Parliament simply because of his mild criticism of the Malaysian government . #% It would be a real shame to risk the high level of trust that those nations have shown -- among both the governments and the people -- being lost . #% However , it goes deeper . #% But is Commissioner Vitorino aware , not only of Mr Haider 's and the Freedom Party 's words , but also of their deeds ? #% In other areas the Union has a coordinating role and in still other areas it contributes with complementary actions . #% However , I would not be telling the truth if I were to say that we were unanimous in our support for the final report we voted on last night in committee . #% Has that led to a lessening of the regard for rights ? #% I am sure the Commissioner and Members of this House will know that the Court has already taken a view in a very similar instance and there is , of course , the worry that this particular course might lead to further actions in the courts brought by the operators or others who are affected . #% It is only the Council that can seek action from the Commission to ensure that the postduty-free regime is clear and transparent to the consumer and the enforcement agencies . #% This itself is graphic testimony to the abject failure of the measures thus far implemented . #% I urge the Commission to come forward with these as soon as possible , hopefully having discussed things with Parliament 's own administration before doing so . #% When are we going to have the Commission 's proposals on amending secondary legislation ? #% Second , in order to retain the current system for 2004 , there would need to be a Commission decision providing for a waiver to the rule in the Financial Regulation that requires a call for proposals that is accompanied by adequate monitoring and control provisions tailored to the results of risk analysis and backed by a joint policy declaration by the three institutions . #% Whilst management of coastal zones must remain predominantly local , national strategies to support and coordinate action are vital . #% Equally , I welcome the recognition of the role of the Indian military and police in carrying out abuses and call upon the Indian Government to do all within its power to end such abuse immediately . #% My final point is that certain aspects of the text before us are highly relevant to the state of affairs being brought to light by the Kralowetz case . #% Madam President , you have presided over 358 separate votes just now . #% They are going to be disadvantaged because , under the new proposals , there will be a payment on historical claims . #% The universities of Britain take postgraduate students from across the world , pursuing their studies further and sharing their information , not least with commerce and industry . #% There are very grave doubts about the hearing of Commissioner Kallas , who , as you know , is in charge of the anti-fraud drive within the European Union . #% The problem could of course be solved by much greater control of national budgets , but that does not seem very feasible right now . #% I am more confused now that I have heard the Commissioner than I was before . #% The Commission could consider supporting the development of a website on concession schemes available to older people in the Union . #% Why are these missions being postponed ? #% Mr President , no sooner had Sudan emerged from 21 years of bloody civil war between the Islamist Government of Sudan and the Christian/Animist south , finally ended by the comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi this January , than another appalling humanitarian situation emerged in Darfur in February 2003 , whose importance internationally must be reinforced now that attention may be drifting away following the tsunami in South-East Asia . #% Mr President , I am standing in for my colleague , Mr Mombaur , who is unable to attend as he is unwell , to give the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy . #% So , if a vessel with no papers lies offshore and then , due to extreme weather , becomes at risk , it must be allowed entry because Mr Sterckx established the right of ships in distress to a place of refuge . #% This strongly worded report has been compiled by Members of the European Parliament across the political divide , from all Member States and with Romania 's best interests in our hearts . #% We have seen improvements in the effectiveness of cross-border cooperation between public administrations and what is now being proposed is that this be extended to businesses and to citizens . #% The second big message is that there has been a failure by both the Commission and national governments to implement existing energy efficiency legislation . #% In terms of the risk , the World Health Organisation estimates that , while 90 % of exposures to this risk are in the developing world , 90 % of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union . #% There must be a recognition of their work and their rights on the land and within the country . #% This is not a party political issue . #% We preside over one of the world 's great periods of extinction . #% So what are the cuts proposed by the Council ? #% The choice of whether to apply the rules is only a fig leaf to disguise that reality . #% There are , however , sadly , many other examples of flagrant abuses of human rights on a considerable scale by the Indonesian Government . #% We are no longer dealing with a situation where a law is being implemented , but rather it is being interpreted in a novel way . #% Could you answer that before I make my other remarks ? #% I know many of my colleagues in the Chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around Europe saying it all must go to this one organisation . #% Our task is to help keep them firmly on that road . #% Those of us who have studied the matter closely are certainly able to welcome the real progress that is nevertheless being made by Turkey to reform its prison system . #% One million Tamils live in the north ; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese . #% On the question of uncomfortably high levels , I would like also to draw attention to the points that we made in our resolution , recital B , to the historically high levels of unemployment here in the European Union : currently 18 million people unemployed with 50 million suffering from social exclusion . #% As chairman of the Committee on Budgets I find that to be an anathema to everything we have fought for . #% The ceremony of raising the ten new flags yesterday was wonderful and moving , but the image it presented was exclusively white . #% Can it be because you know you would suffer a humiliating defeat ? #% Everybody is aware that this is very difficult . #% Even more so in the future , Kosovo will be an expensive commitment for the EU , but the alternative of chaos , ethnic conflict and crime is even more expensive . #% I have in mind particularly Ukraine , which is locked in a political struggle between westernisers and those who wish to see it join a reinvented economic union with Russia and the eastern republics . #% 
Mr President , I am sorry to speak now before the vote has begun but my comment relates to the first amendment on which we will be voting . #% The most difficult point has concerned the removal of the possibility of capacity increases on safety grounds . #% With peace we can rebuild communities and with rebuilt communities we can ensure that fundamental human rights are respected . #% The same , to some extent , applies to Parliament . #% I have always voiced my concerns at these repeated attempts to circumvent national parliamentary scrutiny . #% It is important for me to emphasise straight away that the EPP is in agreement with the aim of the French initiative . #% A diplomatic college would only become necessary if the EU were to take control of foreign affairs away from the Member States . #% I want the Council to take back this message . #% We are very disappointed that Amendments 10 and 13 were passed by Parliament . #% Even if they were competent and even if this were a high-quality Commission -- sorry , Mr Barroso , but I do not think it is -- we would still vote ` No ' on the political principle that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties ; the Commission is the motor for integration ; the Commission initiates the legislation that is damaging our businesses across Europe so badly ; the Commission is the embodiment of all that is worst in this European Union ; the Commission is the government of Europe and is not directly accountable to anybody . #% By way of illustration , I make reference to the fact that , despite what we demand on paper , the debate sparked by the election of the new Palestinian Authority clearly spelled out that implementation depends primarily on the political will of the EU to assign priority to human rights issues over economic and political interests . #% Over four million still suffer significant injuries at work each year . #% I should also like to thank the Commissioner and his team for their fine work in the field . #% Save the money you are currently wasting on the EU , a large part of which is lost simply by fraud and corruption anyway . #% Action is also needed to encourage greater use of our ports , seas and inland waterways . #% We must also offer to East and Central Europe , through forms of European assistance , Commission programmes , through the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and other bodies , solutions that will solve their energy needs and ensure that in future their energy will be supplied on the basis of energy saving and sustainable environmentally-acceptable energy generation . #% Whilst I accept that Member States may have an interim option to adopt measures which would save companies from this unfair competition , please could you tell us when you are going to save everybody in the Union from it and take some action through the task force ? #% This is the place to discuss the burden of proof rather than the overall principle of precaution . #% The second point I want to make concerns Euronews . #% This is particularly salient in Africa -- the venue of the conference -- which has been blighted by a series of tragic civil wars from Zaire to Liberia and Sierra Leone and which are characterised by insurgents and rebels , often heavily armed and financed by third parties . #% Nonetheless , we voted in favour of the resolution with our reservation , due to the importance of this timely report . #% This particular resolution follows up that initiative , and pressure must be put on all the parties at the Consultative Group meeting to give relief at last to this long-suffering country . #% This is a measure we could have taken through in one reading . #% We need to ensure that there is adequate funding to enable citizens to do that , where appropriate . #% This directive essentially controls experimentation in contained facilities or the use of GMMs ( genetically modified micro-organisms ) , again in contained facilities . #% The report also goes so far as to recommend additional measures aimed at protecting the rights of all European citizens , such as those with disabilities . #% But using an individual 's progress in language as a criterion as to whether to grant long-term status is discriminatory . #% But ` Ode to Joy ' is a complete misnomer to 41 % of the population , and 58 % of the British population . #% I want to underline two parliamentary achievements in particular . #% It is found in rhododendrons , camellias and native tree species and , last month , it was found in wild woodland in the UK . #% The particular circumstances around extraordinary rendition will have been investigated to death by the time our committee is established . #% That must help my city , London , and all the major cities of Europe . #% This report , which I am pleased to present on his behalf and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is an important part of the Legal Affairs Committee 's remit on behalf of Parliament to encourage simplification and good-quality drafting of Community legislative instruments . #% I am not sure whether experience in the egg industry features on your lengthy CV , but I wonder whether I could urge , through you , that cooperation take place between the Spanish authorities and the Commission to try and resolve the situation , so as to avoid people calling for a ban on the import of Spanish eggs . #% The Commission has agreed to forward to Parliament all the information laid down in the interinstitutional agreement that we already have in principle with the Commission . #% I must say at the outset that I yield to no one in my condemnation of terrorism and terrorist acts , and this issue affects not just Spain but all countries in the European Union . #% Yet this paper steadfastly ignores the road sector and is thus completely unbalanced . #% Developing countries have shown a new determination to resist such marginalisation . #% The development of an autonomous EU military capability , separate from NATO , has come about as a direct result of initiatives by the British Labour Government in 1998 . #% I have in mind one area which I understand is not subject to WTO discussions : energy . #% Well , that is my wish list . #% It is important to emphasise , therefore , that officials on personal leave continue to be subject fully to the provisions of Article 12 of the Staff Regulations , which require officials to obtain permission before engaging in any outside activity whatsoever and which also allow for refusal of permission or imposition of conditions where it is considered that the activity would otherwise be detrimental to the work of the Communities . #% Commissioner Barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms , not necessarily to conclude them . #% Six months after the Commission decision their worst fears about not finding work at their age have proved only too real . #% If it needs clarification , it is down to the Commission to do that . #% Insurance has to be as foolproof as we can possibly make it , because that is what consumers expect . #% Mr President , we should recognise that this report is a celebration of the fact that the war against rabies is being won across Europe . #% The UK is one of the worst offenders in this respect . #% If we can achieve that sort of Europe from the Lisbon process , it will be good for our citizens and for Europe as a whole , because what could be more socially just and inclusive than a Europe that genuinely benefits from full employment and good jobs that everybody can enjoy ? #% A linked point is the sort of cooperation he perceives is being offered by Internet service providers in being able to take down offensive sites that are reported through the hotline service . #% Regardless of this , however , the punishment of homosexual acts between consenting adults by flogging and up to 20 years imprisonment is an outrage . #% As the City of Strasbourg and the French aviation authorities seem incapable of providing a consistent or reliable service to this great city , and in view of the clear wish of both Members of the European Parliament and the peoples of Europe that we do not waste any more of their money , is it not time seriously to consider once and for all the future of the monthly plenary sessions held in Strasbourg ? #% There never seems to be an ill wind that can not blow the European Union some good . #% I wish to come back to a point the Commissioner made in his speech . #% In our view , without the effective work of the Commissioner and the Council , in cooperation with Parliament , the new round would never have been proposed , let alone launched , and for that we are grateful . #% Will the Commissioner say this afternoon whether she thinks they are right in concluding that the acquired rights directive - which they thought would give them protection - has been a totally worthless piece of European legislation ? #% I wish to welcome the proposals on fruit and vegetables , in particular the move to allow up to 20 % of produce to be sold directly to consumers at the farm gate or through farmers ' markets . #% As someone who has consistently complained that the plight and even existence of the Assyrian community is being ignored in Iraq , it would be hypocritical of me to collude in exactly the same way for the case of Turkey . #% We have had no reply as such from your office - no doubt due to an oversight . #% Like disease , crime knows no borders . #% This is a model example of not only cooperation across parties , but also cooperation between institutions in ensuring implementation is properly and fully pursued . #% So they know his conviction is unsafe , but he could still be executed . #% It is also essential in increasing competitiveness as the EU overcomes the economic crisis . #% Mr President , firstly , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of her presentation for what is a very fair and balanced report . #% In 2009 we should revert to the current situation of three vice-chairmen of each parliamentary committee and five Quaestors . #% Mr President , the recent events in Turkish prisons are tragic by any standards and it is an enormous pity that the situation had been allowed to deteriorate over such a long period with the almost inevitable consequences . #% 
These are the worries and fears that some people are trying to raise . #% It deleted the reference to the fact that measures aimed at improving convergence go hand in hand with the promotion of growth and employment in the medium term . #% Mr President , each of the countries referred to in this report is different and each of the plans varies accordingly . #% Hopefully then , the report will go through but we will have put down a marker . #% Thirdly , there must no blood relationship in the first or second line between partners . #% Yes , we appreciate Russian cooperation in the fight against terrorism , but that is no reason to turn a blind eye to humanitarian atrocities by both sides in Chechnya . #% There are currently more than a thousand grassroots public information relays and networks overseen by the Commission 's Directorate General for Press and Communication . #% That concludes my second speech . #% Mr President , when Mr Dimas replies to the debate in a moment , I would like to ask him if he can specifically reply and give us the opinion of the Commission on Amendments 111 , 112 and 94 and the amendments that the previous speaker has just mentioned about nitrates ? #% Hundreds of thousands of men , hundreds of thousands of families , are affected by the disease each year . #% I hope even at this late stage that the governments concerned - including my own - might see sense and help us put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that flexibility can actually be a positive concept for both employers and workers . #% We particularly applaud two firsts today - the appearance of the report in Braille in three languages , and the use of sign language in the debate . #% Finally , we have to recognise that we are limited and do not have an acceptable internationally-recognised test to identify hormone-mimicking activity by chemicals . #% The key point is getting the right balance between the different interests involved - the incumbent broadcasters , the mobile operators , broadband provision and the official users , including the military and civil emergency services . #% Finally , now is not the time to eject 80 000 Kurds , breach environmental standards and human rights , in order to construct the Ilisu dam . #% The solution is to move to a different kind of gas that does not present the problems that HFCs clearly do in that sector . #% This is an important directive . #% The extrajudicial killings of young people and others must stop . #% So , in adopting all these reports , I hope the House will continue to monitor closely the situation in the countries concerned . #% I very much hope that the governments of those ten Member States give their citizens a chance to vote again in referenda , because they will be voting on something quite different from what they have been sold at the moment . #% My first reaction when I saw this directive was surprise . #% It is also seen in our own differences over what kind of framework directive best regulates the business of consumer relationships and where and how unfair practices can be identified and redress sought . #% It will also be our problem to resolve thereafter . #% I am particularly pleased that this report includes support in the language or dialect of the victim of crime because sometimes that is an area that is overlooked . #% By doing more on energy saving , we are also tackling the very practical problems that people face in their lives . #% We need specific performance tables ; we need the opportunity to name and shame , to point the finger at those Member States that pay lip service to the idea of sustainable development , but do not match their fine words with deeds . #% Mr President , we have had 50 hours of hearings and nothing to show for it . #% Given that my parliamentary question is referred to this debate , will Mrs Bonino in her reply , and the representative from the Council taking note , commit themselves to investigate this individual case and the anomalies in European immigration procedures between Member States which threaten his status . #% It is not in any of our interests to require steps to be taken that would hinder the efficient and economic operation of this industry . #% March 22 is the EU 's last chance to complete this agreement and to show real solidarity with our partners in South Africa . #% I see that Mr Kirkhope is not here , but I am conscious that he raised this issue in an earlier debate . #% I welcome what you said , Madam Commissioner . #% I feel that the European institutions can congratulate themselves for coming to a reasonable and effective agreement on this issue . #% But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult . #% For example , Saudi Arabia barely gets a mention . #% As such , small computer companies are left , one might say , between a Rocard and a hard place . #% I look forward to building on the foundations of this directive . #% Finally , on sanctions , we should not forget a simple message : the sanctions are not causing the suffering of the Iraqi people . #% Mr President , the PPE-DE Group is in full agreement with the rapporteur , Mr Andreasen , on what we regard as an excellent report . #% Usually , in a lot of countries , if legionella bacteria is found in any part of a building , that building is closed . #% I commend this report , the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy 's additions to his work . #% The evidence that worried me was given last November . #% What they did not give us was any training for our motor mechanics or spare parts . #% My question is , who asked the bureaucrats to spend time considering such stupidity ? #% I have no doubt at all that public service television has played , is playing and will continue to play an important and valuable role in serving the viewing needs of the public . #% Thirdly , we have to step up our efforts to make this an international code of conduct , not just a European code of conduct . #% We are overloading the wish list of the IGC . #% In taking a lead in developing a vibrant , dynamic European economy , President Barroso will have our support . #% I should like to thank Commissioner Lamy for that full answer . #% We know that growth does not guarantee jobs but without growth jobs will not be created at all . #% The report has made significant headway in terms of reaching agreement between industry and citizens on important issues such as bullbars and pedestrian-friendly car fronts . #% In conclusion , the European Council , headed by the Danes , is sleepwalking into the future . #% We know that 5,000 Moluccans have died . #% This can not be the way to do things . #% Let us put them to the test now . #% It has come to my attention that a group of parliamentarians from the EPP Group visited the USA in July . #% It has to be done in a way that is both humane and effective . #% Given the aviation content here , and with due deference to the rapporteur , I can only conclude with a phrase that really will not translate from the English : `` What a Messerschmidt '' . #% There must be an enforceable peace based on an international force which has NATO as its core . #% Parliament has consistently asked the Commission - and I know the Commissioner has done some work on this , for which we are grateful - and the Council to come up with proposals for a European regulation . #% Tackling climate change is one of our highest priorities and is the kind of issue where we expect and want the European Union to take a strong lead . #% What is most worrying is the sudden regrowth of racism , homophobia and anti-Semitism in Poland , aided and abetted by fellow-travelling colleagues in the current Polish Government and European Parliament . #% I and my group are proud that we have achieved a compromise that delivers and protects fundamental freedoms . #% When the peoples of Europe want a single European state , that will be the time to call for a European Convention , and not before . #% I have been reproached for agreeing to the European arrest warrant , while very strongly supporting individual rights . #% We must also concentrate on where the problem is , and that is poultry , and in particular eggs which are eaten raw . #% 
It is totally unacceptable that those who seek to bring about improvements in animal welfare should be told by the Commission to put up the white flag and run away from the battlefield even before we know whether the enemy is armed . #% I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals - this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued . #% Mr President , I would like to get this debate back , as my colleague Mr Karas said , to the people who really matter in all of this : our citizens receiving public services . #% We are concerned about what a significant step it would be to bring rating agencies within a regulatory framework or a registration scheme , and we must be cautious in our response to recent financial scandals . #% When I spoke to you some months ago in this very Chamber you said that by autumn we will have made progress . #% We have to grasp the scale of what has happened this week , but we must move on and forward in a way that meets with the approval of the European people as a whole . #% The second concern relates to budgets . #% Secondly , politics is about responding to changing events , and there has been a historic event in recent days that has been tragically overshadowed by the events in Gaza . #% Furthermore , I continue to object to the fact that neither CAP nor Commission accounting procedures have been satisfactorily reformed before enlargement . #% It is also very timely because Professor Monti came to our committee on Monday to talk about his mission for the President of the Commission on the future direction of the internal market . #% But what they did campaign on , what you all campaigned on , was ` Vote ` yes ' for jobs ' . #% They are about to miss a great speech , but there we are . #% In Carlisle we have a new strategy for flood management -- making space for water , undertaking integrated urban drainage pilot schemes to investigate how the threat of floods can be better managed . #% Under our Rules of Procedure , you join a political group on the basis of political affinity . #% Rights have to be equal wherever you live within this new Europe , whatever the colour of your skin , your ethnicity , your religion or whether you have no religion at all . #% Secondly , we must be open with the public about where experimental crops are being grown . #% Firstly , the alternatives are not developed in every single sector . #% Any proposals to undermine the moratorium on field testing and marketing of these suicide seeds must be firmly rejected , and that is what our group has tabled an amendment on tomorrow to strengthen that point . #% Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned ACP and LDC countries . #% Because we have done it on the basis that only by acting together can we achieve more than we could ever achieve by acting alone . #% It is a particular pleasure for me that the agreement was reached during the first UK Labour presidency . #% That should be the rule wherever there is an attempt to introduce annualisation and that principle has been safeguarded as a result of the conciliation . #% Firstly , whilst the Commission does exercise the natural modesty of any responsible authority , I could not accept from the honourable Member that we have a lot to learn about internal disputes . #% I ask you for an assurance that the recorded vote for Thursday will be corrected in accordance with the two letters I have sent . #% Therefore , we feel that the present diplomatic mission by Kofi Annan needs every support . #% We are very keen that a study should be made on the feasibility and the pros and cons of insurance systems , but we do not feel it is appropriate at this stage to make any future compensation automatically dependent upon the existence of insurance schemes . #% But Mr Verhofstadt has to lead the Council towards a resolution of the problem , posed by the failure of Nice and by the Irish referendum . #% Mr President , if I heard the Commissioner correctly he said the possibility of guidelines ` could ' be considered . #% The elimination of trade-distorting agricultural export subsidies in 2013 is three years later than hoped for , and amounts to a symbolic gesture to the world 's poorest farmers . #% At present , Members , committees and Parliament itself can not do their jobs properly because of excessive secrecy . #% in writing . - The EPLP wholeheartedly supports the report aimed at amending Directive 2000/75/EC with a view to allowing the use of inactivated vaccines against bluetongue outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions . #% Along with Mr Blokland , we have retabled that amendment for plenary to consider . #% In terms of facts and the political consequences that we should be drawing from this , it is almost irrelevant whether there have been two or three renditions as we were told in the US by the US Administration , or whether the facts unearthed so far reveal two or three renditions , or whether we have found more . #% If they do , that is fine ; if they do not , then the wording needs to be changed from ` do comply ' to ` do not comply ' , for factual reasons if nothing else . #% We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved . #% Mr President , a number of amendments to the budget were adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% But of course it is also of concern to us that we are supposed to have a travel ban on President Mugabe and his associates . #% They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection . #% - We all applaud the coming of the second age of railways , and acknowledge that market liberalisation can continue with economic opportunity and public service needs to bring it about . #% Experts tell us the chances of infection are one in three for hepatitis B , 1 in 30 for hepatitis C and 1 in 300 for HIV . #% The savings on allowances that are no longer justified will make other investments possible . #% It will not . #% In addition an IMO code of conduct covering the issue already exists . #% I turn first to the internal market questions and particularly the issue of registration tax on cars which I recommend should be abolished . #% As he reiterated in committee earlier this month , he felt that the three institutions were not far from agreement , and a close inspection of the common position proves this . #% I understand Commissioner Monti is going to reply today . #% It is not acceptable for insurance companies to refuse cover on the basis of genetic profiling or for manufacturing companies to recruit those with a low propensity to cancer for dirty jobs . #% Mr President , I refer to the comments made in this Chamber on Monday afternoon with respect to the anti-nuclear demonstration at the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland . #% Therefore , I say this : to do nothing is not an option , we have exhausted what we can do in this House and this will be resolved in the Court of Justice or before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , and it will be to the shame of the Partido Popular in Spain . #% If there is a need for qualifications or training to move to the next job the development process will identify that . #% So that is what this report is about : it is actually about setting the framework . #% It is hard to over-estimate the importance of this process to the competitiveness of our European economies in the widest sense . #% Mr Happart is not right when he says that chocolate as we have always manufactured it is ersatz chocolate . #% Immigration and asylum policy should in any case be decided by democratic nation states not the European Union . #% This will require a huge investment in building capacity and a serious analysis of the implications of the impact of reciprocity on our ACP partners . #% I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries . #% This `` Son of Star Wars '' system threatens a massive new arms race . #% The powers that the President has are not that much different from the powers enjoyed by President Yeltsin , yet Yeltsin is the person so often to be appeased . #% Our citizens are telling us that the Euratom Treaty is not working , so we should listen . #% In particular , we must ensure respect for intellectual property rights , appropriate tax regimes , effective competition policy and maximum transparency in the relationship between public and private institutions . #% It is important to address the requirement for safety of vessels of between 24 and 45 metres in areas outlined in the directive such as fire protection , life-saving and radiocommunications . #% Mr President , I am pleased that Mr Prodi is here to listen to this . #% I hope the group has the political honesty to accept that it continues to support that point of view . #% Mr Bullmann 's original report gave us a comprehensive reminder of a number of issues concerning employment , social cohesion and the importance of sustainability , but I think we saw considerable tension introduced with that report , with certain EMAC resolutions ; not least , paragraph 25 and its push for liberalisation with no qualitative evaluation on the social and environmental side whatsoever , and paragraph 36 , which tells us that the European Union did a very good job at Doha in our push for the liberalisation of world trade as the catalyst for international growth . #% I was elected on a manifesto commitment to fight fraud and maladminstration and it is very difficult to explain to my voters , the good people of Louth and Horncastle or of Derbyshire , why for ten years the accounts have not been signed off by the European Court of Auditors . #% It is a sensible solution allowing Member States to monitor and control the market and make sure it is not flooded . #% 
I have a concern that in this instance , therefore , Mr Bossi does not come to us , as we would say under English law , with clean hands . #% I am thinking of the coordination of social security for third country nationals . #% I now come to the intolerable situation we find ourselves in today regarding the extension of the voluntary beef labelling scheme . #% All these are major priorities for the ACP . #% Never again should farmers be able to say with truth that they are unaware of exactly what they are feeding to their animals . #% I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur , Mrs Fajon , for her hard work and the way that she has included all the nuances in every twist and turn of her deliberations over the last two months . #% This is because we have had amounts put in the budget for 2003 , but before approving them we want to enhance the position of the other institutions - Parliament as well as the Commission - in knowing how policies will be implemented . #% The Western European Union Armaments Group , for example , moves very slowly on the basis of consensus . #% We believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole European Union on the move . #% At the moment the Minister for the European Council and Human Rights , is reported in today 's issue of Milliyet , the daily paper , as being firmly against capital punishment . #% Mr President , I was one of those who was selected at very short notice to go as a member of the European Parliament 's ad hoc delegation to observe the referendum and the partial by-elections which were taking place at the same time for the Belarus Parliament . #% I agree , and in this respect , 2007 was no different from previous years . #% I believe Parliament , the Commission and the Council of Ministers must back the proposals by the Labour led people 's coalition for reinstatement of the 1997 Constitution and , in the spirit of national conciliation , for the formation of a grand coalition for the government in Fiji . #% This is an entirely self-generated problem which , furthermore , raises unnecessary difficulties for key allies such as Turkey . #% To make an awful English pun , I would say that this report is ` packed ' full with her energy and commitment . #% The core of the EU is the Single Market and there can be no weakening of it . #% Unfortunately , ASEAN 's own recent financial wobbles may have obscured Mr De Silguy 's message . #% But we should also do nothing that makes it harder for us to trace those who , for whatever reason , might spread an infection and endanger others . #% But the EPP it seems , and others opposite , clearly do not want that . #% We also advocate support for Amendment No 44 , which seeks to clarify that onboard equipment is not compulsory . #% So it is with great pleasure that I tell you that in my own country - the UK - this Friday , a biannual awareness and fund-raising extravaganza for Africa , called Comic Relief , will see otherwise serious citizens don red plastic noses to raise cash and a laugh in solidarity with Africa . #% We are now beginning to see the problems of the office not being completely independent of the Commission . #% It shows we treat Turkey 's candidacy for European membership with the respect that it surely deserves . #% But the Commissioner is riding between two horses : one seeks to protect endangered species , the other seeks to assist the poorest parts of Europe . #% Consequently , many jobs depend upon the safe dealing in that currency and we therefore support this initiative in protecting against counterfeiting . #% The justification for this exception is that taking away the possibility of financial assistance is likely to bear hardest on the sector and put safety improvements more seriously at risk in circumstances where they are likely to have only minor effects on capacity . #% Some of the resolutions , I have to say , are an overreaction to the latest incidents , which , technically I do not think are as serious as some people have made out . #% We need to look for common rules and common understandings and agreements on legal aid so that , as far as possible , people can receive the sort of support that they would expect in their own country . #% America is not the problem : terrorism and extremism are the problem . #% This was not , may I say , without resistance from certain political groups in this House . #% By an overwhelming majority it voted for a controlled , gradual liberalisation down to 150 000 with no end-date for liberalisation . #% This , then , is the final step in the edifice : the implementing measures internal to this House to enable us to apply the legislation that was adopted last year -- legislation founded on a very broad consensus , as I have just indicated . #% As she said in her introduction , she has made the very wise decision to focus on what are the most critical issues for the creation of the single market . #% They can not cope , not just with the disease , but with going home to their families and telling them they have got breast cancer . #% I agree with the Commissioner that we are all responsible for our own actions , but he seems to have made general statements of concern about human rights in Colombia without responding to any of the specific questions put to him . #% Kaput is kaput in any language ! #% I call on both sides - the Ethiopians and the Eritreans - to pull back from the brink of what would be an enormous tragedy and to go forward with mediation . #% It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers . #% I was wondering whether or not the Commissioner could work through that agency ? #% The BBC , not renowned as a friend of Israel , has reported that 15 out of 16 of the Palestinian men killed by the IDF were known terrorist militants . #% This would be retrogressive and would undermine the collegiate outlook of the Governing Council . #% The political response of governments and other institutions to racist and homophobic attacks is crucial and sends very strong signals . #% Firstly , let me refute some arguments that various speakers made . #% It seems that it is the French and German Governments that are the main supporters of lifting the arms embargo on China , as well as the controls on exports of dual-use nuclear technology . #% It seems to me that to just look at the commitology aspect of this particular directive now and to hold up this measure is not the right way of proceeding . #% I thank him for the progress we have made during this morning 's debate , particularly over timing and the clarification of the position of the Council . #% If that is the aim of Cardiff , Mr Cook has the full support of this House . #% The first point concerns the section of the communication on trade for sustainable development . #% I would hope that we could send a very clear message from this Parliament to the G8 meeting in Birmingham that we are all in favour of them urgently addressing the issue of world debt . #% Let me now focus briefly on Mr Sterckz 's report which I shadowed for my group . #% We welcome the commitment to greater transparency and trust that this will not just be for the Council but for the public as well . #% The Commission has conveyed its warm thanks to Mr Ertsbøl . #% They were not appalled . #% It is clear from the second annual report that there is rapidly growing cooperation between Member States , both in terms of implementing the code and of achieving greater mutual understanding of the interpretation of the code . #% But the rapporteur said something which struck me , as did Mrs Maes . #% European citizens seeking to protect fish species from extinction can have no confidence in a Commission DG which seems to have sold its soul to serve the interests of the Spanish fishing industry . #% Would you give us a deadline for this - would it be a matter of weeks , months or years ? #% However , despite this Parliament appearing to win the case in the European Court of Justice , nothing substantial has changed . #% We need to reintroduce that element so that from Galway to Gdansk and beyond we secure that reunited continent . #% When , however , it is a question of its own personal rights , the rights of its Members - particularly the financial rights of its Members - Parliament would be well advised to tread more softly . #% So basically we re-establish the PDB , but with emphasis on our political priorities concerning research innovation where we have had additional appropriations . #% So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland , destroying local wild animal stocks . #% Europe has to be part of making that happen . #% Not only has the Commonwealth benefited by being brought into the Lomé Convention but also individual partnerships have been formed , such as the one we are discussing today . #% I want to stick to the question of the Net and how it has changed our whole view of electronic communication . #% These countries have not taken the euro and the UK has not indulged in the more restrictive employment practices . #% 
In successive years , I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds . #% You were not here last night to hear Mr McCreevy make his barnstorming speech . #% As such , I welcome the concepts of prevention and producer responsibility ; these will go some way in ensuring that the onus for implementing these measures is evenly spread across European citizens . #% People felt a sense of anger and despair . #% in writing . - By voting in favour of the joint resolution tabled by the S&D , ALDE , Greens and GUE , I feel I have shown my support for freedom of the media in Italy . #% I congratulate both of them on their patience over a very long time in dealing with this ; after all , it is not a new proposal . #% Firstly , we are unconvinced by the benefits of agreements which are of huge cost to the European taxpayer and yet seem to supply limited benefits to EU fishermen as a whole . #% We know that epidemics run through channels of illegality and deceit -- epidemics , not pandemics . #% There is a saying : ` If you do not change direction , you finish up at the point you were heading for when you started out ' . #% Madam President , I am very grateful for that . #% We need a common methodology to be applied by each of the institutions and the agencies - we must not forget that the agencies and organisations set up by the institutions must apply the regulation . #% For this reason we voted against the measure at first reading . #% If we are able to succeed in creating such a practical forum , we should be able to expect that this sort of sad critical incident will be put firmly in the past . #% Here we have a non-nation trying to abolish our nation . #% We do not want to regulate all equipment sold on the high street but the interfaces should be regulated for vision-impaired people , for instance . #% Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest , as required by of our government bonds , made returns of 5.2 % a year , barely half the 9.5 % annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996 . #% It is for that reason that this resolution properly demands that the spirit of the Convention - transparent , pluralistic , political - should be brought forward to the IGC . #% When we adopted our original timeshare legislation I hoped that the long queue of people coming to see me about problems would come to an end . #% I return to the issue of give and take in relation to one specific point -- the budgetary powers of the European Parliament . #% The Socialist Group warmly welcomes the initiative taken by the British Presidency to seek to establish a code of conduct on arms exports . #% There are supposed to be sanctions against them and the fact that he can travel to conferences like this makes something of a mockery of those sanctions . #% By drawing up contracts directly with the regions , the Commission can enter into legally-binding agreements with local and regional bodies on regional and other policy issues such as the environment . #% Of course if they are guilty they should be punished , but they should not be in a worse situation than they would be in their own country . #% Absolutely central to this process is the reform and adaptation of the CAP to meet the future needs of a wider Europe in the 21st century . #% What a number of continental countries are trying to do is to engage in that reform process through consensus , while preserving the underlying values of the European social model . #% I am alarmed to hear the Commissioner 's conclusions because it certainly does not seem that the trophy hunting to which I referred is being done with the aim of conservation at all . #% The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else 's responsibility to see that these matters occur in the proper way . #% The police tell us that those who are deported are often retrafficked around and around in a vicious circle , rather than being seen as vulnerable individuals , or indeed as potential sources of information . #% That needs to be addressed urgently as part of a preventive healthcare strategy . #% It is important to be absolutely clear on unmarried partners . #% We believe that the evidence we heard in the foot and mouth inquiry demonstrates that preventive slaughter is not necessary , it is not desirable , it is not economic and it is not efficient . #% I wonder if it is maybe being unnecessarily demonised , to provide an enemy that the Greens can use in their campaigns . #% Indeed this is written into the Joint Declaration and Basic Law which guarantee the continuance of Hong Kong 's existing way of life for at least 50 years . #% One of the things that our own research has done , and this committee commissioned research on this topic , is to demonstrate the fact that there is nothing like enough coordinated activity on helping people to recognise their rights under mutual recognition . #% I understand the requirements of the European regulations but I make a plea that Council considers the earliest possible action and communicates its severe anger not only to the authorities in Rangoon but to the European companies which are supporting them . #% But once again you could not accept a democratic result , oh no - the Irish have to vote again ! #% In all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained . #% This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public . #% I welcome the Commission 's communication and I agree with the Commissioner that we need reform of state-owned enterprises . #% Growth is slowing down , but stimulating and restoring that growth will be crucial to the responsibilities of both Presidents over the next six months with that Economic Summit at the centrepiece . #% After the successful conclusion of the Kyoto conference in Bonn , the Commissioner told the press that we could now tell our grandchildren that we did something to tackle the problem of climate change . #% We appeal to the Commission to assist in the provision of humanitarian aid and , when it is possible , with the clearing of mines . #% The nations of Europe can be proud of their record on human rights ; however , have they needed charters ? #% The peer pressure exerted by this greater transparency of decisions that relate to infringements by Member States may also help to promote more rapid conformity from Member States as they all now learn immediately of the decisions taken against each of them . #% The British Conservatives voted against this report due to growing concerns about the effects and implementation of such agreements . #% Mr President , it is a great pleasure to speak after Mr Spencer , after such a moderate and reasoned presentation . #% On the treatment of taxes and social contributions , I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given . #% However , I repeat that aviation is the safest form of public transport and accidents , however tragic , are thankfully rare . #% Deep sea fishing - here is an area unique in its case which proves the rule that this working time directive is fraught with practical problems . #% Basically I would like to see the introduction of a guaranteed standard level of assistance for young farmers throughout the European Union . #% For once , I disagree with Commissioner Verheugen . #% But we differ with this resolution in relation to an EU seat and changes to the veto system . #% After all , the Muslim Brotherhood , Hamas 's spiritual mentors in Egypt , were not allowed to stand on a platform advocating a violent overthrow of their government . #% They are all rattling off the denials , but this has not satisfied those who have expressed concern or deterred calls for parliamentary or judicial inquiries in a string of European countries . #% That clearly is going to be very significant , not only for Europe , but for business round the whole world . #% Demands for development linked to the promotion of food security , which is being promoted by many developing countries , were completely ignored . #% We also know that he who pays the piper calls the tune . #% Whilst welcoming the extension of the work of the ad hoc commission advising on pardons for prisoners unjustly convicted of terrorism offences , we call for full judicial review of these cases , and for full compensation to be paid in accordance with international human rights laws . #% We may say that quite definitely not all the income has been declared and that is why this Parliament has established a Committee of Inquiry into the transit system . #% The EPP and ourselves have tabled a compromise text which I hope will win support in this House . #% These are two countries , the leadership of which actually fought alongside each other in trying to get rid of the evil regime of the Dergue - the communist regime in Ethiopia . #% The World Bank says that nearly half of the Palestinians there live below the poverty line . #% For those who do not understand what I am talking about , I am referring to the timing of their submissions for both the supplementary and amending budgets , which meant that we would not have the chance to debate them in full . #% If we want to have growth and stability in the European Union , we have to boost investment . #% Given the way in which the Charter seems to have been able to set its own terms of reference and its own limitations ( or more accurately lack of limitations ) , it is necessary that fundamental questions be answered before it is allowed to develop further . #% I know that you are not going to do that over the course of the next six months , but I think you have got a real problem . #% 
We want an interest rate policy for all of our citizens , not only for the rich heartland of the European Union . #% Clearly , the UN was designed for the Cold War period in which permanent membership status and veto rights were necessary for the nuclear powers to ensure global security . #% I am sure you can imagine the shadow this disease casts over me and my family . #% Where access to wildlife is restricted , people will have to adapt and continue to adapt in ways that entail even greater risks . #% They must shoulder their individual and collective responsibility to win these referendum campaigns by showing the voters why these reforms are for them and why this is truly the Constitution for Europe . #% Integration in the world economy can not be an end in itself in comparison with bringing the poor themselves to market . #% I still am . #% It is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend . #% I can assure her , however , that there is no sphere in which the Commission will act irresponsibly . #% It gives much higher protection than the legislation which is currently used in the crop trials now taking place in the European Union . #% We have to reconcile the interests of human health and those of animal welfare , and it can be done . #% Commissioner , you mentioned the ongoing evaluation that you will be making over the next two years . #% Yet , there are good ideas . #% After all , we all put a lot of work into it . #% Madam President , very often Members of this Parliament are called on by our citizens to set out the benefits and disadvantages of the European Union . #% We obviously need to persuade those countries that have not signed , and in particular the United States , Russia , China , Pakistan , India - some of the main producers of landmines - to sign up . #% The committee also stressed the ongoing importance of Eurocontrol . #% The spring meeting of the European Council looking at Europe 's economy takes place just at the moment of an outbreak of protectionism in a number of European Countries , especially France . #% This is a clear sign that constructors and developers wanted to continue to exploit the loopholes of the previous law . #% As a former Northern Ireland minister , I have been a terrorist target and I have faced the TV cameras surrounded by the wreckage of a terrorist incident . #% The dialogue on migration is making good progress and there are no indications that cooperation will not sustain progress in future . #% Even now I am not too sure that the Commission will even achieve those limited aspirations in the light of what the Council is saying . #% The British Government refuses to provide the GBP 1.5 m needed to build an interceptor tunnel to stop these overflows . #% But we need to recognise within the EU that not all companies are able to evolve in this way . #% They can no longer communicate in confidence . #% We also object to the idea of an EU military mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo and for an EU defence budget . #% So , how did we do it ? #% Added to that are the complex needs of the sectors in the industry , of which there are at least three : the in-patent sector , the generic sector and the over-the-counter sector . #% We welcome , too , the efforts made by the Egyptian Government to investigate the allegations and secure the refugees ' release , but we should also be focusing on why these unfortunate individuals flee in the first place . #% The fourth point on the Costa Neves report is the Commission reforms referred to in paragraphs 7 , 8 and 9 . #% This is not the occasion for a debate on legalisation and I know there are some amendments on that . #% The fisheries policy is not working very well , nor is the Stability Pact , but -- to maintain the pretence -- we are now going to have a more flexible pact taking into account economic growth rates and country-specific circumstances . #% Should you decide in December 2004 to start negotiations ? #% It may be that horsemeat is accepted in other countries . #% I am very pleased that on this side of the House at least the majority of colleagues voted against the proposal to extend health benefits to retired Members . #% I hope that 1999 will be a year that we will remember , when Europe as a whole began to combat violence against women and show respect for human rights . #% Madam President , I would like to inform the House that , as a substantial rightholder in the audio-visual sector , I have a direct financial interest in the issue before the House and will accordingly be abstaining throughout . #% I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food . #% But when I was in Mali and went to see the services there for people with diabetes , I saw one room in a clinic and one in a hospital with people with amputations of legs and arms , losing their sight , their liver destroyed and facing early death . #% This leaves a very sound basis for his successor and my group would also like to add their thanks for his work . #% In my view what is needed is incontrovertible scientific evidence , not speculation . #% Therefore , in this budget we want to prepare the Union for enlargement , we want to make sure that reforms of the institutions are carried out , but above all we want a Europe which is going to play its role in the world . #% There can be no doubt that the Brussels Convention made enormous strides in simplifying the jurisdiction rules applicable to cross-border disputes but they are still a lawyer ' s dream and a litigant ' s nightmare . #% This work programme is part of that wider context . #% We now have a supply chain which means that in many cases research and development has pushed down the supply chain to the first , second or even the third-tier suppliers in this sector . #% That was absolutely spot on . #% In fact , it complicates the Transatlantic Alliance , produces no additional troops and has no real purpose , except to shift defence and security decision-making responsibilities away from NATO headquarters - where European countries sit around the same table as our American allies - to the European Union , from which Americans are specifically excluded . #% On the issue of data retention , Groucho Marx has been referred to tonight . #% The Constitution will significantly reinforce that democracy by extending codecision , by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so-called comitology system for delegated secondary legislation . #% Another of my amendments that was accepted -- which I was pleased about -- concerned the need to undertake more research projects at European level on various conditions that affect European citizens and , perhaps more importantly , for any information to be disseminated across the European Union . #% We must be mindful of the extra burden which can be placed on small enterprises and ensure that we are not adopting any sort of regulation which risks undermining their livelihoods . #% While the fighting has cooled off , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan this week appealed for an African force of 12 000 troops , up from the 7 500 expected by August and the 2 500 African Union troops who are already in the region . #% Could you transmit this back to President Cox to say that many of us felt that as it was such an important announcement we should all have been involved in that announcement . #% At the same time we need to prevent artificial barriers being put in the way of the opening up of markets . #% Well , Mr President , colleagues , let me tell you that I agree with Mrs Wallis . #% I am particularly grateful to the Council , also , and I am pleased that Mr Deldrup will be speaking as well , which I think is an indication of the importance that the Council attaches to this important file . #% If you are going to take account of regional and local conditions , it probably means that you are going to upset the conditions of fair and equal competition . #% Certainly , it was not unequivocal in any sense in the way that it dealt with the situation in Zimbabwe . #% It currently enjoys privileges , such as the PCA Agreement , a strategic partnership based on the Four Common Spaces Agreement , and eventual ENPI and EIB funding benefits . #% However , we know from experience that the Council quite often changes it mind during the conciliation procedure , and it seems a great shame that we did not pursue those amendments . #% As Commissioner Vitorino quite rightly said , there are many positive points that we can take on board from this ; and we can build on good practice from one country to another . #% I think it must be underlined that different directives sometimes have different aims . #% Two years ago Parliament voted a series of input targets on development aid to ensure that the large amount of spending that takes place through the regional budget lines was actually held to account and to insist that more be focused on social infrastructure , and in particular on basic health and education policies . #% There is also the Working Time Directive : it seems to me extraordinary that there are still politicians and governments who consider that a level playing field is one in which all EU Member States are equally uncompetitive . #% It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights . #% My constituent Wayne Groves is still in prison after nearly five weeks with no charge and no trial . #% 
in writing . - I am in favour of this report as it deals with some of the current problems which have gone unaddressed by governments . #% On behalf of the party of European Socialists , I support this report and the similar measures that will follow in the other reports this morning and in subsequent weeks and months . #% Mr President , I join with everyone else in congratulating Mr Andersson on the production of an excellent piece of work . #% I therefore call once again on this House to show compassion and non-selective respect for human rights by joining me in supporting my Amendment No 7 calling on the Italian Parliament to honour the commitment by the last government of Italy to put a speedy end to this cruel and anomalous situation , and align its constitution with the right of all EU citizens to move around the Union freely . #% It would be terrible to see companies in 20 years ' time facing prosecutions for things which they did now , which are later judged to have been wrong . #% Abortion should of course be the last resort , but it is my belief that sometimes the teaching and doctrine of the Catholic church and its refusal to countenance family planning have done untold damage to the lives of millions of women in some of the poorest countries of the world . #% From our position , given the measures we take , we do not see any reason at all why we would need to introduce , additionally , whole-herd slaughter of the kind done in some other countries . #% This is another step in the process of peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia and I would hope that we will support those elections to the fullest . #% After all , since most of them have rejected the ghastly communist experiment that so distorted and corrupted their countries for the past 50 years , I hope they would wish to oppose inappropriate intrusion on their national sovereignty and the tide of leftist political correctness that is too often generated by European Union institutions . #% However , it is one thing to require a multinational firm of accountants to comply with this sort of regulation , quite another to require a small firm or one-person business to do so . #% Mr President , in view of the delicate situation in relation to Kaliningrad and the imminent accession of the Baltic States , the Northern Dimension takes on even greater significance . #% To those people I would say : be honest and campaign for what you really believe in , which is your country leaving the European Union , and do not hide behind attacking the Constitution . #% Madam President , in these circumstances , I must put to you a personal question . #% Listening to this debate , where the words ` ramassage ' and ` frontloading ' are being used so often , it seems as though they have become part of the everyday lexicon of our budget language . #% Yet , while many refugees have returned to the country , millions remain in Iran and Pakistan . #% I would also like to thank the staff of the European Parliament who came with us and who did an outstanding job in very difficult circumstances . #% As someone who represents London , including the City of London , I am naturally supportive of financial services liberalisation . #% The first 1 , 000 entrants were given a free meal . #% Mr President , when will Parliament 's Bureau and its Presidency get a grip on the shambolic procedures that we use when it comes to voting ? #% A strong and united voice calling unequivocally for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons is a positive step forward , even if it does not go as far as we would have liked . #% I can not think of a more specific description of chocolate with added milk than to call it milk chocolate . #% I am concerned because they appear to have been detained solely because of the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of speech and assembly , and for no other reason . #% The rapporteur rightly says that red tape must be cut through but is sceptical about the European Union 's ability to do so . #% The text now puts back the review date to 2007 , which gives much more opportunity for practical experience with after-treatment technology to be achieved before stages IIIB and IV are confirmed . #% Mr President , I am rather concerned , and I am sorry I did not have a chance to raise it before Mrs Theato spoke , that a corrigendum has been published to the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% Flexibility and vision is all very well , Mr Alexander , but the Prime Minister 's actions have been successful only in securing the hostility of the countries of central and eastern Europe -- which thought he was their friend -- while gaining not a hint of compromise on CAP reform in discussions with governments . #% The first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the UK will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of CAP subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement . #% That is the position of the committee , which I put forward . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this timely report . #% I was particularly impressed with the emphasis which the rapporteur put on the need to attract young people into the maritime profession and to promote the employment of seafarers . #% In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations , both in the public sector and in the private sector , in the last decade or so . #% Similarly , the proposal will make it easier for companies who wish to second workers within their organization to work in another Member State . #% Mr President , if we can not be respectful in listening to one another , there is hardly any reason to be here . #% As for Lunnon , well that used to be three days on the fast stage coach , and there are many of us folks who never did get used to they newfangled things like horseless carriages and they motorway things that bring all those foreigners to our neck of the woods . #% It is the whole principle that is wrong and that is why UKIP will continue to oppose these deals until that tragic continent gets its fishing grounds back . #% I am not sure how much fun he thinks is associated with debates held at this time of night on this subject . #% I am talking about plasma donation , where you have to travel some distance to fixed machinery and it takes half a day . #% The Commission will now carry out that position . #% It is trying to pretend that it welcomes the outcome because it is largely liberal and concentrates upon the liberal market aspects . #% By the way , for Mr Gollnisch 's information , there are only 30 American personnel in the Macedonian force , and none of them are combat troops . #% Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen , now , thanks to Brussels , struggling to survive , while Spanish fishermen , for example , seem able to flout the rules at will . #% In the US cigarette manufacturers are being forced by the courts to accept financial responsibility for destroying the health and causing the deaths of consumers of their products . #% Often in crisis situations it is women who become the sole providers and they therefore deserve particular recognition and support for this role within our development programmes . #% To do that , we need to give voice to the reasons for Europe in terms of how Europe is relevant to people 's lives and their worries , their hopes and their ambitions . #% This is about equality , not about promoting homosexuality . #% He should also be congratulated because the battle with the Council -- indeed all our rapporteurs ' battles with the Council -- has made that work especially difficult . #% The demise of Matilda , the Australian sheep which disintegrated , serves as an awful warning that this is a very young area of science and experiment and , leaving aside the ethical issues , one that should not be permitted now , simply on the grounds of the potential severe and uncertain impact on human health . #% But in addition - and we see no contradiction in this - we want the development of an EU-based generic pharmaceutical industry as a positive contribution to competition . #% This directive requires Member States to permit or require all or certain companies to adopt fair value , as opposed to historic cost accounting , where it is appropriate to do so and in the manner spelt out in the directive . #% In addition to these two categories of partnerships , where the partners have chosen to be officially registered , there are also a limited number of cohabiting partnerships that are not recognised by any Member State since the people involved have chosen not to seek the legal recognition open to them . #% That is why I am pleased to support Amendment No 10 , which was proposed in committee by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and calls for the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal by June 2002 requiring Member States to supply proof that these plants can operate safely . #% Last , but certainly not least , we urgently need transparency and democratic scrutiny . #% There is another way , of course , and that is to impose exchange controls . #% We see it as a reference point only , not as anything that we will not seek to change when it comes to our committee . #% That is something that should be looked at . #% We are , of course , as others have said , very encouraged by the fact that Heineken , Carlsberg , Levi Strauss and to a certain extent Pepsi Cola , have , as a result of citizen 's pressure , pulled out of that country . #% Certainly the amendments to it by my colleagues Mr de Roo and Mr Lange are moving in the right direction . #% We can look forward to the future with some optimism . #% It was clear that security is the paramount issue . #% The PKK is not interested in a stable , thriving and democratic Turkey oriented to the West . #% It achieves the right balance between allowing police and judicial authorities access to the data on electronic communications , and the protection of privacy . #% Amendment No 69 concerns integrated pest management . #% On data exclusivity , the balance that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has come up with is the right one . #% UNSCOM has destroyed 38 000 chemical weapons munitions , 690 tonnes of chemical weapons agents , 3 000 tonnes of precursor chemicals , 48 Scud missiles and a biological weapons factory designed to produce up to 50 000 litres of anthrax , botulism toxin and other agents . #% We are happy to support this line and trust that they will act accordingly when these measures are considered by the Council . #% The fact is that there are agreed goals in place and we now need all audacious and principled people to get down to working out how we meet the challenges : the challenges presented by the needless deaths of 11 million children under five every year ; how we feed eight hundred million people who still go hungry ; the 2.4 billion who have no adequate sanitation and the six million people we are losing every year to AIDS , TB and malaria . #% 
Mr President , as British Conservatives , we have always opposed the Working Time Directive . #% Many of the deaths from cancer could be avoided by prevention measures , such as access to information and to comprehensive screening programmes . #% I thank Mrs García Arias very much for her report on all these matters . #% But even more significantly , the economic calculation is changing almost daily . #% He is absolutely right that we should look at the best practices available . #% Secondly , I should like to mention Parliament 's budget for communicating with our citizens . #% What are the implications for the Seventh Shipbuilding Aids Directive ? #% My colleagues have wisely decided on that score that they would not push some of the amendments that came before the Committee , although we support and indeed sometimes salute the principles that inspired them . #% One , the Commission should reconsider its antipathy to a more open and effective control of Member States , particularly in regard to the implementation of Community law on public access to documents relating to the infringement procedure . #% Let us land all the fish that are caught , instead of having so many species quotas with the result that a lot of healthy fish are discarded . #% What does it have to hide ? #% It is illogical to be dismissive about people fleeing Iraq or Afghanistan , implying that they are undeserving scroungers , when by common agreement the regimes of those countries are deemed brutal and depressive , and even deserving of military attack . #% So we have covered these key areas , and these are what we should be focusing on in future . #% First , two questions addressed to the Commission . #% When I first brought it to the attention of Parliament , I had no idea that it was going to be the success that it has been . #% The second point is the level of detail provided for each proposed legislative action . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I would like to signal our strong support for the efforts of both the European Commission and the Council to persuade our international partners of the virtues of a broad-based new round of WTO talks , covering a wide range of issues . #% Let us hope that you can say something further at the end of the debate that will reassure me . #% Mr President , politicians are often told of the old actor 's advice that you should never go on stage with children or animals . #% If , as I have been advised , the authors of the original amendment were to propose an oral amendment stating that this new legislative proposal could come forward in four years ' time , then this would avoid such a contradiction . #% Care must therefore be taken to ensure that any weakening of protective state structures does not become an opportunity for radical elements to change the nature of Turkey 's unified and secular democracy . #% They only change their gradings when a disaster is apparent to all . #% We should allow and encourage the market to produce its own solutions , to produce market-led solutions , although I can see that there are merits in encouraging user-owned systems , because looking around the European Union we can see a number of systems which are working well on a user-owned basis . #% Just this week independent European medical specialists have reported than 180 million citizens are exposed regularly to the smoke of others and that twenty-two thousand of them will die as a result this year . #% Let us make sure that we do not undermine either the right to asylum or the visa waiver agreements . #% Can I ask you to inform me when the President will next be in the chair as I wish to put a point of order to her . #% It also affects us because we have all been victims of terrorist activities which have stemmed from the Middle Eastern conflict . #% It is about fundamental freedoms : freedom of information ; freedom of movement ; freedom of expression ; and it is about intolerance . #% Both these organizations are deeply distressed that the Belgian Government report contains malicious lies about their operation . #% Then , briefly with regard to external relations , can we have some read across with regard to external relations , energy and climate change - all of those issues ? #% That is the latest in a month of bloodshed . #% We are concerned that it is minority differences that are stimulated , with little emphasis on integration . #% Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that , at the very least , it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and well-established gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries , which they are perfectly entitled to do . #% The manner in which the new Commission President is chosen will serve as a further way of restoring political faith in Europe . #% More road users will die if Mr de Roo 's amendments are passed . #% Mr President , sometimes it is an advantage to be spokesman for the third group in Parliament because it has provided me with time to read the Commission 's paper . #% I strongly support combating all forms of discrimination . #% If small businesses are driven out of the market because of the proposals from the Commission or if we adopt Mrs Wallis ' amendments tomorrow then it will be consumers who suffer because it will leave them at the mercy of the large global players and it will deprive them of the low prices that they deserve under the new Internet economy . #% The nightmare that should spur our actions is what is happening in former Yugoslavia . #% However , simultaneously , my group has always pointed out that the European Arrest Warrant system would be incomplete without advancing procedural defence rights in Europe . #% I was glad that you indicated to us in committee that you would reconsider this over time . #% It has been non-stop ever since we were elected in 1999 . #% Very large numbers of animals die of natural causes or common ailments . #% All in all , we are failing to fight international organised crime and that is why it is getting stronger . #% It looks as though there are a number of peculiarities to this disease and I would hope that , being still relatively free from it , we can analyse in depth the cases that have arrived in the European Union . #% Parliament has certainly been dragging its feet on this issue , as the MEDA programme and the financial support for the European strategy show . #% Finally , when will we know that like is truly compared with like ? #% With these and the other measures advocated in the report - indeed , in all four reports - we believe that we should do much to achieve better regulation in the EU . #% Instead , it should agree in principle to set up a new convention -- pluralistic , parliamentary and transparent -- with a broader brief than that of Laeken , especially to modernise and refresh Part III , to bring the common policies into line with the aspirations and anxieties of our citizens . #% Mr President , I voted against my party 's whip with regard to the Capoulas Santos report on the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau . #% In the case of the Wolf report on the legal convergence of national central banks and their relation to the ECB , the essential point is to ensure the transparency and democratic accountability of the ECB and its relations with the national banks . #% The most worrying of all is nuclear safety and we know that there are problems in Central and Eastern Europe and possibly elsewhere . #% It can not , therefore , be attributed to the army trying to purge the Tamil Tigers and terrorist combatants . #% One of the things that has struck me particularly during this hearing is the situation between 1990 and 1994 when the BSE crisis was at its height . #% It is pointless to talk about the peace agreement : it is finished . #% Mr President , in recent years fellow Europeans have again been perpetrators and victims of appalling violence and attempts at ethnic extermination , sometimes described , in a euphemism which bewilders me , as `` cleansing '' . #% The three of us from the political parties went out to the hospitals to find out for ourselves , and I think that was what was so important . #% The British Conservatives therefore can not support the measures in this Report . #% The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom . #% It is illustrative of the interdependence between the two and what we have at stake in making this agreement work . #% However , when we do that we will have to balance that scrutiny on behalf of our own taxpayers with acknowledgement of the ACP countries ' right to a say in how money is spent ; we need to be listening , as well as scrutinising . #% If this is the case it makes nonsense of our trying to get better standards for groundwater when the origin of the trouble is still in place . #% Madam President , I have been waiting patiently - or even impatiently - for quite a long time now because I wanted to raise this point before the vote on the Ombudsman . #% Progress is , of course , being made . #% Otherwise arguments of double standards will only add fuel to the fire . #% Tonight , let us hear what proposal is going to be made to follow up the pilot exercises . #% 
Is it not the case now that this proposal , taking away so much from DG Development as it does , is likely to make my prediction come true ? #% This idea has widespread support . #% When I started my political life an elderly gentleman said to me ` always remember that when you put your hand up to vote for expenditure , you are actually putting it down into my pocket ' . #% That is something that all should welcome . #% I think that is a great shame . #% During the Afghan war in the 1980s we in the west supported Islamic militant ideology in order to oppose the spread of communism . #% It is certainly a step forward in the protection of human health . #% I suppose the sunshine policy requires a very sensitive approach to such a strange man who has just rebuffed the South 's special envoy , Mr Lim , who returned empty-handed yesterday from his trip to the North . #% All I would say to Mr Schulz is that , when I sat round the table in Graz and heard the approach of the 25 ministers on the Services Directive , it was most certainly not because they felt that it was a triumph for socialism . #% Mr President , I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that this is a major codecision text in second reading , for which we require a qualified majority to pass amendments . #% Could I just briefly refer to the statement made by the Commissioner on Zimbabwe , which I very much welcome . #% I believe that the report before us is worth supporting . #% Firstly , on political party funding - the matter just raised by Mr van Dam - my Group considers that this funding should be in Parliament 's , not the Commission 's budget . #% Some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform . #% Credit rating agencies were earning fees , from financial institutions , for awarding ratings on their products , and from the resulting business of selling those products . #% In that process two things have been seriously damaged : the tourism policy itself has been damaged , but so too has the reputation of the European Union in general and that of the Commission in particular . #% Food packaging and processing jobs are currently supported by Objective 5a grants . #% Could you please , so as to preserve the interests of the Members of this Parliament , put that question to the Council for an answer ? #% As usual we should make it very clear that we in the Development Committee regard the budget figure that we have here before us , as purely indicative . #% We encourage people to live , work and settle in states other than their own national Member State . #% Local human rights groups believe Dr Jaramillo died because he had evidence that the army and top politicians sponsor paramilitary death squads in Colombia , a belief backed by the findings of Colombia 's own Fiscalía or Prosecutor-General 's Office , and that this was an extrajudicial execution undertaken precisely by them in order to silence him . #% But it should reflect also on why the second reading proposals on our own support through the poverty diseases line were cut back from Parliament 's demands , and why President Prodi announced EUR 60 million of support from the global health fund from the ACP countries , which it was not his right to do and , as we heard in this Chamber from their President-in-Office they oppose . #% Our committee also agreed by a majority to a definition of family that aims to maintain the principle of family unity and to embrace a wide definition of family . #% Although economically it has shrunk , it is a vital source of gas and oil to the EU and has a common enemy in international Islamist terrorism . #% As a parliamentarian , I am rather disappointed that the delegation managed to fit in 75 journalists but could not manage any parliamentarians on the grounds that the delegation was a small one . #% I had the opportunity to visit the Sudan earlier this year , as did Mr Corrie , though not at the same time , and he led an official delegation . #% Secondly , I want to ask for the Commissioner 's assurance that his services will consider sympathetically , in looking at the Phase 2 standards for pedestrian protection , the major contribution that accident avoidance technologies will make in that improvement in reducing pedestrian casualties . #% Thus it will help EU reinsurance undertakings to maintain their competitive edge around the world . #% That , of course , led to the postponement of that meeting , but we have to face this down . #% This year , when health and safety will be defined by working times , scaffolding , chemical agents , carcinogens and , in particular , asbestos - and I am glad the Green Group raised this latter issue - Parliament should feel very proud of the role it has played in promoting the change which is going to be necessary to bring about a ban on asbestos . #% This move is preventing Mr Van Rens operating a tight ship in Thessaloniki itself . #% However , they did not support amendments in two key areas . #% As the chairman of the Hong Kong bar association recently wrote , the rule of law requires that the process of making and repealing law is open , reasoned and in accordance with the law . #% They see land being fought over , medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted , books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world , 50 % of the world 's population never making a telephone call in their whole life . #% We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme . #% That is the challenge confronting us now and it is even more important today than it was this time last year when we debated the first annual report . #% I will not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers . #% This directive is 150 pages long and it has it own share of technical calculations , graphs , charts and other detailed technical provisions . #% Even the ` bullet in the head ' option has been discussed . #% The Motion was called only because of Barroso 's refusal to come clean over hospitality , and the intransigence and blind obedience of the major political groups . #% All four countries are seeking to assert their independence from Moscow while cooperating in varying degrees with the Commonwealth of Independent States . #% I welcome the Court of Justice ruling of 11 July , but we must take this forward . #% Specifically , I hope that the preparations for those elections ensure that they are conducted properly , and that includes allowing more women to stand for election . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , when Denmark joined the EU in 1973 , the EU assumed an Arctic dimension through the Danish dependency of Greenland . #% Any regulations passed by the committee will remain on the statute book even if its powers are suspended , but Parliament can bite if it needs to . #% It is appropriate to give governmental authorities greater cross-border powers to pursue criminals but the use of these powers must be supervised by the European Parliament and the European courts so that civil liberties are entrenched and robustly defended . #% The Commission is therefore quite right to focus on improving the Commission 's representative capacity , especially at the pre-legislative stage . #% So for example , we can agree with paragraph 12 , that immediate and general detention should be avoided . #% This may make for efficient negotiations , but leaves little opportunity for public oversight of the most vital institution in the global trading system . #% It certainly does nothing for the Palestinian cause , as many Palestinians themselves have pointed out . #% I would strongly defend the United Kingdom 's zero rates , particularly in relation to children 's clothes and shoes . #% Mr President , my views on third-country fishing agreements are well known but once again I wish to record my disgust at the fact that the European Union is entering into agreements which , despite the honeyed words , are nothing short of economic imperialism . #% On both occasions , I was absolutely dumbfounded as to what they told us . #% She has repeated that today and I , for one , am delighted to hear her words . #% It is vital to price these different services transparently , so that when people are purchasing they know exactly which service they are buying and which they are not . #% Does the Minister not feel that the mood perhaps changed in Europe after the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands , and that some people in certain countries have a fear of enlarging the European Union and perhaps see that calling a referendum would put a block on any future enlargement ? #% In human resources policy , the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable . #% The Commission was right to take the steps that it did , but that is no long-term solution . #% Firstly , we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA - over 600 since 1977 - but this would be the first federal execution since 1963 . #% Why , as Mr Bourlanges said , is the Council dragging its feet and defying the Treaty of Nice , which requires a semi-automatic passage to codecision as well as qualified majority voting ? #% That is something we should be very proud of . #% Can one conclude therefore that the Commission views Turkey as a candidate country , not a potential candidate country ? #% One of my colleagues mentioned modulation . #% It is true that we need a closer relationship between the EU and the WEU . #% There are countries that have levies , for example , on recording media . #% We need to be clear that the motivating force for this war is primarily about trying to ensure secure access to oil . #% 
It would set a good example to other public administrations . #% I can see people in the gallery already nodding off , and that is why Parliament decided that we should take a bold step to actually phase out the use of HFCs in air conditioning and substitute them with the new developing technology involving CO2 . #% Lastly , the call for all meats to be treated equally under the new rules is also welcome . #% Amongst others , Mr Watson said so , although he himself had previously been rude about Marta Andreasen . #% You may not be aware that there are two representatives of the Burmese military junta taking part in that conference . #% In the West , we should support our American allies ' quest to complete the unfinished business of ridding the world of this extremely evil man . #% While those sales go on there must also be a licensing system world-wide that is fully accountable and fully traceable . #% Now that stands in stark contrast to the revised US Lacey Act adopted in May 2008 , which does enact an explicit prohibition on the import and sale of illegally logged timber , and there is absolutely no good reason why the EU can not emulate this . #% The PES welcomes the full involvement of the European Parliament in this process . #% I urge that this proposal be rejected so that companies , whether in haulage or public transport , can prosper . #% Yes , we must bring truth to these crimes - but do not criminalise what needs to be thoroughly discussed . #% What about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment , victimisation and discrimination ? #% In the majority of cases , the money given to the host structures has been supplemented by larger contributions provided from domestic resources . #% I appeal to this House to support the resolution and for the European Union and the Commission to do everything possible to monitor and to assist in the process . #% If that is what she means to say , then she should apologise . #% We are moving towards electronic voting ; methods of being engaged as an active citizen more and more depend on access . #% I was heartened by the fact that three-quarters of the WTO members could no longer be ignored . #% The rest of the country is effectively abandoned to feuding warlords who monopolise revenues and dispense arbitrary justice in their private prisons , making President Karzai at times little more than the United States-backed mayor of Kabul . #% The one thing they did not give us was the starting point of 150 grammes for that controlled and gradual liberalisation . #% It is the six-year negotiations that are nearing completion to update the 1972 Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention . #% Was it agreed in the area of the third pillar that the emergency brake clause would suppress qualified majority voting and codecision ? #% So we have a double problem there . #% First of all , soft law , as many of my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs have already said , has a propensity to bypass the legislator , to bypass Parliament , to bypass democracy - and that is entirely unacceptable . #% I believe , although it is not my party 's government , that the British Government has been measured and considered in its response . #% I welcome Mrs Souladakis ' report . #% We all need to cooperate if we are to implement its principles . #% It is worth exploring but I would not suggest that it is something we should engage in when seeking to achieve an agreement in Kyoto . #% Certainly anything that promotes labour flexibility , liberates enterprise and reduces burdens on business must be good for the economies of those countries and for employment . #% I witnessed that and I put it on the record now . #% I hope the Commission and Council will pursue these points in their dealings with both countries . #% The fact is the military has a vested interest in the prolongation of the violence , because that enhances its power , its importance and its resources . #% I hope that when the Commission comes back to us in the new Parliament it will take on board and use as a blueprint those questions which are asked in the working document , especially on staffing policies , TAOs , Leonardo and the way in which PHARE and TACIS is operated . #% You certainly seem to be someone who will value the freedoms which this House wishes to have : the freedom of expression , but also the freedoms of looking ahead , of change and reform in Europe , and that this House must change and reform with Europe . #% The problem lies with mechanical breakdown . #% The agri-monetary system is supposed to give some protection against this . #% Clearly , these are four very important reports that we have been discussing on better law-making . #% So I am not proposing an oral amendment . #% Saddam is not just a threat to his own people but to a wider area , including our friends and allies in the Middle East , and potentially our own citizens . #% It is going to be money well spent , because we need to spend it to protect the environment , but it is going to cost them money . #% Indeed the Commission is conducting the only province-wide methodological assessment of physical damage . #% The real question here is : was there any danger to the public ? #% It means that we are a step closer to having proper and rational use of GM technology within Europe . #% Firstly , donor countries look for gratitude of some form for the fact that their national money is going to help in a particular part of the world . #% How is the Commission responding to any criticisms that may be coming up ? #% The whole point of this is that it gives us a right to intervene , a right to be consulted and to be participants in the process of codecision . #% We were promised many things : the new Presidency was going to simplify the burdens on business , reduce red tape and provide leadership to make the EU more relevant to the people . #% Every head of government has publicly supported the principle that the Council should meet in public when it is debating legislative acts . #% Finally , I hope that the PPE-DE Group is solidly behind the Globalisation Adjustment Fund . #% After 11 September , the bombings in Madrid , London and Turkey are a wake-up call . #% Taken together with the other measures that I have mentioned the abolition of frontier controls means that we will now see cabotage systems extended to all transport services by bus or coach operators , including regular services . #% Mr Vermeer has made some worthwhile improvements , but without in any way altering the substance of it . #% I wonder how much you believe that this is a serious prospect ? #% Finally , we reserved the right to make supplementary proposals after the outcome of the interinstitutional discussions which will commence formally in the early months of next year . #% But in others , as the previous speaker has mentioned , national parliaments can be excluded ; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government . #% But is that not what we want overall ? #% He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem . #% However , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has money that has already been allocated to it and that money has come from Member States . #% I think this House would enjoy hearing again what your predecessor gave as a promise some years ago . #% Enlargement will represent a step change in the Northern Dimension . #% Therefore we need to build into the Constitution or Constitutional Treaty an absolute requirement for the three institutions - the European Commission , the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament - to provide cost-benefit impact assessments of the amendments which they propose for legislation . #% It is important that it is spelled out very clearly to us how those competences will operate when set alongside those of national courts . #% Most measures are designed to stop accidents happening , but accidents will inevitably happen and it is in those circumstances that we need eCall . #% We have been involved at Longbridge , where 5000 people were made redundant . #% It is about barriers to movement rather than the conditions of the corpse . #% We should learn from each other as much as possible about how to deal with the security of our people and how best to reduce the tensions which lead to political violence and terrorism . #% Sadly , I have never been there but I feel passionately for the Timorese people suffering since Indonesia ' s annexation in 1975 with almost one third being killed - an even greater proportion of deaths than in the former Yugoslavia . #% 
This statement stressed , apart , of course , from the natural sympathy that we wanted to express , that this had to be tackled by the United States of America and the European Union and many other countries in partnership . #% It is worth mentioning two lines specifically in category 4 : one is the sex tourism line , introduced by Mr Colom , which we need to do something about ; the second is the CFSP for the landmines . #% Madam President , I do not underestimate the importance of health and safety at all , but I must draw the attention of this House to the fact that European Union regulations are undermining personal responsibility and , in many cases , the application of common sense . #% An important change of vocabulary has taken place and Commissioner Pinheiro has used that new vocabulary . #% Otherwise , is this yet another piece of bureaucracy with no real purpose or real difference ? #% The free movement of professionals and the Directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications are among the flagship issues that my committee is most concerned about in the whole construction of the single market . #% Mr President , I should first like to pay tribute to Mr Lange for all the work he has done on what is an extremely technically complex proposal . #% Not all the directives which currently exist promote the aims which we would support together in this Parliament . #% We have also got some special measures for smaller operators , so we have taken very seriously the risk of being disproportionate ; I think we have addressed that very sensibly in the report that we have put before you . #% It was Parliament 's insistence on scrapping the national opt-outs from the directive which led to the stalemate . #% That covers many of the transit and origin countries too . #% I also welcome the increasing role of the UN Taskforce for Sport for Development . #% I also believe that the endorsement given by George Bush to the MDGs represents significant progress -- perhaps the best progress of the week . #% It should address controls for licensed production deals , like that adopted for Austrian Steyr rifles in Malaysia . #% It is grossly unfair and I believe that it is against the letter and the spirit of European law . #% Mr President , I can understand why the Commission has gone along with this solution , because it is a pragmatic one . #% She wrote to you and met you , and you chose to ignore here . #% Millions have fallen victim to a scorched earth struggle between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir 's Arab-dominated regime , and its Janjaweed militias , and ethnic African secessionists in Darfur . #% I would also like to thank Mr Schwab for his very competent report and analysis of the Ombudsman 's report . #% Three priorities have been set for integrating these environmental objectives in energy policy . #% I want them to bring justice to the Muslims , the Uigurs in Xinjiang . #% Mr President , I too welcome what is an extremely necessary and timely initiative by the Commissioner , and I would also like to thank him very much for his cooperation and hard work during his time as Commissioner , which Parliament has appreciated very much . #% When the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection wrote an opinion on Mrs Read 's last report on 12 January 1995 it tried to set out what the conditions of universal service should be . #% And regional funding , just as much as social funding , should respect principles of non-discrimination . #% If that is the case , it may well be that we have to get the message through in each of the EU languages . #% To require all issuers of bonds to issue in their home Member States would have been a retrograde step in creating an integrated capital market . #% Other animals became infected and this delayed the identification of the source of the outbreak . #% Would it be possible for an advance guard of the new Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to set up a planning team with which the European Parliament can have a dialogue ? #% The European Union should now do what it should have done before : consult ports , trade unions and shipping lines from scratch , starting with a blank sheet of paper , and on this proposal it should admit defeat . #% This idea is enthusiastically supported by France and Germany , two countries with higher corporate tax rates , which must be salivating at the idea of getting everybody else 's rates up to their level . #% We need better information in advance , more effort on inspection and supporting whistle-blowers , and greater clarity about people 's rights , so we do not see the exploitation that Mr Cottigny has referred to , which threatens to undercut working conditions and exploits individuals . #% Since fixing the election in March , Mugabe has now deliberately destroyed the homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the poorest Zimbabweans , while millions more continue to rely on international food aid for their survival . #% For a normally sensible British journalist yesterday to say that Europe blindly , on the nod , is about to indulge in its own sinister overreach , really is over the top . #% We know something must be done . #% How can this be justified ? #% But given the fact that there are now electronic means to overwhelm us with lobbying , we need to do something . #% It is simply not acceptable , for example , that there are many programmes dating from the 1980s and 1990s that have still not been closed . #% The Hmong people are living in constant fear of being attacked by Lao soldiers . #% Namibia should be our model if we really want to help the third world . #% But it is not enough for us to have separate programmes and projects , welcome as those may be . #% This report also lays down important markers underlining the importance of the principle of decentralisation ( the ` bottom-up ' approach ) with a view to improving the ` partnership principle ' with local authorities who are often best placed to recognise the needs of citizens across the EU , and especially in Wales . #% In Category 2 , the EUR 27 million entered for the restructuring of the fleet is not going to appear by magic . #% It is estimated that a staggering 10 000 containers are lost at sea each year . #% . Mr President , I wish to join with others in congratulating Louise McVay for a tremendous achievement in bringing this issue this far , and my thanks for excellent cooperation to our rapporteur , Mrs Aaltonen . #% Conditions in Zimbabwe are appalling . #% It will seriously reduce Europe ' s citizens ' choices , thereby reducing their quality of life and standard of living . #% Mr President , I can not think of a worse building in which to hold a debate on climate change . #% We will certainly miss him in that role but , above all else , we will miss him as a good parliamentarian . #% All the various versions of the compromise text during the trialogue processes were discussed in public meetings . #% We take this opportunity to repeat our thanks to the home rule government for the very fruitful discussions on this and other issues that a delegation from the group had with them when it visited Greenland last autumn . #% If it is not too much of a shock for Mr Alexander , I would also like to congratulate the Presidency on its cooperation with the Parliament , which has led to huge progress on some very difficult dossiers , noticeably REACH , the long-running Eurovignette saga , and hopefully data retention . #% It also called on the Commission to permit the use of mercury by the small number of professional companies in the EU that produce traditional barometers . #% We have had the recent condemnation of a terrorist bomber in the United Kingdom , David Copeland , who killed gay people and non-gay people in a gay bar and , of course , we have had the effective sacking of Professor Pelinka from the Observatory by the Austrian Government . #% It is signalled on the voting list and my understanding is that it has the support of the political groups co-signing this resolution . #% In many cases genuine concerns are blown out of proportion as the media indulge in a feeding frenzy , seldom letting the facts get in the way of a good story . #% If there were no agreements -- and I disagree with Mr Farage here -- what happens is that a number of mavericks simply abuse the quantity of fish stocks present . #% Although it now seems that the United Kingdom Government is apparently -- at the last minute -- supporting the amendments for an overall eight-hour limit , I fear that this can only be a cynical PR stunt , since for the last six months it has been wrecking just such an outcome in the Council of Ministers . #% However I have a soft spot for Erasmus because it is very difficult to find fault with that particular programme . #% We must also ensure that if these international transporters do not meet the requirements , they have their licences taken away . #% The latter penalty was even supported by Prime Minister Karzai in a statement made at a press interview in America . #% I look forward to hearing the sound of my neighbour mowing her grass - and indeed my grass too , I hope - knowing that the air will be free from pollution and that the birds will not cough and splutter in the trees around my home . #% We need to challenge the old way of doing things if we want to learn lessons from the current crisis and make it history as soon as possible . #% The common position proposes four years which I think is without precedent in the social area . #% Some of you may be aware that Julius Nyrere spent his spare time translating Shakespeare into Swahili . #% Rates of sickness have increased dramatically . #% Those elections , in all our views , were held on the day in an exemplary fashion . #%
