We should not forget that conflict while our attention is focused elsewhere . #% The courage and the commitment shown in applying Community competition policy is diluted when it comes to the single market . #% This is what worries us . #% We welcome you . #% Whilst I respect the necessity for caution in the nuclear industry as regards safety , I believe it offers a degree of certainty : if we were deprived of this process now , it would be accordingly disastrous for many of my constituents on fixed incomes . #% I am not usually against Member States derogating from European regulations , but if we are going to produce a directive whose specific purpose is to permit a single market across Europe and then introduce specific exemptions into the directive , that would defeat the whole point of having it in the first place . #% We are doing wonderfully well ; others , I fear , are not being nearly as successful . #% We did this in spite of the frankly outrageous comment by Commissioner Palacio at the end of the debate yesterday that ` of course ' she could not accept this amendment as it would be an unreasonable administrative burden ! #% Political oversight is exercised by a House of Commons committee , which has full access to documentation . #% Different problems in different Member States require different national solutions to create the right climate for their businesses to create jobs . #% She deserves all our thanks . #% It has not advanced a political solution , but retarded it . #% Mr President , on a point of order . #% I certainly do not know , because I do not have the technical expertise , whether the range of recovered vegetable oils which are now seen to be a source of risk should be subject to an outright ban , or whether it should simply be limited to some section of kitchen waste which should never have been in any form of animal foodstuff in the first instance . #% I welcome his announcement that elections can take place by 9 January , but I share the Commissioner 's apprehension and beg the question : in the light of what has gone on and the present emergency measures - the suspension of certain television channels and other human rights - are free and fair elections possible in less than eight weeks ' time ? #% Saddam clearly feels - wrongly - that he is being let off the hook . #% On the other two issues of the financial perspectives and the budgetary procedure , it really is a step too far . #% The reality is that the heroic efforts of government officials , veterinarians , farmers , police , the military and many others brought the disease under control more quickly than the smaller outbreak in the UK which occurred in 1966-68 . #% If you look at the biggest players in the financial services sector they have based their strategic decisions over the past few years on the assumption that EMU will indeed go ahead . #% The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation . #% The truth is that they want money . #% It is not a satisfactory situation , where aggrieved policyholders are referred by the host state authority to the home state authority and are then sent back by the home to the host authority , thus to find themselves unable to have their case examined by either . #% Indeed , it is the proposal to use satellite technology which irks me most . #% In those circumstances , with regret , but nevertheless assuming responsibility , the Commission - in the person of myself , who has the portfolio responsibility for personnel - had to act . #% Other measures of particular note are the proposals to create an SO2 emission control area in the North Sea . #% In my own north-west constituency , we are determined to promote equality and sustainable development wherever possible . #% You probably would not talk about it much in a referendum on the Constitution -- if you had one -- but it is vitally important . #% While these obstacles can not be compared to the Wall , they are still a barrier to the free communication and wider horizons that promote understanding and tolerance . #% Mr President , the co-rapporteur , Mr De Rossa , talked about the need for a ` decent society ' . #% Well , if that is the case , then something is clearly very wrong , and I suspect it is not wrong with Denmark . #% There should be no place in Britain - and , I suggest , anywhere in Europe - for Sharia law . #% I , like many others tomorrow , will vote for this report and the bulk of the amendments , knowing that by going forward to the second reading we are taking steps in the long process of developing an environment policy for the European Union which will outlast all the presidencies and all the ministers that this Parliament will see , and which will probably also outlast most of the Members of this House . #% We are particularly concerned in relation to this report at the restrictions of the rights of labour activists to organise free trade unions . #% Madam President , last Friday I too met with farmers in my constituencies . #% I share many of her criticisms and frustrations about the scope , implementation and speed of change to Regulation 1408/71 . #% We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children 's dimension . #% In sum , this is a terror state . #% We should praise our colleagues in the Swedish Presidency who have stood by those countries and who have ensured concerted action by the European Union in response and ask them to continue it . #% However , from her reply it seems that somehow , even if it is a counter-compensation , measures that might be technical in nature , though not technical measures that reduce efficiency , could and therefore do have an effect on effort , and would actually then be seen as contributing towards MAGP targets . #% The European Union has set up the unique Euro-Mediterranean Partnership : quieter , in-depth work , helping to establish the rule of law and rights-based legislation in North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean . #% The committee also rejected the Greens ' view as expressed in their amendment today , that the price stability mandate should be altered to take account of the difficulties faced by manufacturers alone if their prices fall . #% If the European Union is to move closer to the citizen , we have to make it much more of a common market for people than it is at the moment . #% UK Conservatives believe that in prima facie cases of discrimination and under the British legal system it must remain up to the plaintiff to supply conclusive evidence of such cases of discrimination . #% We believe that in the UK consumers have paid too much for their cars for too long and this Parliament should not postpone the cheaper car prices which will be the result of a more competitive market . #% We send a clear message to the drugs companies in this resolution : prices are too high and legislative action , including compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency , is needed to deal with it . #% At the same time we have to create a whole process for awareness-raising amongst communities and individuals who feel that they themselves are not under threat or will not be affected by AIDS and HIV . #% It just seems to be an exercise of taking money out of the system because that is the thing to do to please the Member States . #% The tariff for Thai cooked chicken meat is one seventh of that on frozen fresh chicken . #% Mr President , I wish to thank our rapporteur , Mr Fantuzzi , for the very good work he has done on his report , examining and revising the legislation on the protection and designation of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs . #% As we know , markets cross borders . #% This has led to the longest period of sustained economic growth in living memory in the UK . #% Mr President , a year ago everyone here said that the Constitution would need unanimity . #% The cost of having to maintain parliamentary operations in both Strasbourg and Brussels has now become indefensible , and we will continue to campaign to have Parliament sit only in Brussels in future . #% Thank you for addressing us so clearly . #% Secondly , in Russian Daghestan we have once again seen the brutal action of Chechen guerrillas who beheaded the border guard commander and took hostages including local hospital workers . #% Firstly , it is very important that the Commission comes forward with a robust cost-optimal methodology for renovation . #% Mr President , the first EC-Israel Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1975 and for 20 years the location of exported products was never questioned . #% It arises from an amendment to our Rules tabled by just two Members of the European Parliament - Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering - who considered that this would facilitate the participation of Members of Parliament from across 27 Member States - as we will be in January - in positions of responsibility in Parliament . #% The principle of openness means that public bodies should take decisions as openly as possible and is now defined in the public access regulation . #% Large amounts of CAP funds are already available to EU farmers . #% Has the Council considered this ? #% Mr Wolfowitz wanted to clean it up and now he will not be able to , but it is an ill wind that can not be used by the European Union to its advantage . #% He played an important role in our deliberations , counselling moderation when others wanted to move too far and too fast , resisting cheap easy stereotyping of those we were investigating and imposing fact in preference to fantasy . #% I shall summarise at this juncture in response to the precise points that Mr Hyland raised . #% So , hang on , President Klaus ; if they do not give you what you want , do not sign the thing . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , tonight , we in the Socialist and Democrat Group give our full support to this European Parliament demand that Liu Xiaobo is allowed to go to Oslo , and does not earn a different prize as the first laureate or laureate 's representative in its one hundred year history to be unable to be present to receive the Nobel Peace Prize . #% 
The way people get their information today is through television . #% For instance , automatic mandatory mobility for senior management and for people in money-handling , contract-handling posts will in itself provide a safeguard against a repetition of the double accounting that we have detected in Eurostat . #% The 2004 budget will be far from easy for a variety of reasons , firstly because it is in the ABB - activity-based budgeting - format . #% We in Parliament need to sort out these details . #% Dementia is expected to be one of the main challenges for healthcare in the coming years and cooperation between countries to improve prevention , diagnosis and care is vital . #% The first thing I would say to him - and I hope he accepts it in the spirit in which it is said - is that it is not really the Court of Auditors ' responsibility to challenge the Fontainebleau Agreement on the United Kingdom budgetary rebate . #% Instead of joining America , Britain , Spain , Bulgaria and so many other countries in a display of solidarity and determination , the government of one particular EU Member State has gone to quite extraordinary lengths to protect Saddam Hussein 's regime from the consequences of its activities and to derail the efforts of the international coalition against Saddam . #% I believe that this Parliament has conducted itself with dignity . #% We must seek responsible and sustainable fisheries everywhere . #% I welcome the fact that there is now going to be a smoking rather than a non-smoking zone . #% However , as everybody knows , the Euratom funds are not subject to proper transparency and accountability . #% The Commission response to date has been to say that Europe simply has to move up the value-added chain ; we simply have to diversify into higher-skilled , more specialised work . #% We must respect the civil liberties of our citizens , and we do , but equally , we must not allow those who operate across our borders to abuse civil liberties to promote their crimes . #% Then , of course , women 's rights . #% However , as he also knows , I am not at all happy with certain elements of his report . #% Mr President , the attacks on New York and Washington were a new form of terrorism on a new scale , amounting to an act of war . #% They are telling fibs and trying to stir up the Eurosceptism that is latent in much of the British press and in parts of public opinion to their electoral advantage . #% It is time that we did something on detergents as there is a major problem associated with detergents and their impact upon water quality across Europe . #% There are European names in the US disclosures , and it would be an altogether healthy thing for EU central banks to follow suit with similar disclosure about support during 2008 and 2009 as an accompaniment to the new stress tests . #% We in the EU have already proved this with our four freedoms of movement of people , goods , services and capital . #% They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive - far from fighting terrorism , it is a sure-fire way to fuel terrorism . #% This is a very good deal in many ways and a lot of what has been agreed is a good step forward for pedestrians ' safety . #% This is about transparency and making sure that everyone understands it . #% I am sure there is merit in the idea of harmonising sanctions , but these need to be very powerful measures and certainly must not weaken Member States ' existing legislation . #% Eurojust is not the way forward and is unnecessary if cooperation is improved following the Kirkhope report . #% Madam President , following a point of order made by Mr Corbett , entirely correctly referring to the Rules on this , I should like to draw to the attention of the House that on the previous vote of the Bowe report , if everybody in this House who had an interest in pharmaceutical companies through shareholdings had declared an interest , we probably would not have arrived at the majority required . #% The tourism industry is important for the future of all EU Member States ' economies and it is vital that the EU focuses its attention on tourism 's future . #% As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors . #% So welcome to Romania and Bulgaria ; let us welcome their politicians onto the EU gravy train . #% With those few opening remarks , let me thank not only the Commission in general but also the individual Commissioners who are going to contribute to this debate . #% Perhaps the screens could have given us better information about what was coming ? #% I would like to be clear that we were voting on the PPE-DE amendment , then we will be happy on our side of the House and I think on the other side as well . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteur and her staff . #% An important precedent was set in Uzbekistan following the Andijan massacre , but the fact that the reaction took four months is a sad commentary on the lack of seriousness given to the clauses in the past . #% Unless we suppose that the consumer is benefiting , I believe it is worth noting that the anti-dumping duties are not likely to lead to increased consumer prices , but to decrease the profit margins of the importers . #% Second , I hope the House will send a strong message to the United States that the Mexico City Policy is unacceptable and should be abandoned . #% This much prized social model seems to consist of 40 % youth unemployment , welfare dependency and the break-up of the traditional family . #% Mr President , I am also just back from the Jenin visit and I share the distress of breaches of human rights law by both sides . #% But it was Mrs Villiers ' own group which held out against an obligation on lawyers to report suspicious transactions and therefore held up the final resolution of this matter for six months after our plenary vote in April . #% However , it is important that we are not passive in relations with Turkey . #% However , in the long term this is not the way to deal with the problems facing the industry today . #% It should desist now , and this assembly should reject this directive . #% It affects young lesbians and gay men - teachers , public officials - and could be used to prevent young people having access to any material - films , books , plays , works of art - created by a gay man or a lesbian . #% On the essential reporting needed , using the OECD Development Assistance Committee methodology to enable us to achieve this poverty focus , we have more concern over whether this is achieved for Asia and Latin America as against our aid for the ACP countries . #% If we do not avoid extremist responses , we may feed the very beast we seek to destroy . #% This report itself contributed to increasing that poor image . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for the inclusive approach she has given all the other groups during first and second reading and secondly congratulate her on the way she represented Parliament during conciliation , particularly when dealing with some of our friends in the German Green Group , a difficult task at the best of times as I am sure Chancellor Schroeder has found out and will continue to find out . #% One of the problems is that the debate is concentrating on what we have voted in committee already and what we may well vote in plenary on Thursday . #% Shame on the pharmaceutical companies , who pretend to cut the cost of essential medicines when speaking to us in Europe but who fail to deliver in sub-Saharan Africa where the need is greatest . #% However , because it is politically convenient , many people have forgotten that Bessarabia was illegally invaded by Stalin with the complicity of Hitler . #% Thirdly , the EB established a clear and future dialogue with the present board of the ECB . #% Not at all , when you consider that planning applications and projects are no longer discussed with the people that they affect . #% Mr President , this is a debate which is bedevilled with hypocrisy . #% We in our political group , as Mr Ferber has indicated , feel we have had more successes than failures in this budget process . #% These arguments will move with the science . #% Although the United Kingdom has the highest incidence of BSE , it also has the most comprehensive control measures . #% There is a danger that no agreement will be reached at all . #% I hope that this House will join with me in condemning any government that prevents the national parliament having a debate on what is of course an absolutely crucial issue for the citizens of the European Union . #% Old copyright rules can not simply be applied on the new Internet for example . #% Thus , as always , the Commission is looking for a European problem that does not exist on a European level and then failing to address it . #% I want to concentrate on process - that is what concerns me - and Parliament 's right to contribute properly to the new action plan . #% How he manages the challenges to law and order in Gaza , particularly as settlers step up their violent efforts to prevent eviction from the West Bank , will set the tone for the talks we hope will materialise after these elections . #% It is not simply a question of finding a single candidate . #% Nine days later the officials responsible reported this decision to the teachers themselves at a general assembly in Brussels . #% All we need to do is provide factual information and I am confident we will win the battle of ratification . #% The rapporteur 's reports have been a genuine attempt to improve that proposal . #% 
Secondly , all Member States need to consider adopting national annual targets for improving a certain percentage of their existing buildings . #% She will not be surprised if I say to her again that in November she will have the opportunity to announce her intention to do so , in the communication winding up the European Year of Disabled People . #% If we really had achieved that , then we should be proud of it . #% We must focus on getting the facts across because the facts speak for themselves . #% The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has quite simply voted for the maintenance of the Commission 's proposed spending on consumer protection , not the deep cuts proposed by the Council . #% I ask the Commission to assist the refugees who have already fled and are in situ elsewhere . #% Let us now take up the challenge and join , in every way we can , in the restoration of Iraq 's rich culture and human diversity and her return into the family of nations , through the establishment of a free and democratic state . #% The second links in with a debate we will be having later this week on the code of administrative behaviour : how do you see that as an integral part of the overall reforms ? #% They are also trying to whip up consumers to take part in their campaign . #% I ask them to reconsider . #% However , if it were to be proposed to provide funds for ( say ) our steelworkers from Corus , we could not oppose such a contribution . #% We welcome the reaffirmation of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention , and credit is due to the Finnish presidency for this point . #% As has already been said , this is supposed to be part of the common immigration policy of the European Union , dealing with the pull factor of possible work , often within the informal economy and amongst vulnerable and non-organised workers . #% The European Council should , and probably will , suspend the ratification process but it should not pull the plug on the whole constitutional project . #% There does seem to be an increase in the numbers and an increase in the numbers seems to indicate , and I underline ` seems ' , that there is an easier or a quicker granting by judges of this possibility . #% Mr President , I have listened very carefully to the debate so far and I was very interested in what Mr Stercks and Mr Lannoye said . #% There are over 1 , 300 , 000 postal workers in the public postal services in the European Union and they deserve to be treated with the fairness and dignity due to people who carry out such a vital public service . #% Another key issue is Amendment 4 , to which many other speakers have referred . #% What the car industry is short of is not bleeding hearts ; it needs more profits to invest in those new products . #% Would it be possible to bring forward proposals such as that ? #% We have proposed that if either the Council by a qualified majority , or Parliament by a majority of its Members - in other words , not a narrow majority on a Thursday afternoon of 29 to 36 - decides to call back an implementing measure , then the Commission must either withdraw the measure , or their original measure will be subject to the full legislative procedure under codecision to confirm , amend or repeal the act in question . #% Proper enforcement , as is always the case with all legislation , is essential ; and elements to achieve that are distinct from but obviously associated with standard setting . #% What are we going to do about that ? #% However , the USA is certainly the big project that we all know about . #% In the past , I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the draftsman for the consensus that they have drawn together . #% The only minor problem we encountered , which reflected the large turnout of enthusiasm to participate in the election , was slight overcrowding in some polling stations . #% As Mrs André-Léonard has said , some battles have been won . #% Transport is the fastest-growing source of global warming gases in Europe . #% We have all called for President Milosovic to line up clearly behind the necessary political process . #% Some years ago , the Commission in its McDougal report concluded that central tax-raising powers of at least 7 % of GDP would be needed to allow counter-cyclical spending and transfer payments to make a single-currency zone function properly . #% We had conversations with Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat and other very senior people there . #% As we examine the environmental consequences and challenges of enlargement , we will not seek to enforce on those states which seek to join us in the applicant process the same kind of environmentally disastrous projects which we have often adopted in our own ignorance inside the Union over the last 40 years . #% To come out and say that you are HIV positive and to deal with the discrimination and the anger that you therefore suffer is to declare yourself a warrior : a warrior because you fight the battles that you never want another generation to have to fight again . #% I need to give warning now that , if those two amendments are carried , I , as Chairman of the Budgets Committee , would consider that to be a breach of Rule 63a . #% We have all sat through long and involved negotiations with the Council and the Commission , and I am pleased that we have come to a satisfactory conclusion - at least in most respects . #% Without the help of MEPs and their staff , and I note with appreciation the support from my colleagues across the floor , we could not have reached a fast-track agreement at first reading . #% If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave , women are punished in their earnings for having children . #% I congratulate her on her patience during the prolonged conciliation proceedings . #% Due to the language of the oral amendment which is ambiguous , British Conservatives were not able to accept this report in its entirety . #% I was particularly pleased that the new British Labour Foreign Secretary , Robin Cook , when he spoke for the very first time , talked about the abuse of human rights and the need to do something about that . #% Miss Morgan now continues this particular inheritance by asking for a depolitisation of the discharge process . #% I would also like to thank the governments , academics , practitioners and NGOs - not least from the developing countries themselves - for their contributions . #% Our own credit rating agency paid for by us , guaranteed to dance to our tune . #% A number of irregularities were apparent in the first trial . #% With respect , do you feel that is satisfactory or do you feel that the public will find that satisfactory , because these are problems that are recurring ? #% Equally , we need to do everything we can , as mirrored in Amendment 4 , to help the ordinary people of Sri Lanka , who have suffered for so long and need a peaceful solution . #% Linking external and internal policies is not aided by India 's infrastructure , which displays characteristics of a developing nation while seats of enterprise dominate the skylines of Mumbai and Bangalore . #% The report welcomes the fact the ECB does not interpret its responsibility for stability policy one-sidedly , but that , in addition to inflation , it also monitors deflationary tendencies . #% I somewhat regret that the Commission did not say anything about encouraging the Turkish Government to go down this route : not only of social and economic progress , which clearly is needed , not only of the recognition of linguistic and cultural rights , but of actually talking about political dialogue and a political solution in the Kurdish region in south-east Turkey in the construction of the Turkish State . #% According to our agenda , after 9 p.m. tomorrow evening we are due to debate whether to grant a cent to the Energy Community Treaty and put an oral question to the Council with regard to this Treaty . #% However , today we have heard of the presidency 's enthusiasm for developing European defence . #% The fact that we now embrace all hard woods in this particular directive is a sensible start . #% On a day when terror has struck on our own continent , in Spain , and our hearts are with the people of Spain , we need to find room in our hearts for the people of Haiti too and to lend them our support and help them to have justice . #% Lastly , on the point raised by Mr Swoboda , it is critically important that we set out a strategy for a ` new neighbours ' initiative and that Copenhagen should provide a mechanism whereby we can really come to terms with those countries which could be potential candidates . #% I am saddened by some of the contributions this afternoon . #% You have mentioned the Peace-building Commission -- which is very important -- and peace-making , peace-keeping and peace-building . #% I would like to express my strong support for the report . #% However , I do not want to go over old ground that Members have already covered in this debate . #% Finally , there are some TDI amendments with this . #% As a lasting memorial to his work , I should like to see the Council now , in recognition of the work he has done , agree to the changes in the statutes for the second generation agencies - changes on the own-resources question , changes on financial control and changes on discharge that will allow Parliament to carry out its responsibilities properly . #% We must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market . #% It seemed to me that , at the very least , we required a full impact assessment from the Commission before agreeing to this . #% In yesterday 's I saw that one of Mr Putin 's advisers , whom we have heard from before , is still telling us that it is all a myth and global warming will be a good thing ! #% It is right that it should be the Bureau : its members are elected by the House as a whole , it deals with the detailed administrative and political decisions and hears members of the parties concerned when there is a controversial decision to be taken . #% Such a set of amendments may relate to different parts of the original text . #% 
This question has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the question on the order paper . #% The idea that in all circumstances the fact that you have a lawyer sitting by you guarantees you the normal minimum of consumer protection does not seem to be a satisfactory point to raise . #% When we had our debate in the hearing with the Commissioner about a month or so ago , my committee , the Committee on the Environment , was really rather in two minds as to whether it wanted to see emissions trading measures put forward , but it is worth our while to explore that line . #% Sunlight should never have been included in the directive . #% We have it in our power to reunite Europe and to create a genuinely Europe-wide Union dedicated to building stability and prosperity , not only for its own citizens , but also beyond its borders . #% And , finally , we have to ensure that the switchover from analogue to digital is attractive to all of our citizens : that is the end which we should work to achieve . #% Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating my good friend and colleague Mr Donnelly on an excellent report which covers most aspects of the problems associated with the millennium bug . #% In the March 1997 trialogue agreement the teachers showed their willingness to collaborate in return for a promise by the Commission to maintain their contracts until retirement . #% Mr President , this afternoon you mentioned International Women 's Day . #% This will make it easier for citizens to see and to understand what our Union is about . #% By giving UK businesses the confidence to reach into these markets , this measure will help in this task and increase trade , growth and employment across both the north-west and all of Britain . #% He did not put it quite as firmly this time . #% I also agree that we have to be sensitive to the needs of the countries involved and not adopt dogmatic solutions . #% Commissioner , all I say to you is that British farmers , the European Union and agriculture are suffering as a result of indecision . #% The building is a monument to how humankind has ignored the imperatives of climate change . #% It is quite clear to all of us that the whole world of electronic communications is presenting us with a regulatory challenge , but it is clearly presenting you , Commissioner , and the competition authority with unprecedented challenges , given the speed with which technology is advancing . #% I want to hear from Commissioner Byrne that he will be the defender of everything that was implied in Article 152 once it is added to the Treaty . #% We are failing singularly to do that . #% There is real concern for those in the transmission and distribution businesses that their business is likely to be transferred to Arriva . #% I hope we can say to new Member States ` there are no second-class citizens in Europe ' and to old Member States ` it is time to open your borders and open your minds ' . #% in writing . - I supported today 's report calling for a joint register of lobbyists and interest groups to be set up . #% It is essential that the common foreign and security policy starts to have some teeth and starts to take effective action . #% However , we have to keep particular lines in focus . #% Globalisation has bred insecurity among our citizens , causing some to doubt the European project and to embrace protectionism and isolationism . #% To do anything else would be to raise unreasonable expectations both in the candidate countries and among the peoples of the European Union . #% At the summit meeting with Russia , it will need reminding of its obligations in Chechnya and must be made to understand that it must respect the sovereignty of its former satellites such as Ukraine . #% We have demonstrated that by petitioning citizens can get an item debated on the floor of the European Parliament and that the Commission will come to Parliament , as indeed it came to the Petitions Committee . #% All of us who have travelled with our families to camp-sites know how much we take on trust in those sites , sometimes with tragic results . #% I put the point that the containment by Russia of arms flows from Russia would be a very welcome step forward in terms of shared efforts to combat terrorism . #% In requiring response to claims , the German text uses the word `` unverzüglich '' , which means `` without delay '' , whereas the English text uses the word `` immediately '' . #% Even if that were true - and I would not expect to see such a puerile argument - the fact must be that two wrongs do not make a right . #% Fourthly , I come to what we might be able to do in the present context . #% It follows that the European Constitution is also irrelevant , as well as dead ! #% It did not reject all the amendments , only those that asked it to take follow-up action , something that is particularly important . #% I want local economic development to be first in line when European programmes are planned , managed and implemented . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Maij-Weggen for her comments . #% That is even true for countries that have not indicated that they wish to go to stage 3 of economic and monetary union . #% If you do not , we will pursue this agenda until human rights are totally and finally respected . #% Madam President , we are debating the last annual report which will be presented to the Parliament by Jacob Söderman . #% I appreciate your point , Mr President . #% We were the first Western elected politicians to visit the royal household since the crisis . #% As far as the final decision in the College is concerned , that too is dependent on the satisfactory outcome of negotiations ; and I have specified the fundamental considerations there . #% It is action not words that is needed . #% I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved - the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency - for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations , as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted - well , sometimes anyway . #% However , what others have said here today , that we must take stock of what happened , is equally important . #% At the European level we have a certain confusion of objectives . #% Where policies are perceived as unfair and inconsistent , as in the UK , then protests will enjoy widespread popular support . #% There is ample evidence that these people harmed the Iraqi people when the Iraqi army refused to carry out the killings that Saddam Hussein required . #% My committee has proposed 100 % restoration of these three budget lines to the level of the provisional draft budget . #% Perhaps more significantly , reserves of natural gas have now been discovered in the Bay of Bengal . #% Some will call for dialogue , wanting to point out their concerns and encourage the regime to change its ways . #% Unfortunately , many of Zimbabwe 's neighbours not only have encouraged the Mugabe regime , but also have allowed Mugabe to dictate the terms of Africa 's relationship with us . #% While I thank the Commissioner for his reply , perhaps he would tell us how many formal complaints he has received in recent weeks from within the diamond sector about the supplier of Trisystem ? #% In 1918 , death was the firewall that put an end to it ; the virus ran out of victims . #% Flung San Suu Kyi remains imprisoned in her home in Burma . #% On these we have distinct policies which are well known and differ from those of the majority of this Parliament . #% It seems to us essential that if we are going to give renewable energies the breathing space and the momentum that they merit , it is right to try and aim for a level playing field . #% In spite of the decision that the UK Government has taken on Britain not joining the single currency in the first phase I think that the vast majority of people in this House recognise that it is the determination of the new government and of the presidency to safely and securely bring about the final phase of the EMU . #% Private vehicles will possibly be next . #% Eleven small companies have benefited or become eligible to benefit from South Essex since 1994 . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the upheaval in Tunisia is undoubtedly a reflection of people 's frustration at the country 's political stagnation and its relative economic stagnation . #% This has been carried out because they do not want consumers to know about it . #% This would be rather more useful than my trying to make a recitation in the limited time available in this House . #% In the European Union we have already had mutual recognition of driving licences for some time now . #% Tomorrow our votes for Mr Cabrol 's brave and accurate report , for the common position without amendment , will literally bring a breath of fresh air for future generations of European citizens . #% The international tribunal is in danger of being written off as a sop to the conscience of the very international community which stood weakly by while the horrors went on . #% 
It beggars belief that , as we approach the revision of the first railway package , a number of states - including so-called influential states , including states that like to inform us of their pro-European credentials - have failed to enact this significant piece of European legislation . #% Yet the UK pays GBP 45 million a day into this corrupt institution . #% After nine years she has only provided information sufficient to close three files . #% This is a small but serious point : the notebook from the Session News Unit refers to important debates on economic and monetary union last evening . #% I confess to having no such absolute certainties . #% It is important that they are able to participate in voluntary work abroad , school exchanges and learning languages . #% As I said in my question and as you have commented , many thousands of ordinary Iraqis out of the sight of the media are kidnapped every day . #% We are talking in the main about countries from Central and Eastern Europe which have enjoyed , as we all know , 40 years of dictatorship when civil society was emasculated , driven underground and destroyed . #% As many of you know , I was Parliament 's rapporteur on that issue . #% The central eastern-European countries will have problems co-financing SAPARD because they will have to incorporate budget resources which they had set aside for 2000-2001 into their budgets for 2002-2003 . #% Drivers say that they will lose GBP 80 per week . #% Romania is European in every sense ; its mere name gives that away . #% Yet virtually everything that comes through is stamped as being fully compatible , even though it is obviously not . #% No member of the Security Council should prejudge that debate ; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence . #% People like me will continue to eat it , but we want people to have the widest choice of all the products which will expand the import of cocoa and added vegetable fats into the European Union . #% This should be central to this network - a network of judicial personnel is one thing , but a network that really provides cross-border access to justice would be the best way to recognise progress towards a real area of justice in Europe for our citizens , and this on the day of the annual debate on that subject . #% Nothing in any of our votes should be taken to mean that we support an increase in the overall EU budget . #% I wish it were not so and I look forward to the day when it will not be so . #% We are against capital punishment and we hope that the sentences of death imposed on certain people at the present time will be commuted . #% Mr Harbour 's question about children of stable partnerships is absolutely vital . #% This resolution is really an appeal for clemency . #% We are proposing that the by 2010 industrialized countries should cut their greenhouse gases by 15 % as compared with 1990 . #% We have seen it for ourselves , and the research is there . #% More importantly , how can democracy prevail when non-elected NGOs enjoy more privileged access to the key players than democratically elected representatives ? #% This year , we sponsored a new resolution on the ground that we have to have a resolution : we have no dialogue ; we fail to recognise that we have no dialogue because we had a resolution . #% He is certainly treated far worse than either the American or British spies who were sentenced for selling their secrets to the Soviet Union . #% I looked at the lorry he was sitting on and I thought : that is another one we do not have ' . #% It involves freedom of the press in Russia and further outrages are expected over the next two or three days . #% Would he join with me in calling on all EU institutions to abide by the spirit of the Amsterdam draft Treaty on anti-discrimination on ageism ? #% A passing parade of political nonentities have given themselves the power to grant rights and freedoms to other people . #% There are over one million such injuries across the EU every year . #% Madam President , I hope you will not rule me out of order , but I have a very specific question to the Commissioner on research . #% The most effective method of controlling these tumours is high-dose-rate brachytherapy , which minimises exposure to radiation of healthy organs and tissues during radiation treatment of malignant growth . #% If you look back through history , you find that mature democracies do not go to war with each other . #% Consequently , we have abstained on the final vote . #% It can also damage vegetation , reduce crop yields and stunt the growth of forests and , like acid rain , it can eat into and destroy the fabric of buildings and works of art . #% I would suggest that Mr Sterckx partly repay that obligation by ceasing to attempt to destroy Britain 's economy and Britain as a nation state . #% I trust that we will vote in accordance with that in the Karas report at noon today . #% I want them to listen to the voice of Miss Fen Yang , arrested when visiting friends and sentenced without trial to two years in a female labour camp , where she is abused and brainwashed . #% The second item is the very small item of EUR 37 000 , which relates to the creation of an A7 post in the Commission office in Washington . #% The proposal before us is a first step in ensuring that the travelling public are protected when transport operators fail to live up to their promises and obligations . #% A Parliament should have a budget that reflects its political priorities . #% The single market is fundamental to the very existence of the European Union and the illegal action by France throws the whole single market into disrepute . #% One last comment . #% As regards OLAF , the committee deliberately did not deal with this because the matter was sub judice . #% I would wish , on behalf of my group , to underline his point that we can not think the WTO is a good body when it finds in our favour and a bad body when it finds against us . #% By the way , Mr President , I am sure you would be interested in this , it would avoid us having the problems in this House of having full Members for one session only just prior to the European Elections . #% I want to turn to the Global Health Fund which we have a budget line and a relatively small amount of money for next year . #% We would like to be reassured that we can have the observation and control , which is part of our mandate . #% I wonder whether the critics of this report have ever worked on construction sites as many of us have . #% After all , when USD 1.6 billion was raised for relief in Iraq it was largely at the expense of Africa . #% I wondered whether the Minister would like to make any comment on the possibility of British Conservative MEPs sitting on the same bench as Mrs Mussolini ? #% I hope the Commissioner will press on with the negotiations with what he called the organisations syndicales . #% I put it to you that there is concern . #% Also , measures to combat crime and terrorism must have due regard to respect for human rights , including the right to a fair trial . #% We can not enforce international law by breaking international law . #% Mr President , on behalf of all my colleagues I would like very much to welcome Mr Kinnock here to discuss the reforms . #% When Jody Williams spoke in Ottawa , she talked about superpowers and she referred to the general public - civil society - as a superpower , because it was the work of millions of people throughout Europe and the rest of the world that brought pressure to bear and brought the result that we are all congratulating ourselves on . #% This is where the EU ' s emphasis should be as Mr Patten has indicated . #% There is indeed a problem . #% A third amendment which I have tabled has changed just one word in the English language version from `` regrets '' to `` notes '' . #% We also need to understand that NATO and the EU need to work closer together , by bringing together the non-military tools at the EU 's disposal , combined with the decisive military capabilities available to NATO . #% I support these calls , along with further calls to simplify the procedures relating to this funding , in particular for SMEs , which we should be assisting in the current economic climate by reducing the administrative burden placed upon them . #% This Group and Parliament will play a full part in fostering such a convention . #% Is it a lack of political will ? #% Would you agree that it would be a good idea for that to be implemented at European level ? #% 
I still cherish the hope that on Wednesday they will vote with us in the interests both of employment and employees . #% At least 50 % of these acts of violence are carried out by the victim 's husband or partner . #% Finally , my committee welcomes the introduction of alternative dispute resolution procedures and hopes that this regulation can enter into force as soon as possible . #% In conclusion we very much look forward to hearing your responses this evening and also your reassurance that the reforms are proceeding to plan as you would wish . #% It was clear last year ! #% So I plead with everybody , now there is a smoking area , to use it and not the no-smoking areas , including the corridors and going up to the lift . #% And it is also common knowledge that General Motors and the European institutions have a special relationship . #% I listened carefully to what Mr Watson and Mr Schmitt just said . #% I would simply say to him that I agree with his forecast for future structures and the practices that he anticipates , and express confidence that they will come to pass . #% He understood from his own practical experience the importance of access to networks and services . #% That is not democracy ! #% They can be helped in any country . #% I want people to have access to objective information about medicines and treatment . #% However , the matter can not rest here . #% My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here ? #% Is it not true that the guidelines are really too weak to shut the door to impunity arrangements ? #% In a constituency where we have lost 10 000 shipbuilding jobs in the last ten years , I welcome the measures that you have outlined tonight but hope that we can move faster and further in the coming months . #% We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens . #% We must not lose sight of the fact that any public money we can give is a mere drop in the ocean . #% Cynicism is an easy option and I will not indulge in it . #% The great towns and cities of my own region , the North West of England , were built on the back of an earlier great economic revolution , the Industrial Revolution . #% Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect , but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products . #% The constructive involvement of Parliament ' s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and Committee on Budgets also deserves thanks , and I will in a moment comment on the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets about which Mr Khanbhai spoke . #% It seems to me that this is not a question of Parliament coming cap in hand , begging for support . #% Our Parliament has forfeited certain rights by the process we have adopted on this Directive . #% I say this is a fundamental constitutional principle . #% These are good examples of how funding is being used to help establish networks between local organisations working in the same area . #% Secondly , I want to stress what has already been said by other speakers , that we need to be holistic about the way in which this reorganisation is carried forward . #% We want this to be a historic summit meeting that looks at employability , where there are no sacred cows and where on all sides of this House and on all sides of the political argument , we look maturely and sensibly at how to get our people back to work . #% A regime which resorts to murder and violence to oppress its own people , a people cheated of a government of their choice , simply can not be trusted , and we must take action . #% It is a first . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement and congratulate him on the measures which he has taken . #% We are talking about our European heritage , which we have a duty to protect . #% It is much easier to demand equality of treatment when you have clear rights . #% Was it the Council acting as the Council or was it intergovernmental ? #% I wish to begin by expanding on the objects of our two questions to the Council and to the Commission . #% The European Union can not be protectionist . #% In particular , we support the conclusions of our colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that more money must be allocated to new sources of employment , including the cooperative sector , environmental projects and local development initiatives . #% We started off on a very good footing and we worked well together throughout . #% That is something we might have different opinions as to the desirability of . #% My conclusion is that some Member States are doing themselves harm by having excessively high rates of tax , whereas they really ought to be reducing the tax burden on their citizens . #% He is right in one respect : as important as this for business , it is also important in terms of the quality of people 's lives and what they do with their leisure time . #% Having said that , we still await the World Bank report on the needs of Serbia . #% It will interest colleagues from this committee to know that many of those young designers were designing pedestrian-friendly cars but , in order to meet the EEVC Stage II tests , the only way they could meet those requirements was by putting the engine at the back of the car so as to leave enough crush space at the front . #% In my group 's view , all summits should be about sustainability , but I would settle for at least one a year as a start because the environment underpins our economic development , and if you do not have sustainability , you can kiss goodbye to the stability pact . #% My group will support the compromise proposed by our rapporteur and endorsed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism , but I stress that this suspension , as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski often says of the ` use it or lose it ' clause , is a one-off for one period and does not represent a green light for further suspensions . #% Has there been any rule change by the Bureau with regard to recorded votes ? #% The initial presumption must always , in my view , be against legislating . #% Mr President , you have already mentioned the tragic spate of terrorist bomb attacks against innocent civilians in Jerusalem and Baghdad on 19 August 2003 , and the gruesome attack in Bombay on 25 August 2003 . #% However , I welcome that the summit issued a clarion call of strong support for the International Criminal Court . #% Not only do consumers need to be reassured , but the industry also needs a climate of certainty within which to operate . #% It is , of course , to root out terrorism , to help build a peaceable , well-disposed , durable and better society and to ensure that the extremists do not set down fresh roots either within the country or elsewhere . #% We also acknowledge that small - but equally deserving - applicants have been disadvantaged in the past by the arcane nature and length of the assessment process . #% There are 200 million people in the region living in poverty . #% Commissioner , I am sure you will agree that current circumstances can not be allowed to continue . #% If so , I can support this . #% In particular , the appointing authority will have to decide whether to refer the case to a disciplinary board . #% Mr President , the Liberal Group strongly welcomes the report for not simply revisiting existing powers to improve clarity but for boldly seeking to adjust competences to face the challenges that the Union knows , especially in the foreign and security field . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I visited Montenegro twice during the past eighteen months , with my colleague Anna Ibrisagic from the PPE as shadow rapporteur , to form my own assessment of the country 's progress towards , first , candidate status and , now , the prospect of EU membership . #% Mr President , I would also like to welcome this report and the new directive . #% For the 14th consecutive year , the European Court of Auditors has only been able to give a qualified statement of assurance for the accounts of the European Union . #% Mr President , this report on financial assistance for innovation and job-creating SMEs carries the promise that resources will be made available to encourage the sort of entrepreneurship which will provide for sustainable growth in employment . #% I wish too that the jobs we are going to lose in the coal sector - 8 , 700 jobs - were the last that we will lose in the restructuring of the coal industry . #% Fourthly , we must intensify the dialogue on human rights . #% We repudiated at the time the anti-Americanism , both latent and overt , that characterises some in this House . #% This legislation does not reflect the real world . #% 
Madam President , we have heard some fine words this evening , but let us recall that the New Partnership for Africa 's Development -- NEPAD -- was a bargain . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , one of the challenges of trying to produce an oral question followed by an immediate resolution in a very short space of time is to get it to reflect fully everything we want it to say . #% We are looking forward to that bringing general benefits in the coming year . #% As rapporteur , his view was that by lowering the thresholds companies could work together in putting forward innovative projects that would benefit transport and , indeed , industry as a whole . #% I have had a look at the agendas for ECOFIN and general affairs meetings over the last year , and there has been only one item about personnel , which was about freelance interpreters in March 2000 . #% The third aspect of this particular budget is that it could be called the Member States jackpot budget because the Member States really have landed lucky . #% It has never made sense to hand over money to an organisation to spend in a manner that has evaded reform and which can not be accounted for . #% Certainly the social fund does apply in a horizontal way to activities that would retrain people and get them back into the labour market . #% Many of the points he raises are certainly to be welcomed . #% As my group 's shadow rapporteur on Slovakia it gives me particular pleasure to support its candidature . #% I have studied them in vain for a realistic business impact assessment . #% Parents who have agreed for a child to engage in prostitution or pornography should also be regarded as criminal offenders . #% He has now completely abrogated that position and he is therefore denying the democratic rights of the voters of the East Midlands , over 40 % of whom voted Conservative . #% Mr President , I want to refer to the part of the report which concerns the reform of state-owned enterprises . #% We have got to use institutions like the Bank for International Settlements to bring about greater supervision of cross-border lending , which would also help to bring stability and transparency in the system . #% However , let us learn one clear lesson for the future from all of this : a matter of such importance deserves thorough and long-standing preparation , particularly preparation of Europe 's public -- the citizens we seek to represent and who in large number we seem to have managed to antagonise over this proposal . #% That resignation is too little , too late . #% My reasons for delaying the final vote are so that we have absolutely maximum flexibility to negotiate with the political parties and with the institutions . #% It is very much in this context of overwhelming support for the objectives of the ECB and of praise for its achievements so far that my remaining remarks should be seen . #% These technocrats are totally out of touch with reality . #% However , we have a problem . #% Mr President , I believe that is not quite correct . #% I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise , but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka , bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka , Finnish vodka , Swedish vodka , Lithuanian vodka , and so on . #% Another 12 Christians died recently on the same day that the leader of Laskar Jihad , Thalib , launched his renewed jihad . #% We have to continue the fight for all EU citizens , disabled or non-disabled , to be treated equally . #% I am told by industry that the Commission 's proposals could be helpful but what Parliament is proposing will not be . #% This is wrong , we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field . #% Moving forward , she is right to say that we must look at a broad range of test measures . #% I would remind the House that four years ago , when adopting the report by Mrs De Palacio Vallelersundi and myself , we adopted a decision that the Rules should be revised by the services in all languages to ensure gender-neutral language . #% Would that not be an act of good faith with the ACP ? #% We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat . #% It would be wrong for the European Union to overstress the issue of capital punishment per se , which remains legal , if used appropriately , in international law . #% We must recognise that democratic norms , protection under the law and basic human rights have been abandoned in Zimbabwe for all elements of the population . #% He is also right to talk about improving labour mobility , because unless there is more flexibility in the labour markets , the economies can not fulfil their growth potential and the funds will simply not be there for governments to spend . #% We also need much bolder action to ensure poor people genuinely benefit from world trade . #% At this time , we need to further develop the coherence of the Lisbon process and reinforce it . #% Any other talk is irresponsible folly : it will only worsen the situation and cause bloodshed , not stop it . #% It must adhere to the Copenhagen criteria and the Commission 's report makes it very clear that it does not . #% With this report , we have a framework that will give us the data required to help practitioners - those at the coalface - plan and develop our tourism product here in the European Union . #% So I start this morning with a friendly warning to the railway industry that unless it gets its act together , and unless we all work together in the area of rail freight , it will disappear in 20 years or so . #% I wear another hat as the Chairman of the committee , thereby keeping an eye on the rapporteur . #% With the possible exception of Mr Berlusconi , no other EU leader is bold enough to make encouraging Euro-Atlantic integration noises to Ukraine . #% This unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation . #% It would be most unfortunate if we as the institutions of the EU saw this merely as a bureaucratic or a constitutional exercise to our own interest and our own advantage . #% It is as serious as that . #% I would be interested to hear the Commission 's views on how these two processes are going to tie in to each other , because there is a degree of overlap there . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Eriksson for her excellent report and Mr David Martin for bringing this idea to the House in the first place . #% Those rules are far too complicated anyway . #% Looking at the package of amendments to our Rules of Procedure tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I can say on behalf of my group that we will support the thrust of what the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has put forward . #% It was quite a challenge for many of them to deal with this rabble of argumentative poly-lingual MEPs who suddenly descended upon them , but on the whole those visits went extremely well . #% Yet Islam has played a part in Europe 's history and culture for centuries . #% So , in contrast to the last debate where I argued strongly that we should emphasise the principle of subsidiarity , this is a matter which is clearly trans-boundary and for both environmental and single market reasons should be dealt with by this Parliament . #% Now the US seems to be going back on that , just as it has done with textiles in relation to the Caribbean countries . #% If we move to one Commissioner per Member State and one vote per Commissioner , would we not be turning the Commission into a sort of Coreper , an intergovernmental body ? #% We all abhor and condemn terrorism . #% I would like to know if the Commission is making these threats and , if it is , whether it feels that it has an entitlement to do so . #% May I rebut John Stevens ' suggestion that the Socialist Group is soft on the independence of the ECB . #% It is regrettable and deplorable that , so far , the Presidency has failed to arrive at a common position . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I should like to ask Mr Barroso : why the unseemly haste ? #% They are the fundamental rights of all people regardless of who they are , where or to whom they are born . #% Furthermore , there are still unresolved border issues with Croatia 's neighbours and we do not wish to see these imported into the EU . #% Those are the critical issues we have to tackle . #% I would agree with the rapporteur in her view that the ten-year limit is not enough and also that the initial limits set on the amount of damages were inadequate considering the context in which this report came forward , namely the horrors of the BSE scandal . #% Yet almost all of them use chauffeur-driven limousines and ignore the trams . #% Procurement involves 11 % of the European Union GDP or ECU 720m of EU taxpayers ' money . #% In addition , unlike rental agreements that have to be renewed after a period of tenure , the cost of the Berlaymont to the Community budget is fully predictable because the annual payments of EUR 31.9 million and the annual step-up of 2 % were determined when the Berlaymont contract was signed with the Belgian authorities , by me , in October . #% 
Mr President , Indonesia is a massive country , both in terms of population and area . #% I believe the Commission can play a strong role in that respect . #% The Commission and its staff also played a vital role . #% I agree with Mr Bowis that an important part of our work is to build up this critical democratic culture in the ACP parliaments with which we work . #% Since 1972 the Community has signed nine conventions with UNRWA governing the EC contribution to the organisation ' s regular and food aid budgets . #% I have to say , Commissioners , that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest . #% What you are saying is that the Commission knows no more than national data protection supervisory authorities why these special searches are being made . #% Second , whilst retaining a 5 % eligible population for poor rural areas , we have also succeeded in redirecting some CAP support from within Heading 1 , off-farm , and Heading 2 , rural development . #% It was not democratic nation-states that caused the First and Second World Wars . #% The difficulty is how we move from the present disaster to future perfection , without disrupting the lives and occupations of fishermen to an impossible degree . #% Suggest that to them , Madame Palacio . #% Secondly , we must promote an exchange of ideas . #% Our group is not convinced that an interinstitutional agreement is sufficiently known to and understood by the public . #% We know that Mr Wibe , coming as he does from a Scandinavian background , is particularly interested in information technology . #% It was aimed not only at places as far-flung as Africa , but also within our own borders . #% On the administrative side , it is nice to see that the administrative formalities for forming a company have now acquired the cornerstone of the company statute . #% We recognise there is genuine public concern about these issues but would like to emphasise the need to keep these matters in perspective . #% Mr President , I would like to try to put a different perspective to this . #% Thus it is not new laws we need - we need more compliance . #% The objective of pursuing excellence above all else is crucial to achieving successful research at European level . #% Some would vilify me , take away my democratic rights and use hate-speak against me . #% I wonder if the Commissioner , looking forward , might learn some lessons from the case raised by my colleague and myself in terms of future reviews of the directive even if further action under the current rules appears not to be possible . #% I am very pleased at what you said about public procurement , and mutual recognition also needs to change . #% The rapporteur has said that we also need to make certain that safeguards are in place so that there is no intrusion into the privacy of victims . #% We also have put funds into the budget so that the Commission can come forward with a study establishing CFSP priorities over the next five years . #% That is why I personally refuse to sign off the conciliation because I believe we could have got more from the Council . #% We are , of course , as you know , entirely bound by the scientific evidence available to us at any particular time . #% Given their track record over the past year , there are grounds for suspicion of any foreign policy initiatives that originate from these governments . #% I support absolutely the Council 's decision to refer this matter to the Court and to use all the powers that there are under the agreements . #% That is why I say to the Commissioner that the ACP is not just for our good friend Mr Michel : it is for all the Commissioners in the College . #% It is essential to involve the people of Kosovo in the reconstruction process and to ensure effective coordination with non-governmental organisations . #% To ensure the success of this work , it is absolutely vital that the British , German , Polish , French and Italian Governments and the whole of the EU administration lend their support to this great work . #% Paragraph 38 , which sets out which substance shall be classified as being of very high concern , is too broad for any authorisation system to be workable . #% The new Member States now join these debates . #% Why should we deny protection to people who are working on inventions in that field ? #% I fully accept Mr Patten 's analysis that further impoverishment of the Palestinians will not discourage extremism but I have no doubt that the European Union should use its financial leverage with the Palestinians to greater political effect . #% In the UK , we consume very large amounts of pre-packed sliced bread and I think there is a very strong argument for exempting that from the regulation altogether and allowing Britain to sustain its current regulated pack sizes for this very important consumer commodity . #% There are ambitious and controversial agendas , but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so . #% I wonder what proportion of this stolen money belongs to Mr Mugabe and his associates . #% As you mentioned , there was a difficulty with two amendments . #% Furthermore , there is no dispute that the problem will continue to grow . #% The Referendum Commission in Ireland did not do its job , did not tell the Irish people that of course , the Lisbon constitutional treaty has profound impacts on their own constitution ; and , perhaps worst of all , the Broadcasting Commission in Ireland changed the rules , so there was not equal coverage for the ` yes ' and the ` no ' sides . #% Is that too simple for the EU ? #% Parliament recently adopted an amendment seeking an ambitious but realistic target of 60 % of electricity in the European Union coming from ultra-low or non-carbon-emitting sources . #% Does not the presidency feel that this would be an intrusion because it would force countries to adopt for one kind of election a system they find quite inappropriate in all the other elections they have ? #% However on the plus-side , we had worked hard to include references to the Lisbon Agenda , the completion of the internal market , and the involvement of national parliaments : this is the first time that such points have been accepted within such a social affairs report . #% In fact , more CO2 will be produced at the refinery by additional processing . #% A revised text must provide a concrete , step-by-step implemented mechanism , from dialogue to warning signals , and a spectrum of tools from smart sanctions to suspension , to add influence and authority to our interventions with persistent violators . #% In the world today we now face different challenges . #% What a disgrace it is that there are so many apologists for Saddam Hussein in this Chamber . #% So I will combine my remarks on both reports by saying that I believe we are taking the right course with Mrs Cederschiöld and the right course with Mr Cappato . #% They are challenges for governments ; they are challenges for businesses . #% In March this year therefore , the Commission issued reasoned opinions to all of the eight Member States concerned . #% It is , frankly , deeply disappointing that the Council has not acted with equivalent seriousness and speed , but I hope I can ask you once again , Commissioner , to do all you can to ensure that the Council does move swiftly on this . #% I feel that what has actually happened is that the agreement between President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder went in some way to undermine the way in which Commissioner Fischler was proposing his reforms . #% You can so decide under your authority as President . #% I hope it succeeds and thus sets a precedent that is the beginning of the end in the UK for the authority of these damaging and unnecessary regulations . #% I would ask Members to reject this report , until a study has been made of the practical implications and the cost of implementing its recommendations . #% Mr Lamy has been quoted as saying that the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China yielded 96 % of what the EU was demanding . #% Can I take the opportunity of Mr Sterckx ' s contribution to underline the point that I made earlier , a point which he wisely acknowledges , that no one , in consideration of the broad geographical balance to which the Commission is committed , should try to take a still-photograph of the profile of the staff at the Commission and represent that as in any way a permanent state of affairs . #% That is simply not the way to proceed . #% During the trialogue negotiations , it became clear to me that the improvements put forward by me on behalf of Parliament are essential for fair and effective energy markets . #% deputising for the author . - President-in-Office , I am reassured by some of what you say , but great concern remains about so much that may or may not have actually taken place , and we need to establish the facts . #% Finally , I should like to comment on the timing . #% Mr President , I should like to thank both the rapporteurs for producing quality reports . #% Turkey does not expect to be treated any more or any less favourably than any other candidate country , but it does expect to be treated fairly . #% 
I am not sure that if we had a DG Tourism it would in any case do much for the developing world . #% In fact I think people would probably be extremely shocked if we did . #% I hope that this is not going to be death by a thousand cuts . #% Would you agree with me , Commissioner , that support for parliaments is an area of our governance and democracy activities which has been somewhat neglected in the past ? #% We get a lot of lobbying on this from organisations asking us to include in the programme actions on one or other disease or condition . #% It is right , as the Declaration says , that European institutions should become closer to the citizens , less intrusive , less unwieldy and more efficient and open to democratic scrutiny . #% Mr President , with an issue of this importance it is necessary that we indicate to those still on the premises that a vote is taking place . #% Give nations some freedom to determine their own agricultural policies and to decide for themselves how they want to ensure their own health and safety . #% But we can be pleased with the outcome . #% I want to look today at the decisions which have been taken in the light of the Commissioner 's earlier statement , to which very few have so far referred . #% We have to do something about enforcement Europe-wide . #% I should just like to add one fact : in the UK and Europe drugs cocktails have decreased AIDS deaths by 75 % , in sub-Saharan Africa , where two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live , only one person in a thousand receives drug treatment . #% . -- Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Bauer for the work she has done on this excellent report , and the Commission for its initial document . #% However , recent developments in Zimbabwe are worrying . #% Let us see something , as we move forward , that offers preventative justice for EU citizens and small businesses ; that really gives us an instrument which means justice for growth . #% I would oppose very strongly the idea that `` EU '' should be on the label and not the country and region of origin . #% Madam President , I would like to thank Bill Miller for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work . #% So often we have seen a high price paid in human lives . #% This requires agreement on the decommissioning procedures and the timescale . #% How is it possible that the EU continues to allow the political wing of Hamas to operate and gather funds for its activities and so-called charities in the EU ? #% This should really open up the internal market to the many and increasing opportunities which e-commerce promises to businesses of all sizes , but particularly SMEs . #% But the question I want to ask you today is perhaps far more serious than anything that has happened in Greece or Ireland or Portugal to date . #% Maybe we need to look for more checks in the future . #% It has lots of great ideas but it is very unfocused and it is also very underdeveloped at this stage . #% To make one other point , for those who are unaware of the issue , this is not an opportunity to give free publicity to Coca Cola in this Chamber . #% It does not seek to be fully comprehensive and it does not try to duplicate information which is already available from , for example , EU websites , or to provide an account of action taken by individual Member States . #% But she has more than ably taken on and developed the work that I and Mr Deva have been involved in the past and I warmly thank and congratulate her on her work . #% CO2 limits for new vans will lead to cleaner , more fuel-efficient vehicles in the EU . #% They are unnecessary and divisive . #% It is described as bureaucratic . #% Equally , the problems of peripherality in my own region of South-West England mean that special attention must be paid to the most isolated areas , such as , in my region , Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly . #% Some indeed , as we heard just now in the debate , still seem to have the fanciful idea that this Treaty is setting up a centralised superstate : I find it astonishing that they can read the Treaty of Nice and genuinely believe that . #% Yesterday , one of its principal members , the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , attacked the proposals from the Convention as threatening to bring about a federal state with centralised fiscal policy . #% We need jobs which are based on technology , in particular the use of the Internet and ISDN technology . #% Mr Ford has already pointed out , and I am sure that Mr Crowley would have done so had he been here , that we lack flexibility in the organization of one aspect of our work : the response we have to reports that come from committees or outside bodies . #% Mr President , at a time when the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe have been subject to quite a great deal of criticism from EU Heads of Governments , and from European Commissioners and others , for making their views on the Iraq crisis known , the ELDR Group strongly welcomes the statement from the European Commission that the central priority must and will remain enlargement . #% Mr President , there can be no compromise with those who hate freedom and democracy . #% It is true that mistakes were made in the early stages and a lot of these mistakes were due to confusion between the regional and national governments . #% The election led initially to the hope that authority would be upheld , corruption rooted out and the economy put back on track , in particular stopping the asset-stripping and tax evasion seen in other CIS countries . #% Mr President , energy security and diversification of the source of supply has dramatically risen up the political agenda this year following the use of the ` gas weapon ' by Gazprom against Ukraine and Moldova over the New Year period . #% There is something that most Members do more often than most of our fellow citizens : we fly in aeroplanes . #% I know the majority of Turkish Cypriots want that positive response . #% As Günter Verheugen pointed out , with the industry in such a dire position at the moment because of a lack of demand , that regulatory stability is crucially important . #% That is the assurance , or reassurance , that the public in the European Union requires . #% Such choices , indeed , are a valid and intrinsic part of local political life . #% I find that rather odd . #% SMEs will have costs but there is a level playing field across the European Union . #% Mr President , from the point of view of the Committee on Foreign Affairs one of our priorities has to be to ensure that our delegations in other Member States are properly looked after , in particular in relation to security . #% We consider that so-called ` Internet Chat Rooms ' should be subject to greater monitoring , both of the rules for their installation and in relation to their use . #% The Council did not want to use it and we went to the wire , if you can remember that famous occasion in this Chamber when we each had two voting lists . #% A notable thing about this directive is that it has been good politics . #% Some recent comments , including those by the German Chancellor , are of great importance and need to be taken seriously . #% My amendment talked about long-term care , not long-term intensive care . #% We also need to lead the way , as people have said , on ratification . #% Finally , I would make a plea on behalf of my group : let us not set up yet another agency . #% As British Conservatives , we are insistent that , in return for enhanced development assistance , recipient countries should implement their side of the bargain , namely good governance , the rule of law and respect for human rights . #% We in Parliament need to ask ourselves whether we are getting value for money . #% Are you aware of recent public opinion surveys showing that the British people are opposed to the transfer of further powers from the nation state to Brussels , and how will you take those facts into account ? #% I understand that he has done his utmost within his competence as Commissioner to thoroughly oversee this matter where it falls under his responsibility . #% Mr President , on this report the British Conservatives will abstain . #% Do different countries have different patterns ? #% I am nonetheless shocked at the tactic of some of those who oppose it . #% Well , many regulatory bodies across the world have evaluated aspartame and none have come forward with evidence that suggests that knowledge has developed in such a way as to doubt previous authorisations . #% Clearly , nobody here has any experience of the armed forces . #% A negative result in the forthcoming referendum in Iceland on this issue could prove a serious handicap with regard to support from the UK Government . #% So that again was not exactly impressive . #% 
Last but not least in the use of the reserve is the question of value for money . #% It has become a byword for state-sponsored violence and horror , with the Tonton Macoutes and the years of Papa Doc . #% We need Member States to adopt and implement the quality of service standards devised by CEN so that we can compare like with like . #% There are people who use the Internet to entrap young women and children into prostitution rings . #% We want a further reduction to 46 % . #% But you have struck a real blow for the Eurosceptic movement in the UK , Sir Robert , I congratulate you . #% That is tremendous progress . #% The activities of the 2006 directive account for 40 % of EU GDP and jobs . #% This becomes very odd when you consider that these are three of the most reluctant EU Member States . #% Paragraphs 3 and 4 spell out some pretty clear pictures . #% I would hope that , when this Parliament looks at those two reports , we act in a sensitive manner and make sure that we do not pass any resolution or any proclamation that can be used as evidence that here , in the European Union , we are anything other than an example , a shining beacon to the world of religious tolerance . #% As he suggests , we should be looking forward rather than backward now . #% I was one of only three British MEPs -- all UKIP of course -- that opposed the last wave of enlargement . #% At the moment there are currently nine other environment cases which have come back to the Court of Justice for a second time because countries have ignored earlier judgments . #% It is merely one of the many ways in which Gordon Brown succeeds in fiddling the figures . #% I have been impressed by the results obtained in England by the Criminal Investigation Unit , working with lawyers under what are already very extensive rules and regulations , but respecting professional privilege . #% It is also hoped that the Member States will continue to exchange best practice in this field and co-ordinate measures which are taken in co-operation with the industry and with content providers . #% So , decent health and safety standards are now for the first time on the table for many of these workers only because of the social dialogue . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , I am very pleased that the Commissioner reminded us that the overwhelming amount of movement in the region has been in North Africa itself . #% The substantial derogations that have been accepted , the lack of convincing enforcement measures , the lack of sanctions for non-compliance all cast doubt on whether the small commitments made by Russia and Canada will in reality achieve anything . #% By a convincing majority the Committee on Legal Affairs voted in a series of sensible modifications that would have blunted some of the harm that this directive , if it is not changed , is going to do to the economy and employment throughout the European Union . #% How can we do better in the future ? #% An informed consumer is an empowered citizen . #% It is only right , therefore , that Bulgaria should be treated at least as well by the European Union as other countries that have had to close prematurely their ageing nuclear facilities , and I am glad that the Commission recognises this . #% Mr President , as one of the last Socialist Group speakers today I would like to clarify certain points which have arisen during the debate with regard to the report by Mr Langen . #% It has been a consistent complaint of the European Parliament for the last decade that procedural safeguards and defendants ' rights have not received the same attention , let alone action , as moves to enhance the speed and efficiency of investigations and of prosecutions . #% When we envisage a post-2006 Union with 500 million people or more , how will it be possible to run a Union with fewer Commissioners than we have today ? #% Now where is it ? #% Mr President , each village and town in England has a line around it for planning purposes , stating that it is a defined village or town settlement . #% I have been to the marshlands of Iraq many times , the antique heritage of the world , the marshlands of Mesopotamia . #% It is not our job always to say , after there has been scientific appraisal , that is not good enough , and there should be further appraisal immediately . #% People in the Central Highlands are suffering badly as well as the Catholic Hmong people and the Mennonite followers in the country . #% In conclusion , I congratulate Bulgaria and thank the Commission and the Council for all the support they have given to Bulgaria 's accession process . #% One of the three main issues we are told that advice services deal with is that of people who have resigned from their job in order to move to another country with their partner or spouse and who lose entitlement to unemployment benefits by doing so ; hence Amendments Nos 2 and 43 from the committee . #% Why are we neglecting ` big ' renewables in favour of covering our hillsides with windmills and our roofs with solar panels ? #% I beg the House 's indulgence . #% Incidentally , I have been involved in Parliament 's working group looking at EU funding to the Palestinian Authority , which is proceeding on schedule . #% However , we do not want a directive of the kind set out here , which is a naked political directive . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's views on those things and I apologise for repeating some of the other excellent remarks made in this debate . #% The proposal has been made in detailed form . #% Mr President , I shall also focus my remarks on the Green Paper communication . #% There are great opportunities for , and advantages in , addressing this problem by using technology which is in the process of being developed or has been developed to change our practices and reduce global warming . #% The days of negotiations on technical matters behind closed doors are gone forever . #% The last sentence would then read : ' Calls on the Commission to include reference to territories as well as countries in Annex V. ' #% He was happy to support this , but very wisely suggested that any such amendment should be put into the main body of the statute report , in other words , the Hans-Peter Mayer report . #% The initial voluntary quotas on exports to the United States bought from the Japanese by President Nixon in exchange for the return of Okinawa to Japanese rule , later extended to Europe , led to a situation where unmet demand allowed Japanese corporations to make super-profits which , reinvested , exacerbated the problems in the long term . #% It was a telling point that as a member of her IND/DEM Group she was willing to be rapporteur to play a constructive role in the work of our Parliament , unlike her colleagues from the so-called UK Independence Party , who , I believe - if I am right - have never been rapporteurs for any report in this Parliament in the four-and-a-half years since a motley crew of 12 of them were elected at the last European elections . #% The Olympics and other global sporting events should be a time when all enmities are put aside between sportsmen and women . #% The case for the project is overstated and I do not think it is financially credible . #% And they should be approved by the national regulator , rather than be the subject of one-sided negotiations between a monopoly infrastructure operator and a potential user . #% Many of us have had big problems with the whole country of origin theory -- I do not think it is a principle -- and how this , for example , might fit with the ability of Member States to seek higher standards , which is also allowed . #% By introducing the same rule across the whole of our single European market , we lessen that problem at a stroke , ensure a level playing field for our producers and protect chickens across 25 countries . #% You might have also noticed that we drive on the left and that there are certain other differences in the road systems in the UK . #% Mr President , I should just like to make an observation about the law of unintended consequences . #% I naturally hope that the free movement of people who have the misfortune to be HIV-positive is not restricted in any way on grounds of public health . #% It was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the European Union . #% It is not up to the European Union to tell its Member States what procedure they should use internally to ratify a treaty setting up a constitution . #% We are asked to consider a mid-term review , but there seems little to review . #% I am just referring to the Haug report not to Mr Ferber ' s. #% I should like to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the British Conservative Group , the European Democrat wing of the EPP , and say why we oppose the regulation being extended to agricultural tractors . #% As you know , we will be discussing this next week with the Presidency in Athens . #% As my colleague on the London Assembly has said , these figures are an absolute disgrace . #% Since today is International Women 's Day , this would be a good message to send , as this is a problem we can do something about . #% I guess the answer can only be Mr Barroso , because he is the only one that anybody in the world has ever heard of and is probably the big winner out of these posts . #% We all know that we are very good at talking about it and we are equally bad at doing anything material to address the problem . #% Madam President , I am pleased that there has been an agreement . #% 
I am pleased to say that we have a report that I fully support and I would ask the House to give it its full backing in the vote later today . #% That is not acceptable to the people of this European Union . #% We must act to curb it and ensure that our young people are protected from exploitation and its destructive effects by hard-pressed or greedy employers . #% Everyone in Parliament and the public is delighted to hear that and thank you for your very full reply . #% As the report says , it is important that the AU is the legitimate political and mandated institution at this stage . #% And once given residence in EU Member States , those illegal immigrants would find it easier to enter Britain , thereby adding to the burden of illegal immigration in the UK . #% What are the Community 's financial interests ? #% Parliament 's report will give the search for alternatives a new urgency . #% Your so-called reservation against the output targets properly voted by Parliament precisely to increase spending on basic health and education is contrary to the agreed budget . #% Whilst I do not object to EU legal cooperation , I strongly believe that we need to ensure that the legislation we produce at EU level is legally sound , robust and can be effectively implemented at Member State level without compromising existing Member State legal systems . #% Just because they find it difficult , because they think it costs them money - probably because they do not want to comply with all the requirements - they want more discretion to give contracts not on an open basis . #% Could Commissioner Liikanen confirm for me that the Court of Justice decisions C-70 / 94 and C-83 / 94 give the Commission the power to challenge Member States on their interpretation of Article 296 , which they have taken as a carte blanche , which is not what the Treaty of Rome intends ? #% The European Parliament has also taken the view in the resolution that the Union should be taking a strong , leading role at the Johannesburg Summit , as it did on the Kyoto Protocol . #% Finally , with the run-up to the World Cup in Germany , we need to do much more to make people aware . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ó Neachtain , and to welcome the Commissioner here . #% Tunisia has managed to resist the efforts of violent Jihadis to undermine the integrity of its secular society . #% I certainly find it a matter of concern that the Commission , whilst acting as investigator , prosecutor , judge and jury in competition cases , can make public statements condemning the people it is investigating , or happily allow confidential documents to enter the public domain without any apparent concern or investigation . #% When I raised this before , President Borrell wrote a letter to the Commission asking Commissioners to be crisper in their answers . #% Madam President , I should also like to congratulate Lyndon Harrison for a very comprehensive and searching report which seeks to complete the single market . #% The Ferret Trust have been following me around over the last few days in a state of great excitement about the provisions on ferrets . #% Mr President , along with Mr Mendiluce Pereiro I went to Bosnia last week to study the situation for myself . #% To supplement these measures the report rightly calls for more high quality education . #% We have now had three interparliamentary delegation meetings and the resolution calls for the Koreans to come here again to continue the dialogue . #% To take , for instance , the convergence of the telecommunication industries , audio and computer technology , which I feel pose fundamental questions regarding the way in which we produce and consume these industries . #% Corruption and judicial reform have not been properly addressed . #% Staff qualifications are extremely important and they are very lacking in this area . #% In fact we voted for stem cell research to be financed from the EU budget at the last part-session . #% That is what will be successful in third generation . #% This is a longstanding issue in some Member States , in particular my own . #% Demographics change and so do working practices . #% I must admit that my views on points of detail have changed many times , but I have come to the conclusion that , while backing a closed-loop recycling system for cadmium batteries in the medium term , we should be looking in the long term for the replacement of such batteries because of their toxicity . #% I am appalled that the Libyan prosecution has again called for the death penalty during the most recent court hearing on 29 August . #% The proposal is to incorporate this into the European Forest Law Enforcement , Governance and Trade process , which I welcome . #% Neither fear is an accurate representation of reality . #% I am convinced that there will be time now before a final decision is taken in Council for discussions to continue . #% I am glad that the focus of this is towards civil society and NGOs and towards listening to their views , rather than just listening to tabloid newspapers and other protagonists of the debate . #% We must press for the highest possible standards , for maximum cooperation , and constantly keep the situation under review and monitor progress . #% The Commission has not put in place all the 20 extra staff it said were necessary to deliver energy efficiency commitments and , for that reason , the timetable on the action plan has slipped . #% I personally fail to see the difference . #% We could not do it because we could not quite agree on the right amount of sheep premium or the exact sugar quota or exactly what sort of portfolio a Commissioner should have for two months ' ? #% Lastly I turn to CAP reform . #% In Amendment No 4 , I propose an extra three-year transition for the self-employed , and then their automatic inclusion . #% There was no evidence of a willingness to take tough choices , the kind of choices which are being taken by governments all over Europe at this time . #% Where help is needed , for third world islands or otherwise , let trade be their aid . #% We need to look very carefully at those . #% Therefore , the registration procedures have to be simple , easy and cost-effective . #% - I , together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation , am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life . #% It is time for the EU to engage in a thorough and comprehensive review and to connect and balance the external and internal dimensions of its policy on human rights . #% I would encourage them to bring some sense to the positions of their own governments and to bring us back to the more sensible negotiating line that most governments at least those of the original six Member States and the United Kingdom seem to be taking at the beginning of the IGC , in allowing this draft Constitution go through intact , albeit with a few technical adjustments . #% Secondly , I wish to support the continuation of our European programme for intra-subsidy loans to small companies but to call for clear improvements in the way that these loans are administered . #% What specific measures do you intend to initiate immediately to provide the management that EU producers so require ? #% That is why this report is so important : it is providing a mechanism in terms of active citizenship , which is becoming more and more important , for instance electronic democracy . #% That means reviewing the length of time we spend on the contradictoire procedure . #% So we feel that we are perhaps rather more in touch with public opinion than all the rest of the Groups in this Parliament . #% Finally , I would like to point out that in fact the Treaties are very clear . #% I hear of terrible new cases every day . #% As Mr Corrie said , driven underground , the implications of this trade for public health are appalling . #% Several Members here met General Musharraf some months ago , both in Brussels and later in Islamabad , and we received a number of assurances . #% This is a promising start , but Pakistan has yet to accede to the request to extradite the 20 ringleaders of the plot . #% He also gives us a very timely reminder in his report that 75 % of the 1.2 billion living on less than one dollar a day are in rural areas . #% We need better access in order to move forward . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Ullmann for his - as ever - conscientious work and extremely good report . #% In particular , the farmers in the Allendale Valley , the scene of the recent hotspot , believed that they had taken all the necessary measures to avoid the disease . #% Men and women require , above all , to work in societies where economic growth leads to more and better career and job opportunities , thus enabling the higher degree of social provision this report states it wishes to see . #% We should be proud that we are putting in place a sound structure at European level to finance the work of European political parties . #% We also need to be wary of creating a feeling amongst people that everyone is a potential terrorist or criminal . #% 
Madam President , I endorse emphatically what my colleague Mrs Graenitz said , both in congratulating the rapporteur and speaking to those elements in these amendments which seem to me to be profoundly important . #% But the Commission , as an institution , has been slow in acknowledging its institutional culpability ; and , I have to say , had the Commission applied the principles of forensic accounting properly , then the saga that was the European Year of Tourism would have been laid to rest in days rather than weeks . #% While I could approve some individuals , others I would vote against . #% Mr President , I have always regarded it as one of the privileges of being a Member of this Parliament to work alongside Mrs Pack . #% That is not to say that it does not make very valuable points , or that there is anything in it with which I am in substantive disagreement . #% Today there is a strike at Strasbourg airport and many Members are unable to make proper travel arrangements . #% I believe that the US must reconsider its position and come back to Bonn with some really good proposals . #% We need to look at that in the context of social cohesion overall , because it has implications for the gap between rich and poor . #% You say that the troika will have access to areas and to as many individuals as it wants . #% In my opinion newspapers should be VAT-free . #% Mr President , this House is fast demonstrating that it can solve things that even the Council can not solve . #% We should defend this amendment because it specifically states that such products should have no demonstrable adverse effect on food hygiene . #% Among the adult population , the growth of the number of thyroid-gland cases has increased fivefold . #% Mr Barroso , you will not succeed unless you do this . #% In my own country , this is often a problem because the costs are so high and , where we have some form of fixed fee , the fees are so low that lawyers decline the work . #% I also welcome the decision that was going to be taken , but has not , not to withdraw money from the Life Programme for the environmental projects that are so important . #% . Madam President , all three countries of former Indochina have been ravaged by war and now , sadly , they suffer from political oppression . #% I had the opportunity to participate in the first ASEP meeting here in Strasbourg back in 1996 and in last week 's second ASEP meeting in Manila , where we achieved a unanimity of views with statements on terrorism , the environment , on human rights for women and children . #% Mr President , I too support the excellent Hyland report . #% They want to be governed by their own people in their own parliament . #% Let us not forget those people either . #% There has to be an end to impunity and , as the Commissioner said , a much clearer determination is essential to achieve demilitarisation , demobilisation and then rehabilitation in that country . #% The procedure renders futile attempts to monitor the numbers of sharks being caught . #% Madam President , this is a very difficult debate because , interestingly , groups that are normally homogeneous are split ; political allies who normally work with one another are split . #% I will now try to be as brief as I possibly can in response to the very good points that have been made by honourable Members in the course of this debate . #% However much we try , there will be material requiring disposal . #% The EU boasts about having a trade and aid approach to international solidarity . #% We are all well aware of the problems experienced in some cities in Europe , such as Athens , where the problem is intensified by particular climatic conditions . #% Hence my committee ' s call for rapid progress in enabling people to work efficiently through effective consultation and participation , because democracy is also part of sustainability , as are reduced working hours and good quality work in safe working conditions supported by an effective system of social security . #% There has been a huge growth in the amount of money being used to support this production . #% Despite reported cases documented in this report of rape , fraud , paedophile pornography , misuse of funds , harassment , theft , forgery , striking and wounding , depraved behaviour , aggression , corruption and conflict of interest , only one individual has been dismissed in the last five years . #% It was clear to me that Zahir Shah , in spite of his advanced age , was both cogent and fit enough to do the job , after conducting a lengthy one-and-a-half-hour interview with myself and my colleagues . #% They do not have an independent vote as an independent state . #% As Mr Duisenberg put it recently when he described the euro as a symbol of political integration , we have here yet another symbol - the European Aviation Safety Agency . #% This is as logical as saying that Greece should shut down its border in Thrace with Turkey in solidarity with the Greek Cypriots over the Turkish occupation of Cyprus . #% This afternoon , when we debate Iraq , do not forget the missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war . #% That is very important , as it is to look at what countries such as Uganda are doing , which is to decentralise the health service and take it out of the main cities , into the rural areas . #% I believe that so long as the Commission shares that aim , we should be able to work together . #% Consequently , there is a greater and more serious health risk in that sector than in meats that are cooked before being consumed by the public . #% Other measures would in addition enhance social integration . #% The European region plays a vital part as the intermediary between the citizen and the supranational authorities . #% Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities . #% What sort of message is this giving out to sports organisers ? #% We believe in cooperation rather than compulsion ; and therefore we voted against this report . #% I , too , have some doubts about the formula of the Commission . #% It has a minor border dispute with Croatia , which it will resolve peacefully before the International Court of Justice . #% The longer this illegal action by France continues , the more it damages the reputation of the whole of the European Union . #% It now looks almost certain that there will not be a meeting under this Presidency . #% We can not complain about what is going on in the candidate states if we have amendments like this being put forward in the European Union . #% So we face a serious situation . #% Immigrant groups will also benefit . #% The committee considered this matter over several meetings and finally came to the decision , by a large and persuasive majority , that it would not be appropriate in this case to give him the benefit of this House 's immunity . #% The Commission will say that we need more harmonisation measures to make it work . #% It is our view that our shortcomings in common security and defence policy have been ruthlessly exposed by the Iraq conflict and that , in consequence , has badly damaged the transatlantic partnership . #% All we can hope is that the budget , as it now stands , will be adequate to take the programme forward . #% Mr President , I welcome the various reports , the Blak , Stauner , Folias , Seppänen , van der Laan and Rühle reports , because I know so much work went into them . #% It is not usual for us to be in agreement , but certainly when it comes to financial perspective of 1999 , I was against it for precisely the same reasons that he mentioned - how can you plan so far into the future ? #% We reject the hard right-wing view of those conservatives in the EPP who seek to restrict the right to asylum and protection . #% So I very much support the calls for Mr Nikitin to be immediately released and found not guilty of the charges . #% If by doing so we will be standing by the so-called commitment , we will not be standing by our commitments to attack poverty , to prevent conflict , as Michel Rocard says , and to promote gender equity . #% The resolution before us is one that I can fully support as it is concise and sticks to the issues of the summit and our relations with the Canadian Government . #% I am sure the Commissioner will appreciate that people resident on the south coast of England , while they may not be facing a serious threat , need to be assured that the European Commission itself is looking into these problems . #% Reference to regions should not be an alternative to country of origin but a voluntary addition . #% Secondly , as regards preparing for abolition , perhaps he could come to my constituency , speak to the company P&O Stena and suggest which particular members of staff they lay off and which ships they suspend from service . #% Secondly , we can say that it is the ` mad cow ' supplementary and amending budget . #% If I could perhaps ask a couple of supplementary points : in his list of countries involved in the various studies on the Stop Programme , he did not actually mention the United Kingdom . #% 
People here today will appreciate that it requires all parties to pay attention to what is happening at the Channel Tunnel and to make sure that they do not allow it to be obscured by the mere arguments , cultural or political , that exist there . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - Mr President : one minute , two points . #% Do we respond to UN calls to unblock roads to bring food and aid to the north ? #% Well as the President of the Commission said , quite clearly , that could be regarded as a joke but certainly it was not a paper that was received by the United Kingdom Government . #% So , my congratulations ! #% Mr President , we very much welcome the cooperation agreement which is an affirmation of the good relations between the European Union and Bangladesh and provides a framework for their further expansion . #% As long as we have acceptance of the upper safe limit , consumer choice should prevail . #% From 1985 he has ruled as a tyrant . #% We know that the illegal trade in wildlife is the second biggest direct threat to species after habitat destruction . #% The fact is that we now have to vote in a different way for a different structure , and hopefully get it right , as well as deal with enlargement . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's initiatives in bringing forward ideas to try to solve that problem . #% In our report we have entered a definition which we hope will be acceptable internationally . #% I know some people in this House were angry about that . #% I begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and specifically the rapporteur , Mr Miller , for this very constructive report on the Commission 's proposal for a time and numbers-limited early retirement scheme . #% It is an agreement which we can welcome . #% The European Council should also begin to take some firm decisions on the size and shape of the ESDP mission to Kosovo as a signal of its intention . #% When you are supporting a product that , in my view , is harmful , there is implied support for the whole industry and I regret that . #% They have been denied bail , the evidence has been presented in secret and there has been no transparent schedule of court hearings . #% There is a challenge for Parliament in playing its part in helping Europe to become the dynamic centre of sustainable job creation , innovation , competitiveness and modernised social welfare . #% I can support most of their amendments , but I have strong reservations about 10 out of the 51 amendments . #% Mr President , terrorism threatens all of us . #% The fourth ` E ' , Europe , in my country sometimes seems a less obvious choice . #% The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier . #% So please can we have proper disclosed coordination of the response ? #% So please , Commissioner , ensure that everything is done to make sure this European debate will actually take place . #% Mr President , all one can say is here we go again folks , roll up and see the incredible bureaucrats of Brussels make another 1.2 million pounds of taxpayers money vanish in the blink of an eye . #% I welcome the Commission 's statements condemning that drift . #% The ACP regions are far more interested in addressing supply side constraints and the link between EPAs and development support . #% Do you not think it is time , given the state of the debate on economic and monetary union and the very clear shift of public opinion in Europe now , to rebalance economic and monetary union so that we can prove to the citizens of the European Union that we can have , on the one hand , a successful economic and monetary union and on the other hand , that we can tackle the problem of unemployment ? #% Commissioner Lamy , I do not expect you to agree with this analysis , but at the very least you should acknowledge the very real anger and frustration of the developing countries throughout the conference and pledge that in the negotiations that are now beginning their interests will genuinely be at the forefront of our priorities . #% Now we can say that the banana barons in the United States are actually buying the United States and buying favours from the people on Capitol Hill in Washington . #% I make no apologies for repeating what I said in my speech at first reading : we know that there are far too many contracts in all areas of public procurement that are not being properly put onto the Official Journal system . #% And was the Joint Committee itself bound by the terms of the Europe Agreements between the EU and the Visegrad countries and did they specify a timetable for extension ? #% There was some objection from some of the Member States , notably Germany and , to a lesser extent , France , to the introduction of the EHLASS scheme in the first instance . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Frattini for his very helpful and very commendable introduction to this important subject . #% The final point -- by what means and by whom will Parliament be informed of the position taken by the Commission within the various organs of the Energy Community Treaty -- has been answered in general terms in the Commissioner 's letter . #% Madam President , I should like to start by commending the rapporteur 's work on this portfolio , it is an important matter . #% Fundamentalism and intolerance are growing threats . #% Mr President , I thank the minister for his extremely interesting speech and for his support for the setting up of a Council of Ministers within a defence formation . #% Further , the Member States should have the possibility to convene meetings and have items entered on the agenda of the committee . #% We should instead say that this is only the first step . #% You also were outstanding in the way you kept us informed and kept us up to date with the negotiations . #% The drive to outlaw them seems driven by a refusal to confront this statistic in the interests of certain national battery manufacturers and the inability to confront public misconceptions as to the real situation of cadmium pollution . #% You have pushed on with your obsession with climate change , which has led to massive costs and no material benefits whatsoever . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but , in my experience , that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation , because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it . #% In its recent anti-secession laws , China has also shown a belligerent attitude towards democratic Taiwan , which serves as a model to completely rebut those who say that China is too big and Chinese people too culturally different from the West to have democracy and high standards of human rights . #% It concerns a small but important modification of an existing directive which needs to be implemented before the end of this year in order to prevent many European companies from being in breach from January onwards . #% You pick up a bottle -- like this elegant Pomerol , for example -- and try to find out something about it . #% The proposal , as we know , sets out measures to protect human health and the environment from the risks associated with activities working with genetically modified organisms in contained conditions . #% It must also provide humanitarian support for Nigeria , where over 200 people have died of cholera in the last few weeks , and help the people who have been displaced as a result of this violence . #% The national emissions ceiling directive will provide the framework for reductions in key air pollutants . #% Having said that , there is another exception which is more controversial , which is ordinary private copying . #% We can not afford to forget that trade liberalization and economic growth alone are not sufficient to reduce poverty . #% I am glad Mrs Schreyer mentioned earlier the additional monies for the Veterinary Office which are particularly important if we want them to deal with the problems that have arisen because of the BSE crisis , the dioxin crisis in Belgium and of course the continued work in Portugal . #% The real question is - what is the cost if we do not enlarge the European Union ? #% Nothing would be worse than for this process to be held up because of reprisal killings by the Israeli Government if the Palestinian authority is genuinely committed to peace now . #% However , there is an understandable concern about flights carrying nuclear materials . #% That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action . #% Earlier in the day Mr Poettering criticised the Council for not giving a timetable for the liberalisation of postal services . #% He would be better using taxpayers ' money on his phone bill telling his mate , Mr Berlusconi , to switch his candidate . #% Madam President , this is an excellent occasion to have a discussion on the transatlantic partnership , now that the Iraq conflict is over and the dust is settling in the desert and before the Council and Commission head to Washington at the end of this month . #% I also welcome the recognition that there are forms of persecution which are not included in the Geneva Convention . #% We are very concerned about the capital market and there needs to be capital market reform . #% Only then will we be satisfied that we have a fair process in place on multilateral investments . #% The advantage of this , referring to some of the points you raised in your introduction , Commissioner , is that this money is frontloaded , it is long term , it is stable and it is predictable money . #% I want to concentrate on some of the achievements of the summit and , in particular , the policy that I called for after the Geneva Summit , which relates to how we can spread the capacity for computer science and research to the developing world so that they can develop their own products . #% 
My good friend Mr Silva Peneda says that this report proposes more flexibility and is good for SMEs . #% I note Commissioner Patten 's reservations about this aspect . #% It would be quite wrong for Amendments 4 , 19 and 23 to fall if Amendment 15 is adopted , as the voting list suggests . #% All Member States must , by their very nature , be strong and confident enough to accept criticism . #% It is a pity that this service was left out of the Article 13 anti-discrimination directive by the Council . #% But it is a matter for the Member States to decide whether they will participate or not . #% I shall confine myself to commenting on that for the record this evening . #% This will involve an eventual total withdrawal from the occupied territories and a dismantling of all the illegal settlements . #% We are reminded that in the fight against terrorism our democracies must take care not to abuse civil liberties and human rights . #% A recent UK parliamentary report on water privatisation has shown that many poorer people , such as pensioners , have had such difficulty in meeting their bills that they have been cutting their water use to a bare minimum . #% The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government . #% - The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted against Amendment No 7 because we do not feel that a reference to the supposed ` Echelon ' network is appropriate to this report . #% I wish these negotiations over the name could get somewhere - they seem to drag on . #% These include the following : firstly , following President Prodi 's statement to Parliament last month about the comitology aspects of the Lamfalussy proposal , the Commission has agreed that the relevant and appropriate principles contained in it will be applied pari passu in this instance . #% It is vital that Parliament and all other interested stakeholders have a proper opportunity to input into this very important process , and I am glad that Commissioner Lamy has agreed to that . #% I would say there is a role for the bureaucrats here as well as the shareholders . #% I and my colleagues on this side of House and some others will be working consistently for that in the months ahead . #% Madam President , I gave notice to the Secretary-General of Parliament that I would raise a point of order at the beginning of budget votes today . #% The limit values which have been set , as Mr Correia indicates , are for a common European standard . #% I welcome the Commission 's intention to draw up partner national action plans for children . #% Clare Short , MP , is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government . #% An issue was raised about the cost . #% I intended to vote yes on the Rübig Report . #% We have an instinct that we do not like to see the Council spending large sums of money in managing foreign policy without proper accountability . #% All who wish to express solidarity tonight with Liu , his wife Liu Xia and all prisoners of conscience in China , should recognise that the rest of the world has too often put trade interests with China before our mutual obligations on human rights . #% You want your voice to be heard , not to be further marginalised . #% Commissioner , what is the point of our passing laws if they are not enforced ? #% Just last week a pregnant woman and a four-year-old child were killed during the mass eviction of 10 000 people from the outskirts of Harare . #% It is a great pity that we do not have the flexibility to insert on our agenda a debate on the threat of nuclear war in Asia between India and Pakistan . #% in writing . - This resolution sends a clear signal to the other institutions that the European Parliament is willing to start serious negotiations in order to resolve the current budget deadlock and to decide upon a budget for 2011 as soon as possible . #% Europe should stand up for the rights of the citizen and force industry to take responsibility . #% My impression is that there are concerns that are common to all the regional negotiations and I am following them very closely . #% Well may you shake your head , Mr Watson : it would be better if you apologised . #% The Commission understands public concern about the use of depleted uranium materials for military purposes . #% The rapporteur calls for the principle of proportionality to be observed , which makes it a source of particular regret that this principle was not respected in drawing up this report . #% The proposal will not force Member States to give legal recognition to unmarried partnerships , but if they do they must treat unmarried partners like spouses . #% That is a good balance . #% I hope we see full support in the vote two weeks from now . #% This is a pragmatic institution . #% Meanwhile , the official whose case is relevant to the specific question that the honourable Member asked was granted leave and permission to work for a company after he had signed a declaration that he was aware of his obligations under the Staff Regulations and would not disclose any confidential information to his employer . #% He is now negotiating it away without any promises on fundamental reform , which he said previously were vital . #% Instead of the UK Eurosceptics criticising this report , they should welcome it because it will do a lot to help our hard-pressed hauliers . #% Mr President , like other speakers in this debate , I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs . #% When I sought to exert my right as a parliamentarian to enter the building , I was physically prevented from doing so and a rather unedifying shoving and shouting match took place . #% Madam President , over the last few years we have actually seen some very real beacons of hope in Africa . #% The issue itself continues , as the Commissioner and Members know . #% We have made it clear that we do believe in human rights . #% Large enterprises can build complex websites in different languages , based in different countries , but we want to allow small enterprises with an innovative and exciting product and service based in one EU country to be able to access that EU market freely and simply , to take real advantage of the powers that e-commerce offers them . #% I can say these things with certainty because I have been looking back at the evaluation of the third-sector initiative which ran from 1997 to 1998 , thanks to a budgetary initiative by Mrs Ghilardotti , who is here tonight . #% The report and the underlying regulation seek to establish clearer and more transparent rules for state aid for employment . #% Until all Member States are able to assure us that there is full compliance , this proposal , if passed , will simply add to the list of laws which have not been implemented . #% The current situation in the Middle East represents a failure of diplomacy nearly a century ago . #% I hope it will stimulate the validation and development of alternative non-animal testing methods . #% For this reason we are obliged to abstain on the final vote . #% Are not Article 98 agreements in line with the spirit and letter of the Rome Treaty ? #% Following that bombshell , egg consumption in the UK fell by 60 % and the government embarked on what can only be described as knee-jerk reaction , when they slaughtered 2 million chickens . #% Has enough been done , in particular with regard to the issue of phosphates ? #% Also on this point , will the presidency confirm that under the Treaty it is the Fourteen - minus the country concerned - which would make a recommendation to suspend Austria from membership , should that be necessary ? #% Intelligent calls for more political integration , like that last week from the head of the German Bundesbank , really do not stand a chance . #% It is up to us all to keep this high on the political agenda . #% I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes . #% A success story for them but hardly for Europe ! #% However , for a lot of Member States it was a major problem . #% I do not want to go into detail on many of the issues because I will leave that to both rapporteurs , who have mentioned several items . #% Lastly , conscious that we next have on the agenda a Commission statement on recent environmental disasters in southern Europe , I want to insist on the likely connection between this terrible season for Caribbean hurricanes , typhoons in the South China Sea and indeed the wettest summer in Britain for 40 years , and the effects of climate change and global warming . #% The first is that , alongside the liberalisation debates , we very much welcome the key decisions reached in Barcelona to guarantee high-quality public services in the European Union as a fundamental guarantee for citizens , and in the interests of territorial and social cohesion . #% 
How can I defend a situation where a combination of continental MEPs press for changes that will supply an imperative to British local authorities that a majority of British MEPs have not voted for ? #% I do not believe that the time is yet right for a full Parliamentary Assembly at global level . #% Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Commissioner Kinnock on his second term of office , which I am sure will be even more distinguished than his first . #% The European Union is one of the few bodies to have formal relations with this country and must use its leverage and access to its government to resolve this situation satisfactorily . #% Does Mr Santer not consider that the cancellation of debt - and here I am talking about the interest upon the interest upon the interest - could be the single best contribution we could make to the developing world ? #% If it goes through , I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better . #% As demonstrated during the foot-and-mouth crisis in our country , agriculture is an integral part of the rural economy . #% I object to the concept that British nationals are assumed to be in favour of all this power theft , without being allowed to vote on the subject . #% All this rings alarm bells for me . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Lamy for his presentation . #% Madam President , I welcome the Commissioner ' s statement that he is in listening mode . #% Parliament , at second reading , proposed a change to the commitology arrangements but , in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam , I have not recommended that those amendments be supported . #% This was agreed by the Committee on International Trade . #% Hopefully those problems will be solved and we should not be in that situation for next year . #% Instead of building divisions into the western alliance , both the North Americans and like-minded Europeans must make the necessary political and material commitments to revitalise NATO as the primary instrument of western security . #% As regards the detailed response that is justified to the question on health problems , there is a great deal of material at the Commission and certainly I , or indeed my responsible colleagues , would be happy to give full details to the honourable Member of whatever is at their disposal . #% Where are the wide criticisms of the SCF opinion ? #% However , because there are references to the Lisbon Treaty which we could not specifically vote against , we have decided to abstain on the final vote . #% In the absence of any such provisions , cross-border transportation of mortal remains is governed by two instruments of international law , but primarily the Strasbourg agreement concluded in 1973 . #% We need to rebuild the trust in , and value of , this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes , whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use . #% As the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out , the sins that have been committed in the past need to be avoided in the future . #% Mario Calderón and Elsa Constanza Alvarado were killed as members of the human rights organization CINEP , which is committed to defending human beings against violence and terror and working for peace . #% The European Parliament has to help ensure that Bangladesh is not exploited by the big multinational companies , that it is able to use its reserves properly and to sell them at the most competitive price , which may not mean just to India or to Russia . #% Recently I called for meetings of the Council to be held in public when it is operating in a legislative capacity . #% So , his initial request for six temporary staff was one that , at the very least , merited full consideration and a meaningful dialogue . #% Once this money is added to the ninth EDF , the figures touted by the Council are comparable only in nominal terms . #% Given that we do not know exactly what the route of transmission is -- if there is a route to humans -- and that consumers are wary of food of unknown origin at such a time , would the Commission consider providing consumers with extra information via the labelling of the country of origin of the poultry meat component of composite foods which account for a very large section of the European Union market ? #% I have one criticism of what he has just said - and here we will have to agree to disagree . #% I apologize for speaking primarily about the situation in Great Britain . #% The committee supported my recommendations on that and the amendments are up for vote tomorrow . #% What is being done about all this ? #% Now let me detail the points that still separate us . #% I commend Mr Paasilinna 's report to this House . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work . #% Nevertheless , it is right that the sanctions regime should be reviewed and that they should be focused more precisely . #% The British Conservative Delegation is particularly keen to protect children and their rights , and the standards which are applied in the UK are generally very high . #% Commissioner Kinnock called this a symbolic fine . #% We shall continue to put pressure on our government to concede a referendum . #% While we support a robust NPT and steps to curtail the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran , we have abstained on this resolution because we are not in agreement with the following paragraphs in particular : #% One of the problems we have in the European Union is that animals in the very far north , for example , are not necessarily the same as animals in the south . #% The ongoing terrorist campaign in Iraq , of course , still poses a serious threat to stability in the region . #% The situation would also be helped by agreement between the Sri Lankan political parties themselves and we welcome the efforts of the Norwegian and other governments and feel that the Commonwealth could have a very valuable role to play in this situation . #% We believe that the term `` constituency weeks '' was an unfortunate one . #% In the wake of the BSE crisis we must make it simple for people to identify the safest beef available , which is , of course , British . #% We sincerely hope that this is to the benefit of British farmers . #% France and the Netherlands should not be asked to vote on it again , and the Dutch Prime Minister 's remarks should be taken very seriously . #% This agreement also provides more choice of pension funds because it opens up the European market in investment management and pension administration . #% Let me refer to one individual , because this is what human rights are about : the rights of individuals . #% Mr Dupuis is right . #% I would very much have liked to have spoken on that particular position yesterday . #% For many years he was a Communist apparatchik , a friend of Mr Kádár , the dictator in Hungary , and an outspoken opponent of the values that we hold dear in the West . #% We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year . #% Our children are our most vulnerable citizens and we should make every effort possible to protect them . #% Mr President , as Mr Pirker pointed out I had the honour to lead the European Parliament 's delegation to the ASEP II meeting in the Philippines last week . #% Why not involve the public as well ? #% Mrs Starmer won at a tribunal on the basis of legislation , and nobody knows when they get on a plane whether the pilot is actually competent to fly that aeroplane , or somebody who is a young mum just having fun . #% That would deal with these difficulties . #% I wish to thank my friend , the Commissioner , whom I have always found very helpful . #% Mr President , the Commission has an important role to play in this matter . #% I also welcome moves improving Article 6 of that directive so as to achieve a more even regulatory framework across Member States through the requirement for cooperation and coordination between NRAs and the Commission . #% It always comes as a great inspiration to hear from them that , even in the darkest hours , in the deepest jails and in the worst conditions , they had their spirits lifted by messages from outside . #% The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now . #% Doing nothing is not an alternative either because that would bring no pressure to bear on anyone to seek alternatives . #% Thank you for the reply , Commissioner , which sounds encouraging . #% If so , she will not only make me happier , but a lot of young people happier too . #% However we can not allow Russia to bully its neighbours and use its hydrocarbon resources as a diplomatic weapon . #% 
Is he aware , for example , of the request from 37 million disabled people in Europe and many outside our borders that the United Nations should enforce better rights for disabled people ? #% As my colleague has said , it is time for a change . #% He could even look at the Single Programming Documents in order to do this . #% The future of the people of Darfur is now in the balance , just as much as it was before the agreement on maintaining the AU force until 30 September 2006 . #% Our Group , the Verts/ALE , cancertainly go along with that , with the proviso that we believe we need to be very careful that these compliance time gaps between older and newer Member States begin to start closing afterwards . #% Quite simply , I say , let us stop the talk and sort it out , because if we do not , we demean ourselves and degrade the process of which we are part . #% Let me take the example that has come up recently of the self-regulation on pedestrian safety , where the Commission has made a deal with the automobile industry . #% Mr Blair constantly preached the virtues of more openness during his Presidency and we got a specific agreement that we would get openness in relation to Council meetings and Council processes . #% That issue was not resolved at Doha and has been referred to the TRIPS Council . #% I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to the fact that these aid workers , both European and Afghans , may face the death penalty under Taliban law . #% Mr President , I really must congratulate my colleague , Sir Robert Atkins of the British Conservative Party , on his most excellent report on the Single European Sky . #% Support , because job creation and an end to the scourge of unemployment must be the first priority of our Structural Fund programmes ; support , because people living in our coal-mining , textile , steel and defence regions did not ask for the economic shock waves that have taken the heart out of their communities and no one can ask them to rebuild their economies without public support ; and support , because this ECU 9bn of expenditure - more than # 7m - represents the people 's priorities on how European money should be spent . #% This is partly occasioned by the fact that the statements by the two German Ministers took up some 50 minutes . #% We have to admit that at the moment we have a passive welfare state rather than an active payment system which encourages people to get into employment within the European Union . #% We believe this approach should involve an ` entry strategy ' into the labour market , which should form an integral part of the 2020 strategy and constitute its roadmap for the years up to 2015 . #% They contain no binding enforceable obligations for corporate conduct and the level of liberalization required would be inappropriate for developing countries . #% I agree with everything that has been said about reform . #% I and my British Conservative colleagues support the President of the Commission 's call for a renewed focus in achieving effective economic reform through the revised Lisbon Agenda which we believe must focus on stimulating growth and competitiveness in Europe leading to more employment . #% We give them credit for what they have done already and we pledge support for future efforts . #% Members of the trade unions are with us today in the gallery . #% If the Pérez Royo report deals with the near future , Mr Stevens ' essay on electronic money treats of a future which is fast moving towards us . #% As far as the Commission 's proposal is concerned , this is simply reinventing the wheel , putting the political ambitions of the European Union before the needs of suffering people . #% As we know , Member States all too often agree to what should be legally-binding targets in the certain knowledge that the pathetically cumbersome enforcement procedures that the Commission has at its disposal will mean that they never actually have to meet those targets within anything like the timescales proposed . #% But it is not appropriate either to stipulate that the penalty in connection with trafficking must be a prison sentence or to lay down minimum penalties . #% However , the proposals being discussed from the recent negotiations perpetuate an imbalance favouring the United States . #% I salute Mr Schmidt . #% ` We denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the Commission , who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers ' contracts . #% Bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding , whilst a simple manual swing-over ramp , built into the floor of each new bus , is cheap and will work time after time . #% What we really need is a system whereby each Member State is asked at a Council meeting whether or not it can comply with the legislation that its ministers are about to sign up to . #% Mr President , with regret I have to inform the House of the arrest yesterday in Moscow of Vladimir Alexandrovich Gusinsky , chief executive of the Most-Media group of television , radio and newspaper outlets . #% I conclude by confirming that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market will continue to press vigorously for the speedy completion of the internal market . #% Mr President , one of the reasons that I was motivated to suggest this oral amendment which brings the three together is that in the English text , the Socialist amendment does not read very well . #% Nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country . #% We can not afford not to address these issues . #% Thereafter , after 2005 , the cost will actually decrease , leading to permanent savings of EUR 23.5 million by comparison with 2001 . #% In that sense , we all have to recognise how small a part we play in the bigger overall process . #% For example , the General Affairs Council on 19 March decided once again not to table a critical motion in the United Nations sub-committee in Geneva , dealing with human rights abuses in China . #% They now have a tremendous fear of future WTO rulings . #% . The British Conservative delegation strongly supports genuine human rights and the need for the UN Commission on Human Rights to take a robust position to overcome abuses in many parts of the world . #% I would like the Commissioner to say whether she is going to look again at whether all clubs could be treated on the same level . #% I am sure , Mr Vitorino , you share with us the desire to make certain that there is justice in this enlarged Europe . #% I am perfectly prepared for each country to continue with the system it prefers . #% Mr President , I had the privilege of representing this House at the funeral of Yasser Arafat . #% People who are free , and free to travel , tend to be committed to peaceful solutions and less prey to introverted nationalism which is a security threat . #% It may also ensure that gender equality becomes an isolated backwater rather than the highly visible flag-carrier that its supporters want . #% We really have to think of the cost to the common agricultural policy in our negotiations . #% I commend the Roth-Behrendt report to you . #% I earnestly hope that colleagues from all sides of the House , and indeed the Commissioner , will reflect on this when we are voting on the Atypical Workers Directive in a few weeks time . #% Also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English , that is quite a meaningless term . #% Secondly , on the question of banking charges , what has been the response of the banking community thus far ? #% What about the economic criteria in the Copenhagen Declaration of June 1993 ? #% That is why it is simply not good enough that the Commission responded to a written question of mine last November , simply saying that this type of technology needs to be used with caution . #% A number of colleagues are having to leave at unearthly hours because they have to make different travel arrangements and , consequently , will not be able to participate in all the votes . #% Mr Clark , a British national , found that he could bring his Russian wife into Germany but not Britain - unless he lived for six months in Germany first . #% Is the Commissioner confident that the Mediterranean driftnet fleets will also disappear and that we will no longer have driftnet fishing in the Mediterranean , from EU waters , as we will now in the Atlantic . #% We have learned over the past 15 years that progress in liberalisation can not be achieved all at once and a step-by-step approach is more likely to lead to a better outcome in the end . #% We hope that Commissioner Fischler sticks to his guns , and pushes ahead with his plans in Luxembourg next week . #% The international community must take access to water much more seriously before it is too late . #% The Commission text clearly covered privatised utilities . #% Finally , I would like to ask whether we might have some consistency from the Commission . #% But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report , and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that . #% And , of course , this is also , for many people , a fixed income , an essential guarantee . #% You might think I am making it all up , but just last week President Barroso said : ` As a prime minister I was in favour of a referendum [ on the Constitution ] ' . #% However , we should signal our intent to them , and we do so by seeking to amend the resolution to replace the wording calling accession in 2007 ` impossible ' in paragraph 1 . #% We are told that the Council will not accept EUR 83 million per year for six years , but EUR 63 million per year is what was being spent under the old programme . #% China and India can force these issues onto the agenda and the fact that the European Union has more votes in the IMF than the United States suggests that the World Social Forum slogan ` Another world is possible ' is achievable : with sufficient willpower and political commitment . #% 
I simply ask for an authoritative answer - yes or no . #% The sad fact is that the railways have lost ground even where there are well placed , for example , in long distance freight . #% As far as the response to Parliament and the Council is concerned , I respect it . #% Finally on the legal base issue , I shall be supporting the rapporteur and the Socialist Group on a legal base , but we have to bang heads together on this issue of Articles 175 and 95 because we have kept coming up against this issue in environmental legislation over the past few months . #% President , this Friday , 5 December 2003 , the parliamentary members of the Convention will meet up again to consider the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference , to speak with Mr Frattini and Mr Giscard d’Estaing , and to make joint proposals to the IGC . #% If we are serious about promoting research in the European Union , if we are serious about promoting the economy of European Union Member States , then we should not support these backward-looking amendments that seek to restrict research in this way . #% Finally , will the Commission work with drug companies to bring down the prices of drugs under certain licensing agreements , because this is clearly critical to any methods we use to tackling the spread of HIV and Aids ? #% We believe it does a singular service by demonstrating to the Commission and the Member States the scale of public exasperation at the delays in phasing out live animal testing for cosmetic products . #% It is a serious problem and I hope the European Commission will look into how it can help to fund hospitals and outreach programmes for women affected by it . #% Amendment 3 concerns taking possession of the delivery of guidelines by national parliaments , social partners , NGOs , and local and regional authorities . #% As the Commissioner said earlier , this is an issue on which I and other Members have worked in connection with the electronics communications package . #% Huge numbers of people - particularly the indigenous populations - are grossly afflicted by poverty . #% Were extraordinary renditions discussed ? #% I would ask fellow Members , when considering the latest raft of telecoms measures in the weeks to come , not to allow this to go unnoticed or for that matter unchallenged . #% I have to say that if they fail in their endeavours , I am sure Parliament will feel obliged to act on their behalf . #% On this and all the issues identified in this report , human rights are indivisible within Europe as well as elsewhere in the world . #% He is familiar with the background to this case and has been good enough to accept the accuracy of the description that has been provided to him in this House . #% On this , are our hands clean ? #% However , the wider definition of family will not be welcomed by all , and I do not share the UK Government 's - my own Labour Government 's - analysis of this directive . #% Will the Commission therefore commit itself to subordinate further extension of the system to the completion of the reforms that Commissioner Monti referred to ? #% People want a better life and now believe that it is achievable . #% Such statements damage the relationship between politicians and the people , and if ever there was a time for politicians to demonstrate that they are listening , it is now . #% Block No 1 will effectively subsume three other amendments . #% I thank you , Commissioner Monti . #% This directive , as amended , is more likely , in my view , to be a barrier to employee involvement than a bridge . #% I say to the Commissioner that we do not expect this to be done as an after-thought , after all the departments in the Commission have developed legislation . #% If I am a Labour MEP who has brought legislation in , I am very proud to do that because we may see a reduction of accidents in the workplace as a result of such legislation . #% In Scandinavia , for example , domestic heating must be more expensive for all income groups than in southern Europe . #% We have to bear in mind that what we are creating here is an optional scheme for companies and financial service providers to take advantage of if they want to . #% You can count on large parts of this Parliament to give you robust support when arguing against those who may wish to confine the round to no more than a narrow series of sector-specific commercial trade-offs . #% It is a very timely and well-produced report on what , as has already been said , is a very complex and sensitive issue . #% He was right to bolster consumer access to information , ensuring that full lists of substances added to detergents are readily accessible to consumers . #% The Commission has a seat on the Board and , under this proposal , would acquire voting rights as well . #% It is not a question of international trade , it is a question of internal demand . #% It was for this reason that it threw out at first reading the superfluous requirements about maturation times , much as chefs might have wanted them , and category of animal , which did nothing for traceability , added cost , and increased the disaffection of many Member States and of those who will have to implement this proposal . #% A fundamental flaw in his analysis leads us to conclude that the rapporteur 's conclusions are wrong . #% This is something we really need to ask the Commission to consider . #% The arts , music , literature and the sciences became vibrant and spawned countless works which enrich us still today . #% What are Saddam Hussein 's genocidal acts ? #% I notice , for instance , that the EPP Group has over 100 amendments in its name but signed by 18 different Members , none of them the coordinator or leader of the group . #% I support what the rapporteur and his party colleagues say in condemning human rights abuse in Cuba , but I call on them to be consistent including , yes , in Colombia , where the Organization of American States has already said that supposedly demobilised paramilitaries are returning to arms . #% In consumer terms , cross-border complaints are plainly now the main item on the increase . #% The resulting ban on other phthalates had nothing whatsoever to do with children 's toys or teething rings . #% We appreciate the motivation , but we do not think this is the right place to do that . #% So I thought ` ah , the secrecy is because there is going to be some big announcement ' . #% I keep hearing people talking about the 're - unification ' of Europe and I wonder to which particular model they are referring . #% On that basis , I commend my report to the House . #% This may permit Members to ask more questions and , I hope , receive more answers . #% They were not talking about an effective policy and were not concerned about the effectiveness of its outcome . #% It is obvious why it is the case but there is no need to link a new own resources system with Agenda 2000 and I hope that if that is a problem then we can get an agreement on Agenda 2000 and afterwards continue to look at future financing . #% Mr Heath 's pigeons of the 1970s have come home to roost big time in the UK . #% The young people and the others who look down on the Chamber today wonder what we talk about . #% As rapporteur , I still am not aware of anything having been received by Parliament , although I am assured by Mr Bolkestein 's services that his letter is in the post . #% By allowing issuers to choose between their regulatory authorities , largely as they do now , for example , on all securities except equities in a domestic market , we can ensure that that cooperation proceeds and that we gradually put in place the foundation for a single regulatory authority across the Union . #% I believe that the issue of whom to allow into the United Kingdom should be the responsibility of elected parliamentarians and accountable ministers in the United Kingdom , not the responsibility of the EU . #% Is pushing up the prices of shoes from China and Vietnam really going to help European producers , or will it simply force retailers to source their shoes from other non-EU markets , such as India ? #% I look forward to the day when Romanian colleagues are in this Chamber as elected Members of this European Parliament . #% Mr President , much has been said of the evil and immoral behaviour of Saddam Hussein and rightly so , but I want to focus on the European Union and indeed on one Member State in particular , my own , the United Kingdom . #% The Doorn report has a special focus on the use of impact assessments . #% We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible . #% I would ask , Mr President , if we could do something . #% Similar thinking instructed my delegation 's decision to vote against Mr Martínez Martínez 's other report on structural measures . #% Amendment No 394 was tabled by a colleague of mine , Mrs Scallon . #% Mr Schmitt said , and I wholeheartedly agree with him , that Member States have to do more to address the root causes that are forcing people to migrate across Europe and across the world , but it is not easy to address the root causes in the countries from where many asylum seekers come . #% We also endorse , incidentally , the proposed 20 % entry into reserve pending the successful outcome of our discussions over the guidelines . #% As the Commissioner said , 14 years on from the start of these human rights agreements being included , it is time for a fresh look . #% 
First of all , on the assumption that we agree that drinking milk should be included , it is obviously extremely important that the traditional bottle sizes in which milk is delivered in the UK are fully protected . #% You see them all over the place , you see them in America . #% We very much support the ban on the use of catering waste in animal feed , not least because the likely cause of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom was the use of pigswill as feed . #% Are the measures for the implementation of smart sanctions now in place ? #% Membership of the Single Market , the largest trading bloc in the world , is crucial for jobs in the north-west . #% This is what Mr Elles was touching on and I am trying to be more subtle by saying that what we need to be doing is looking now at what the needs of enlargement are , and once again talking with the other institutions to look at a revision for enlargement . #% If we do not vote for the compromise in Amendment No 11 , I believe that the harvest across the whole of the EU will not be able to take place . #% We have to support the UN Secretary General in his mission . #% Mr President , last Friday Mr Eric Tabarly , a very distinguished French yachtsman , was knocked overboard in heavy seas off the Welsh coast and is missing , presumed drowned . #% They will exploit our weaknesses and our citizens will suffer as a result . #% in writing . - In light of the fact that the World Health Organisation maintains that ` no solid evidence exists to be able to say that adding DHA to infant formula will have important clinical benefits ' , I chose to vote against allowing companies to make unsubstantiated claims about the health benefits of DHA . #% I suggest to him that they are premature and I would ask the Commission to reject them . #% Parliament can then make all of the political points that it needs to make . #% Such inaction actually endorses these attacks upon minorities . #% We are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme that makes the choice a reality . #% That is why , as the Commissioner said , it is so important for the Employment Directive 2000 to be implemented equally across the EU . #% We are not talking about any particular type of partnership - that in itself would be discrimination - but recognising stable partnerships . #% As spokesman for my Conservative delegation on research , I share the view of Ms Lynne that we should like to see chronic diseases more strongly prioritised in the EU 's framework research programmes . #% Nonetheless , with the outcome of this procedure on this side of the House we are confident that we have a Commission that is a distinct improvement on the previous one . #% So , Commissioner , a sincere thank you from a lot of us , for pushing this forward . #% I have already advised the chairman of the Merchant Navy Association -- a captain in the Merchant Navy in his own right -- that should this come into force , it should be disregarded and the European flag thrown overboard . #% How can we believe that it is possible for Europe to meet its Millennium Development Goal targets if resources are to be limited for those critical years up to 2013 ? #% As Mr Mantovani said , the level of unemployment is three times higher for disabled people . #% It is important that these commitments are realised and that they do not simply turn into hot air . #% We need good effective policing with the consent of the communities . #% Mr President , this morning the press tells us that you complained that you had to get up at 4 a.m. in order to get to Strasbourg to do business here . #% Is there a procedural expectation that all eleven will vote the same way in the formal decision-making in Ecofin ? #% At the moment Mugabe thinks he is untouchable and even flies to Spain for medical treatment . #% This is demonstrated most clearly in the reaffirmation of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie and the death sentence by stoning on the German businessman , Helmut Hofer , which has already been referred to by many Members in this House . #% There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them . #% For a long time the Cuban Government has been able to blame all the country 's woes on the American embargo . #% What we are really looking for here is that the persons concerned should be afforded the necessary support , if required , in terms of sustenance , in terms of medical assistance , should that be necessary when they transit through airports on their way to their destination . #% My group will therefore be voting against most amendments that advocate this principle and in support of the rapporteur 's position . #% Mr President , I can allay the fears of colleagues : Mrs Frassoni was mixing up committees of inquiry and temporary committees . #% We have made some worthwhile improvements , but the fundamentals of what you proposed have been left unaltered . #% I made the comments about Mr Barrot having researched the case very carefully . #% These are not circular letters that they have just signed , they are letters that they have written themselves . #% The third point is that it provides for type-approval to be extended in cases where motor vehicles are fitted , after they have been built , with additional fuel tanks for additional fuels or additional larger tanks . #% It is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the European Parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society , or not , as the case may be . #% That is the reality and that is why we need a new approach . #% - I welcome my Socialist colleague , Willi Rothley 's recommendation on protecting motorists abroad . #% That is why our Group supports positive action and only when women are fairly represented in positions of decision making will men also be fairly represented . #% In my view , there are other models of liberalization that do not include privatization . #% Consider this situation : you are in a supermarket looking at hundreds of bottles of wine . #% A European president and foreign minister , a European public prosecutor , diplomatic service , space policy , a European Defence Agency and Rapid Reaction Force , a Fundamental Rights Agency to enforce a charter that now has no standing , a police force and a European asylum and immigration policy . #% In all of these respects - objective measures of transparency - the ECB lags behind normal international practice . #% I think that there can be a stronger voice . #% Is turning our businessmen into criminals really what European unity is really all about ? #% The British people have not had a say on this , despite being promised it , and until we get a referendum on this , I will refuse to recognise the legitimacy of this Treaty . #% That means working in colleges , schools , the voluntary sector , across business networks and elsewhere , and increasing awareness amongst our population . #% In particular , the harmful impact of bad landfill practices on groundwater resources and on global warming by the emission of methane from landfills is , in itself , a very good and strong reason why we need to take the actions that we are proposing in this proposal . #% Commissioner Patten has repeatedly contacted the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe by telephone encouraging him to find a way to return to constructive and functional co-habitation with President Kumaratunga . #% We recognise the very real challenges that Pakistan faces , not least in the very hard task of facing terrorism on its own territory . #% Certainly the revolution has had achievements , but the economic , as well as the political , costs have been very high . #% Such posturing is all the more bewildering given that we will vote on this opinion only hours before the European Council formally agrees the Treaty change . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome Mr Sterckx 's report which , in our view , is comprehensive and highlights the catalogue of decisions that culminated in the Prestige disaster . #% In order to achieve this , we believe that the scope of the IGC should be restricted to `` tidying up '' the outstanding points from Amsterdam , plus a small range of other issues . #% The good thing now in the European Union is that we try to work together to improve society . #% Those tasks are essential to your economic wellbeing and to your country 's economic growth . #% Because of this , it is so important that we actually make sure that the game of football and other sports are regulated properly and that we do now take the action which has been discussed for so long about players ' agents . #% I ask the Commission to ensure that we have that information so that in future we as the budgetary authority can press for more funding for this very important work . #% Are the PPE Group and the British Conservatives really going to vote for that ? #% The producers of these substances should , within the framework of the directive , be able to market different products and compete in a free and fair manner , but also in a safe manner and one which respects the environment . #% The other point I would highly commend her for is the incorporation in paragraph 9 of her report of the response to the challenge laid down by Commissioner Liikanen some two years ago about the policies of critical mass . #% I would urge him to go back and see what more can be done . #% I say this to Egypt , and I say it as a friend : the litmus test of any civilised society is how it treats its minorities . #% 
Despite the pre-summit hype in the run-up to Barcelona , which suggested that the agenda would be considerably skewed in favour of neo-liberalism and structural reform , the outcome maintains the essentials of the policy mix established at Lisbon , namely mutually supported economic reform , full employment , social cohesion and , from Gothenburg , the issue of sustainable development . #% I do not think any of us can imagine why he is being held . #% Fourth , Taoiseach , allow me take you down a long lane in the county of Meath , to a small business situated there which is known as the Food and Veterinary Office . #% Unlike some of my colleagues I did not expect too much from the Commissioner 's statement at this point . #% Thus , multinationals in these countries will follow their usual routes of putting profit first and the interests of the ACP will never figure in their calculations . #% It was a perfectly proper debate . #% You have had correspondence , I know , from the World Health Organization and others who have made it absolutely clear that one of their major priorities is to have major programmes on the days of vaccination that you have referred to . #% Colleagues were talking about priorities . #% Finally , as the Commissioner said , we want engagement and partnership , not confrontation and containment . #% The captain was given permission to proceed to the Indonesian port of Merak , after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards Australian waters . #% This has my full support and I hope that we can implement this scheme as quickly as possible . #% In reality , I do not think I have ever seen a closed system myself in any factory anywhere where cement does not leak , squeeze or squirt out somewhere in the system and come into contact with workers on a fairly regular basis . #% As I read my Bible each day one of the things I have found out is that so much of what appears in the Bible coincides with common sense . #% For example , British pensioners retiring to Spain and others travelling from one country to another for work must be freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive red tape . #% It should recognise key gaps , such as the transfer of small arms to non-state actors and , ultimately , ways of reducing the demand for small arms . #% I am afraid that we could enter the year of enlargement - the year of European elections - with no European Youth Orchestra and no European television . #% In Britain , at least , people are waking up . #% Speaking in a personal capacity , we could manage within the 1 % if those same Member States had not already agreed that agricultural expenditure should be set in concrete up to 2013 . #% The question , therefore , is what can be done to help and what should not be done . #% Lastly my group agrees with the referral back to committee of Mrs Klamt 's report , for the reasons she gave . #% Finally , there are certain difficulties for the British Labour Members in relation to these reports , and we will have to await the outcome of the vote on the various amendments before deciding whether we can or not support them , or whether we may have to abstain . #% The demand for electricity - a commodity that can not be stored - peaks . #% Therefore we will find those people will be disenfranchised and that is becoming a greater problem as the European Union enlarges . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the frozen conflict over Western Sahara is destabilising the surrounding region . #% As a former mining engineer , energy policy has been one of my prime interests , so I am happy to be making my swan-song on an energy subject . #% If you add all the referendums together , more people voted ` yes ' than voted ` no ' . #% Therefore , it would not count as part of the relevant budget item . #% We will not be required to decide until April of next year after full and due deliberation . #% Although it may appear to be rather obscure , all the measures which are being changed today in our debate and in our vote will help to protect the general public and to make sure that their savings are safe . #% We wanted the Council to work not on the basis of competing drafts put forward by different Member States , but on a common proposal drawn up by an institution that belongs to all of us -- the Commission -- and that is duty bound to serve the interests of all Member States in the proposals that it brings forward . #% There are now over twenty of these deals in place . #% This again will mean increased cost to the consumer and industry alike . #% If they do , then that ends the matter until 4.45 p.m. #% Mr President , I was scheduled yesterday to speak in the debate on the media but , unfortunately , because of problems getting to Strasbourg , I was unable to make my timeslot . #% Mr President , I would like to say to the Commission and Parliament that I fully support what CITES is doing . #% Do we really want to introduce the first ever European regulation of the press ? #% We strongly reject the idea of breaches of animal welfare legislation because there have been no prosecutions as a result of investigations of those claims . #% Some people are saying : ' The IGC will never agree to this point or to that point ' . #% Past experience on previous directives shows that a foot in the door can and does lead to more opening than expected . #% In this Parliament we frequently complain that we are unfairly perceived as immature and irresponsible , and hence disregarded . #% It is right that there should be fresh measures in our counter-terrorist inventory in order to deal with an ever-changing threat and that these measures should be part of a seamless strategy . #% Firstly , the report promises to maintain a strongly-funded cohesion policy , whereas we believe that the cohesion and social funds should not be ring-fenced , and that the EU should rather concentrate spending on the new challenges it faces instead of old priorities such as cohesion policy . #% Under Rule 109 , if the President excludes a Member from the Chamber for disciplinary reasons , he or she is not allowed to return to the Chamber for the remainder of the sitting . #% Sadly , we who represent fishing communities around the North Sea - certainly those of us from Scotland - do not need to use our imaginations . #% That is why the United Kingdom car industry is doing relatively well . #% I am pleased that Mrs Sandbæk will accept that amendment . #% As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe , quiet diplomacy does not work . #% As we know , the restrictions concerning this regulation have caused us some problems : the fact that tax can not be tackled within it raises particular problems for some cross-border workers , especially as we see tax and social protection systems increasingly interlocking in some Member States . #% As Mr Lambrias said , the common foreign and security policy has clearly failed in certain areas , such as former Yugoslavia , Albania and other areas of the world . #% It is decentralization which leads to better identification of need and support for smaller projects , with quicker funding availability than is possible in traditional programmes . #% If we failed to approve this today , we would be in the untenable situation that only MEPs would be above the law in this respect : a text that applies within the Council to politicians and officials alike , in the Commission to politicians and officials alike , would apply in Parliament only to our officials and not to Members of the European Parliament . #% I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Peijs as rapporteur on this report which , as Mrs Villiers has already outlined , has been extremely complicated . #% She wants to keep loss-making industries on life-support systems when we should be releasing the resources of labour and capital so that they can work in viable new enterprises . #% Could I ask that that ruling be adhered to ? #% I will be supporting the budget proposals for 2004 , but with a certain amount of reluctance , and I will certainly be supporting amendments to them . #% They are destroying any hope , any prospect for the local artisanal fishermen . #% We need to encourage those tiers of government to take possession of the guidelines and ensure their proper implementation . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur . #% Now the Commission has told us that it will also listen very carefully to Parliament and consult us before it withdraws proposals . #% That is why the decisions have been taken in category 4 , to try to ensure that there will be real dialogue with the Council to solve some of the political problems in that area . #% The Treaty of Rome says the Community exists for the well-being of its citizens . #% All of us here are protected -- we have organisations , trade unions and institutions that will return our bodies to where our families want them to be . #% It goes along with the Savings Tax Directive , which I hope will soon be adopted in Council . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , the UK should make its own laws , so I reject this proposal . #% At a time when there is increased pressure on the public purse in so many of our countries , too many officials in Member State governments see the question as one of competition between the development aid budgets in the European Union and the funds they themselves can disburse within the Member States . #% In order to pass its law , the Government will be forced to use a constitutional sledgehammer called the Parliament Act , which was not designed for this sort of purpose and , in the view of many constitutional lawyers , will be improperly used in this way . #% 
What the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes , not the underlying trends . #% If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives , if we want to face up to the challenges of globalisation , if we want growth and jobs and competitiveness and prosperity , then we have to start to dismantle the European social model . #% It is also vital for the framework to recognise the important risk mitigation role played by collateral , both financial and physical . #% You somewhat remind me of your mate Tony Blair . #% It is that end statistic which seems to be what everybody is interested in instead of all the work behind it . #% I would like the Council to enlighten us as to what kind of proposal that might be . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I tried to take the floor before we voted on that last vote . #% That said , I am not convinced that we have yet struck quite the right balance between flexibility and protection . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office on getting through so many answers in this Question Time . #% Mr President , I agree with many of the comments that have been made so far by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Maij-Weggen on the situation in Burma . #% The annual growth survey is indeed a frontal attack on long-established , socially and economically essential workers ' rights and on the very concept of collective bargaining . #% The second amendment concerns mercury-cell chlor-alkali plants . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for what seems to be a very satisfactory answer and to congratulate her on the newspapers she chooses to read , or rather chooses not to read . #% What I am proposing is something similar to what Senator Mitchell did in Northern Ireland . #% Throughout the discussions the ACP countries have made the case for a gradual price cut , an end to dumping and for additional long-term funding to help them deal with what is a drastic reform . #% And common sense it might be to the majority of people ; but not , I fear , to the delegates to this convention . #% I thank the Commission for its contribution and , indeed , each of the Members of the European Parliament who have spoken in this debate . #% Local fishermen and international environmental groups are pleading with the EBRD not to grant a loan of approximately EUR 300 million to finance the project . #% In preparing its proposals , the Commission is now committed to making impact assessments , but the environmental industries do not believe that these properly take account of the real stimulus to innovation derived from setting high environmental standards . #% The second area was export refunds , something on which Mr Mulder , the previous speaker , is an expert , as is Mr Casaca from the Socialist benches , and a subject I know very little about . #% This was a cause for great concern . #% Following meetings with Commissioner Špidla , we were told in 2008 that a proposal was being prepared by the Commission and we were on the brink of achieving this . #% No , we can not have Interpol ; we can not have normal extradition treaties between Member States ! #% Mr President , I too would like to repeat all the thanks that have been conveyed to all those involved in this excellent committee of inquiry , particularly the Chairperson , Mrs Redondo Jiménez , and Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , both of whom played exemplary roles in the whole process . #% So far as whistle-blowing is concerned , and as the honourable Member may know , we will be putting forward very comprehensive proposals for radical change in current arrangements which will , when they are implemented - hopefully with the assistance of this Parliament as a legislature - provide the European Union institutions with the best , fairest and most effective system for ensuring that the duty of officials to report their suspicions of wrong-doing will be fully accessible and made totally effective . #% One thing that we can do to help those countries would be to look again at our common agricultural policy - looking to reform that . #% The first one is the need to address , within the Union , the impact of legislation on business . #% My fear is that by eroding artistic freedoms , even slightly , we are also eroding the values of free speech and expression . #% in writing . - I am submitting an explanation of vote on the Auken report in support of three separate constituents who have contacted me pleading for help . #% Discussions on aviation relations with the United States meanwhile continued in the Council and in June 1996 the Commission was given a partial mandate for negotiating a common aviation area between the European Community and the USA . #% We need to be very careful in applying the principles of subsidiarity , a view which is being widely expressed across the Chamber . #% I would like to say to my friend Mr de Vries that you are right to raise the demon of nationalism , but this is ` pitch ' and you must be careful how you throw it around . #% This is a good basis on which we can build . #% That I can not do . #% It is also a question about democracy and participation and the feeling of being in control of either your workplace or indeed the company with which you are dealing . #% Then on the question of fair treatment I would like to stress in particular the use of the safe third country concept . #% I can only hope that in future we oppose those barbaric public spectacles in the same way we oppose China 's executions , as now modern technology allows public executions to be replaced by execution broadcast via mobile phone . #% This was originally carried by the committee in order to ensure the maintenance of high standards of probity and professional standards of the intermediaries , or brokers , as we call them in the UK . #% Mr President , I wish to draw the attention of the House to two matters being considered by the Committee on Petitions at the moment . #% Labour MEPs have been at the forefront of protecting consumers across Europe . #% We look to our societies and to our governments to act internationally to create a sustainable future so that we can change the situation of poverty in which many people live . #% Recital D stated ` whereas it is neither necessary nor desirable and practicable to harmonise the rules for financial participation schemes , as this would impede the flexibility of Member States ' policies ' . #% Mr President , first I would like to thank the Commissioners who willingly underwent the hearings process ; it was a gruelling experience for all concerned . #% That might have enabled the Commission to bring forward a proposal we could all agree with . #% The rapporteur , Mr Berenguer Fuster , supports me on both counts . #% To differentiate between the rights of those buying on line and those shopping in the high street would go against the valuable work that the European Parliament and the EU in general has already done in championing the rights of the citizens . #% A series of informal thematic meetings on specific issues in these categories is anticipated this year and next year . #% Now we demand real , lasting and effective action . #% I tend to be an optimist by nature , but I am a cautious optimist . #% Does he therefore not agree that it is highly irresponsible of the tobacco and alcohol industries to be lobbying the way they have and spending millions to try to have this decision reversed ? #% On the politics , I grant you : you have your big shiny buildings in Brussels , Strasbourg and Luxembourg , and you have managed to take over more than 75 % of the nation states ' ability to make the laws . #% We are told in the Commission proposal for the regulation that ` as evaluation before putting into effect is fundamental for Member States in order to gain mutual trust , it seems reasonable for this to remain the responsibility of Member States ' . #% Certainly , once the almost inevitable war is over , the US , through the Quartet , must show resolve for a road map solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and ensure a viable two-state solution . #% We need to help them develop their own fishing industries so that in the long run - and I emphasize the long run because it will be the long run - they are able to export their own fishing products and get the added value of their fishing industries for their own development . #% The no-fly zones have been effective in protecting the lives of at least some of those people but we should do more ; we must do more . #% In my country in particular , where the press often misportrays that reality , this step forward is important in underlining that democratic accountability . #% Of the living creatures , they can see many animals that are treated cruelly , rare ones becoming extinct for ever . #% They are a rather obvious category of people who might be inclined to do that . #% The United States and the Europeans must work in harmony and not allow themselves to be played off one against the other . #% There is no contradiction if we recognize the importance of the pharmaceutical industry for the health of our citizens and for our national social security systems . #% Therefore I look forward to the Commission using this report as the basis for bringing forward costed and workable proposals for action . #% Uninvited foreign regulations poured over the border attempting to change traditions and eliminate the country . #% The one positive innovation is that Rule 57 ( 6 ) has for the first time been implemented with the statement made by the President-in-Office which I like others welcome . #% Finally , smog . #% The keynote themes of the late and much mourned Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim included the demand for the full establishment of the rule of law and of the entrenchment of human rights in a federal constitution . #% She declined to do so . #% 
However -- and this was our central preoccupation -- the compilation of the CFR is a political exercise : it involves political choices . #% So say the UN special representative on human rights , the Mexican observer commission and the relations of ten fishermen killed in Santa Marta , and of the 18 people forced face down on to the ground and shot dead by paramilitaries in Buga within the last month alone . #% And I believe that openness should also extend to the applicant countries themselves . #% I question the morality of excluding Taiwan from the benefits that would undoubtedly accrue from being granted observer status at the World Health Assembly . #% I do not think that any of us know , because we are part of this vast experiment , how far the human metabolism has been changed by this whole range of new artificial products many of which bring great benefits , as salt of aspartame obviously does to Mr Bowis , but which could also cause concern . #% There are areas where I would hope we can get decisions on 19 July , which makes it worthwhile for me at least to go . #% Talk of expert groups must not be allowed to distract us from that . #% Therefore we have to have political agreement by the Vienna summit . #% Furthermore , if the courts can not deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied . #% We now have two blocks of amendments ; the first are those that I commend to this House , and the second those that are superseded by the first . #% The other press release mentions bullying . #% I am very happy for some of my colleagues who will follow in this debate to make those points . #% I particularly wish to support the importance of aiming at energy savings over efficiency : we want to use less fuel . #% But it is welcome that the Supreme Court has now said it would decide on whether the US courts have jurisdiction . #% In Europe we have experience of having to balance different legal traditions and practices and that is one reason we should be taking the lead in the future of regulation . #% Secondly , the ECB began to publish regular forecasts or , as they prefer to call them , `` projections '' in the December 2000 monthly bulletin , and that was a very welcome development . #% We were trying to make the point that if you want to create some monies in category 2 , you need our agreement , unless you want to take it from existing Structural Funds . #% As regards paragraph 5 concerning the accompanying explanatory statement , I am more than ready to make an oral amendment to my report that the explanatory statement , in accord with our usual practice , should not be included with the report . #% So instead of simply having an argument over a definition of what retailing might be , we look instead at the products and the kinds of trade which plainly are not in the static situation of even the corner shop itself . #% I am pleased that , at least as far as the speakers that have spoken until now are concerned , this should be something we can achieve today . #% Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians are really thirsty for information , particularly on the EDF and on following the EPA negotiations . #% In conclusion China should be told the EU is watching and , despite recent wobbles on human rights , will take effective action if human rights and international agreements are violated in Hong Kong . #% Mr President , this initiative aims to drive the European Union forward by propagating the Community method to develop European policies for European regions , rather than nations , and to establish a legal basis for new structural support for enlargement countries under the proposed constitution . #% I formally move that we postpone the vote until the Brussels part-session in two weeks ' time . #% Did I mishear that ? #% The Commission too often sees them as agencies for promoting and implementing its work . #% However , security is not just about money and , indeed , can not have a price put upon it . #% By their abusive hysteria about illegal immigrants and asylum seekers they demonise foreigners and generate more race tensions and suspicions . #% I do not have much time , so I shall not pursue all the issues of this particular directive . #% There are many international studies which have thrown up difficulties , however , when it comes to making straight comparisons , because of differences in curriculum , approach and the underlying assumptions about what constitutes a good education . #% The United Nations Environment Programme has said that this is clearly a crime , although they say they do not yet know who was responsible , or the actual nature of that crime . #% In fact , we spent up to the figure mentioned by Mr Prodi -- 1.15 % -- in 1993 . #% Apparently the whole world should know that he , as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council , ` calls upon the international community to provide protection for civilian lives in Gaza ' . #% It is time to engage and to help entrepreneurs in developing countries rather than to over-politicise the issue . #% That is what the points of single contact are all about . #% Regarding the Attwooll report on shark finning ( A5-0043 / 2003 ) I voted against Amendment No 13 which allows for shark fins and body parts to be landed separately . #% The cost of giving State aid to all of these new Member States will be astronomical . #% We can learn something from the comprehensive UNDP report written last year by Arabs , which states : ` Political participation in Arab countries remains weak , as manifested in the lack of genuine representative democracy and restrictions on liberties ' . #% We need to look at the same issue in terms of second-hand cars and cars which go across borders . #% We are talking about a minor degree of surface contamination , and I urge that we do not let this matter get out of proportion . #% I say to Mr Gahrton that the problem is not one of transparency in this case , it is of the deficiencies either of his hearing or his understanding . #% It is also important that the social partners at the European and enterprise level are fully involved and consulted and that all the potential beneficiaries , enterprises and trainers are aware of the possibilities so that they can themselves inform others . #% That will mean that in some areas for which my committee is responsible , we have a diminution of consumer protection and other issues , where we are effectively giving less and asking more . #% But the real meat of this is Recommendation No. 59 which urges strongly the appointment of a European public prosecutor , which urges strongly a European prosecution office with delegated public prosecutors in Member States to create `` an area of freedom , security and justice as laid down in the Treaty '' . #% What is the Commission going to do then ? #% British Conservatives are supportive of the UN in its many difficult tasks but not of EU military adventures . #% As Mrs Banotti and Mr Cashman have pointed out , this is an area that needs legislation and where , I believe , European action would be positively welcomed . #% I can not understand how Mrs Barthet-Mayer , who , I think is still with us at least in body if not in spirit and mind , can say that France has a good record on implementing the environmental impact assessment statement . #% I do not know how far we will get down this road . #% I would like to associate myself very fully indeed with the tone of this question , but I think that there are a number of points that flow from it , because the resources that it needs are not just at Commission level as you , Commissioner , pointed out . #% 31 % of Germans have never heard of the European Commission and 90 % of Spaniards do not know what the European Convention is ! #% On 29 July this year the Ombudsman wrote to this Parliament on an own-initiative inquiry on his part calling for a code of good administrative behaviour and asking for a response by 30 November . #% Then there are the diseases and disorders beyond the three priorities of TB , AIDS and malaria . #% But what if it were not very good ? #% It is like old Cold War warriors coming together again , trying to fight in a more globally warmed arena . #% Several amendments refer to the need for synergy between this measure and other Community programmes and initiatives . #% We have to go forward with it . #% In parenthesis I would add that this was long before the BSE crisis occurred . #% Given recent distressing media coverage of animals suffering stress and deliberate cruelty it is highly appropriate that this Parliament should insist today that the Commission and Member States take urgent and effective action . #% Yes , the report has been critical of the British Government and , yes , it has attacked it on many aspects , but if the government made mistakes we , as a committee , had to look into it . #% That is why we have European governance and why you are seeking to push through the institutional changes , choosing a different method . #% Some of us in the British Conservatives would rule it out in principle , others within the PPE-DE Group would like to keep the option open as a very long-term possibility . #% It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system . #% We see the US Congress now seeking to bar claims for habeas corpus and President Bush and his henchmen trying to stifle the McCain Amendment which would ban inhuman treatment of US detainees . #% On Monday , the President told this Parliament that the First World War , a war in which both of my grandfathers defended their country , was a civil war . #% Let no government now turn around to the Parliament and criticise us for being incapable of taking decisions , accuse us of being too slow in taking decisions , when the European Council offers us a spectacle like that , which indeed discredits the European Union in the eyes of its citizens . #% 
The financial markets are not keeping the pressure on us just because of high debt and deficit levels , President Barroso : they are also doing so because they want compensation for the risk of lending money to a project that seems incapable of reaching maturity or fulfilling its own destiny . #% Firstly , antibiotic-resistant genes must be phased out . #% The Commission 's intentions in drawing up plans to encourage Member States to introduce an EU minimum wage policy and set retirement mechanisms are going against the Treaties . #% Mr Heath lied through his teeth to persuade us to join . #% However , I would urge the Commission not to overreact . #% If I could turn to Kaliningrad , Mr Haarder mentioned negotiations with Russia . #% I have little doubt that the report will eventually pass through this place and find its way onto the statute books of every Member State . #% It is now some 150 years since refrigeration was introduced , which allowed beef from Argentina to be imported into Europe . #% This is an absolute priority : the building of a peaceful society . #% I would like to ask the Commission why there have been such delays and overspending . #% It is also very important for us to emphasise the need to support domestic observer teams . #% Like my colleague , Mr Jarzembowski , I am chiefly concerned about aviation and the mostly ordinary people who rely on it . #% I wanted to raise this point yesterday , but you did not authorise me to intervene . #% The amendments tabled by the committee and the rapporteur do not really add up to anything of substance and , where they do , the results would probably be to damage the chances of success of the Environmental Action Programme . #% Mr President , I may not look like Mr Schulz but I am deputising for him . #% I also see great strength for creditors in Amendments Nos 3 , 5 and 6 while recognising that other national delegations , especially in my group , may have other concerns in this area . #% Parliament too , in the Budgets Committee , will approve the decision to grant the Commission 35 additional posts to assist with the reorganization of DG XXIV and to improve coordination with scientific committees and in the meantime , thirdly , to ensure sounder and more efficient management . #% If we can find a solution , we can help the people of the DPRK to help themselves with food aid and assistance in restarting and rebuilding agriculture , mining and non-nuclear energy projects . #% This is not satisfactory and I hope it will be dealt with during Mr Patten 's visit . #% I would like your assurance that the new team that comes in has those skills and also , and this is particularly important , that it also has a commitment to developing team-work in the Commission . #% The fact remains , however , that the Commission , acting on behalf of the Union , is probably the lead actor in all the activities to improve conditions of public health and to provide for decontamination and environmental protection . #% There is an absolute prohibition on torture under international human rights instruments . #% There is now a clear need to update current legislation to reflect new advances and our recent experiences in Europe and beyond , and I support the Commission 's attempt to do this . #% Article 130x of the Treaty is not being upheld . #% Yet even the best suffer fatigue and it became clear in November , as the Kashmiris faced a second wave of deaths from disease and exposure , that the donor community can not be relied upon to respond decisively where political will is lacking . #% This is a chance for our leadership to grow the European polity . #% I understand , Madam President , that there was one speaker in favour of the suggestion , and another speaker , who has just resumed her seat , putting forward the idea that there should be a debate on this matter at the end of this month in the second October part-session . #% That quite clearly is a way of long-term planning which is very sensible at this stage of Parliament 's life . #% Lastly , I welcome the nuanced approach that the report takes vis-à-vis mitigating circumstances . #% They argue that the precautionary principle is being applied more on emotional than on scientific grounds , that harmful links have not been indisputably established and that this is an inappropriate basis for making legislation . #% I would certainly hope that we take Mrs Ahern 's point very seriously and make it clear to the British Charities Commission and the genetic engineering lobby that we in this House will not be bullied in this way . #% This is a matter which the Committee on Petitions has under consideration . #% In this spirit , we welcome the Commission proposals and look forward to a speedy confirmation of the protocol to enable such cooperation to start at Community level , in addition to existing bilateral initiatives by individual Member States . #% I recommend that we look at taking the food distribution of the `` oil for food programme '' out of his hands , that we look at tearing down those dams that have wrecked the marshes and that we work to set up a criminal court where he can be tried at least in abstentia . #% Unless the European Union is prepared to take clear initiatives to revitalize these talks , we risk jeopardizing the whole process . #% Our financial support should encompass the whole sector . #% Look at Mr Adam 's amendments and look at the latest British Government briefing - they have learnt nothing ! #% It is a strong assertion of the Commission 's orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies , centre stage inside the Convention . #% We , as governments across the EU , must put in place the appropriate resources to do the job : manpower , money and , dare I say it , sniffer dogs . #% We really should not be voting on those three words . #% Secondly , are we legislating with open eyes about the cost of what is proposed ? #% In network and technological terms those services will still be delivered in a similar fashion as they are today but the technologies applied will be predominantly digital rather than analogue and predominantly fibre-optical and satellite-based rather than electrical , cable and terrestrial broadcast based . #% This motion for a resolution is an expression of worry about a suppression of pluralism and dissent , and that is our business . #% We will not tolerate being robbed of our nationality and our identity . #% These are hardly the hallmarks of a Presidency and Prime Minister leading the agenda and shaping our future . #% We accept that . #% Mr President , while welcoming the debate yesterday on BSE and the subsequent resolution , this House should not forget the human price of past negligence . #% First among them is that science is a global discipline and advances we can share go towards increasing the sum total of human endeavour . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the EU is founded on the principle that all its citizens enjoy equal rights and freedoms . #% In fact she said a mere affiliation with a US exchange does not subject a non-US exchange to US law . #% So the many amendments in my report are an attempt to amend the original proposal and for us to comment on the new compromise text which we happened to obtain , even though it was never given to us officially . #% This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am glad that we are debating these reports within the Commissioner 's term , even if it is only just . #% The other 90 % are on personal leave because of family or educational obligations or they are undertaking external courses . #% It is not competitive selling at a loss to weaken rival products , nor is it driving down the quality of those products . #% I hear the Council 's answer that it does not like the idea of an interinstitutional agreement but instead would be willing to look at a horizontal proposal . #% Their profits have gone down because fuel prices have gone up . #% We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment . #% We have clout and we need to punch our weight in Johannesburg , but I acknowledge that it will be difficult . #% How typical of this mad European Union . #% Mr President , despite numerous condemnations of flagrant infringements of human rights in Iran by many organizations as well as the European Parliament and efforts made by representatives of the Iranian Government to persuade us that the situation has improved , regrettably this is not the case , as numerous events have demonstrated . #% First , I would like to stress our view of the importance of further exploitation of offshore wind energy in the Baltic and the demonstration of different types of wave energy concepts . #% This situation was dramatically worsened on 6 May last year when a Libyan court sentenced the Bulgarian nurses to death by firing squad . #% I conclude , Mr President , by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur , to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions . #% I look forward to further debate on these questions , being Parliament 's rapporteur on the Rapid Reaction Facility that we will be dealing with later in the year . #% I trust that both of those countries will say no to political union and consequently no to economic union as well . #% 
We should point to progress made so far in liberalising the electricity and the gas markets , in particular opening up electricity to more than 60 % of the market so far , while also remembering that we need to keep up the pressure for more progress . #% We want a confirmation from you that you and the Commission , as Mr Van den Broek suggested , will consider our views , because that is the way to secure public support , which you rightly referred to , through a parliamentary channel , for what we are trying to do on enlargement . #% Each of those has a different interface . #% If we do not do something about the catching of black fish , the catching of juveniles , the discard rate , we will not have a fishing industry . #% The Nicaraguan government spent US$ 17 on health and US$ 16 on education per head of population , but about one-and-a-half times the combined total , US$ 47.40 per head , was spent on debt servicing last year . #% The main point concerns Eurostat and OLAF . #% The conclusion the Group came to was that we should not prejudge the outcome of this process . #% I am pleased to see a reference to the use of external ratings removed - it was initially proposed by the rapporteur . #% Everything else in the European Union has changed and it is time that the career structure and the recognition of commitment and capability caught up with those other changes . #% Can we therefore take it that he agrees that the Council 's website is the worst of all public websites ? #% We look forward to what the Commissioner has to say , and I have to underline that it is very important that she should satisfy the Environment Committee and the Parliament , not least because if she is asking us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation , it will have to come through this Parliament by codecision . #% All countries must have a comprehensive energy strategy which is fully in line with nuclear safety account agreements before they can join the European Union . #% That was a lot of money . #% We can be proud of our results . #% We believe it is one of the more successful aspects of EU policy , provided it is carried out according to rigorous criteria and that lessons are learned from other recent accessions . #% Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties . #% Clear and swift decisions are the best way of reassuring victims of the outcome of their claim . #% Madam President , as a veteran observer of these four-year long negotiations I suppose I should not have been surprised by the attitude , particularly of France and Spain , at Monday 's meeting of the General Affairs Council . #% Let us put to one side the conceptual arguments of the past . #% However , behind the headlines there is another agenda already in operation , and that is where the European Union should be involved . #% Mr President , the EU 's strategic partnership with democratic India is of vital importance for both the EU and India . #% On the Commission budget , there are four relevant points . #% There has been a lack of direction and decision quite frequently . #% As we read the regulation , it says that the maximum 1 % level may apply to ingredients of a product , not necessarily simply to the product as a whole . #% It is not the big hand of Europe extending control to local planning matters . #% These emerging democracies deserve better . #% On the other hand , as a participant in the conciliation process , I was pleased at the very real response of the Council to Parliament ' s amendments and take note for future reference about how we can achieve the various amendments and positions we wish . #% Will the sessions of the forum be held openly and in public ? #% It is very significant that in its opinion the Committee of the Regions specifically refers to the restricted scope of local and regional authorities for action when it comes to green procurement and notes that legal action has already been taken against a number of towns and cities which have tried to implement a green procurement policy . #% Mr President , as you know , I am the co-rapporteur with Mrs Buitenweg on this important directive on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% You fought for national self-determination . #% As many as 100 000 people are suffering chronic and debilitating illnesses , with 10 to 15 people a month continuing to die . #% The debate today represents real progress , a real attempt to take the environment into account . #% The next three years will determine whether we can meet the needs of the consumers in an enlarged Europe . #% Yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up . #% This is an impossible situation . #% We know that this would impact on the population at large and in any case we are only too aware how such measures can be evaded . #% All the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Convention of 1951 are well aware of the criteria for determining whether someone should be granted the extremely valuable and significant status of a refugee and I hope that nothing we ever do here would affect the right to make an application within those criteria . #% All things considered , we must respect the results . #% It is not difficult to see that the United States , with 39 % of the total 1990 emissions , would pay the lion ' s share . #% After considerable thought , we can not support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of leaving some of the coral unprotected . #% I would like to know how the White Paper will ensure coherent safety standards , proper labelling and precautionary advice . #% The initial evaluation period will now take place after three years -- originally it was proposed after four years -- and thereafter at intervening four-year timescales . #% Commissioner Lamy talks about certain agricultural products , but it has been precisely the protectionism of the common agricultural policy that has most offended developing countries and which has held back development for many of those countries in terms of agricultural production . #% I , as a lawyer , also have to question why the law should apply to some and not to others . #% I also know that Luxembourg is a splendid state but that when the majority of officials working on public health are physically distant from Brussels that is a tangible problem . #% It is a contempt of Parliament . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for coming to speak to such a packed house about the most important subject facing the planet ! #% Consumers want a very good quality product . #% The financial support into the whole of the Great Lakes region over recent years has been very considerable . #% Without these kinds of new technologies , the future for young men like that is extremely bleak . #% If we are really going to do something to upgrade employment or our social environment , we need to take account of the physical environment . #% There are signs that the end of the Cold War and the new geopolitical realities of the region have forced the adoption of a more reasonable and even pragmatic foreign policy by Damascus . #% Mr President , I want to highlight the areas of the work programme which affect directly the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism . #% The Bush administration has never hidden its determination to remove Saddam Hussein by force if necessary . #% We have carried out a simulation which shows that if we can maintain macro-economic growth pattern of at least 3 % per annum over the next few years , together with the structural reforms and the policy employment guidelines we are suggesting here , we will achieve at least a 65 % employment rate which corresponds to somewhere between 7 % and 8 % of an unemployment rate after five years of operation . #% There are two main obstacles to a card for older people . #% The one , also useful , improvement is that this new directive will simplify the process , hopefully , for European citizens wanting to open a bank account in another EU country , as that bank will not have to carry out further identity checks . #% British Conservatives believe in a very different vision of the EU to the one represented by the Lisbon Treaty , and we are rightly forming a new political group in the European Parliament to champion our vision . #% Nevertheless , the UNCHR is the only international vehicle we have for promoting human rights globally , so we must stick with it . #% I was glad to support their European MS Awareness Day in the European Parliament in Brussels in June of last year . #% Can we make the millennium the year when our systems work . #% We were told to table questions to her . #% Mr President , if you had given me the floor first , as rapporteur , I would have been able to cover the point raised by Mrs McCarthy . #% As always , the amendments in front of us always exceed the amount of money that is available . #% It is not going to be easy but there are some that could be taken now . #% 
In practice , many EU citizens benefit from that particular offer , not least , of course , our friends , the French , across the water , who regularly take up those good deals and many last-minute bargains . #% on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , my thanks go to Mrs Jöns for bringing this issue back before the House . #% There is , however , one thing to which I would like to draw attention : paragraph 26 , which calls for an end to ` what is unfair competitive taxation in the European Union ' . #% Are you confident that commerce will not grind to a halt on 1 January 2000 ? #% I can assure you that any commercial chain in Britain that caused miscarriages and disability would soon find itself in the law courts . #% I thank the Commissioner for the support she gave us in the delegation that attended the summit in New York . #% Can we please try to ensure that both Commission and Council take seriously their various involvements at all levels with the Arctic Council and support open dialogue and action on this important global issue . #% At the moment the British Government , for example , is prepared to send asylum seekers back to Iraq , Congo , Zimbabwe and Afghanistan . #% I welcome tonight , Mr Danielsson ' s statement that European support will be independent . #% The other aspect is that it is also clear from the work we and others have done that not enough professions are actually thinking in terms of moving into a European qualifications framework . #% It is important that we should be required to consider the safety of services and to examine proposals to this end in reasonably quick time . #% We particularly welcome the statement in Paragraph 2 that ` weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation puts at risk the security of our states , our peoples and our interests around the world ' . #% We will also allow groups that disagree with it to table an alternative motion for a resolution , but we will not start voting for hours on hours , paragraph by paragraph , to redraft a committee report of that sort . #% Mr President , congratulations to my colleague on her report . #% For example , a full-length movie will be delivered in seconds rather than hours , as it is at the moment . #% Bearing in mind the French position on the precautionary principle , can a decision be taken rather sooner than a fortnight on where we will be meeting next month ? #% It is the combination of those factors which could lead to a pandemic flu , because it mutates from human to human . #% Thirdly , referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data , I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment , not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13 , and I hope honourable Members will reject them . #% When the original Commission proposal on this subject was published , it said : `` The difficulties of implementing the provisions on the ground should not be underestimated in the case of SMEs '' . #% That ban was largely brought about at the request of the European Union , eager to clean up a previously chaotic and sometimes corrupt system . #% in writing . - I attach enormous importance to the transatlantic relationship and have consistently argued for revitalising and strengthening NATO . #% The question I want clarified is : where does sustainable development fit into this ? #% We have got nothing against the peoples of eastern Europe wanting to get on , but we simply can not have an open-door immigration policy . #% The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate . #% What will it do for me ? #% On the agenda for Wednesday , it seems to me rather sad that , in spite of the special nature of this international situation , reflected by our solemn sitting the day after the events in America on 11 September and the succeeding week , the Council has made a number of proposals for legislation following the terrorist acts which many of us consider as tantamount to an act of war . #% This is the third time I have had the responsibility of being draftsman on the budget for the Committee on Culture and I would particularly like to thank Mr Bourlanges , the budget rapporteur , for his help and cooperation . #% For producers there is now some degree of recompense and this can be negotiated over time . #% However this does not lessen the commitment of our Government to the principles of the report and the underlying values inherent therein . #% That is why the PSE Group has tabled two amendments . #% The first item in internal policy refers to information policy . #% That is something we must absolutely build on with other partners . #% This information needs to be checked , but it is what I was told this morning . #% You made out the case persuasively , as it says in our report , that in many cases the current Staff Regulations are deficient in that respect . #% There are many things which still trouble us . #% Does this financial perspective address Turkey in any way ? #% Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ` scoreboard ' . #% This regulation goes way beyond the directives that it replaces . #% The Commission therefore confirms that the proposal adopted on 29 September 2003 to terminate grants with effect from 2004 complied fully with the Financial Regulation and its implementing provisions . #% It is easy to spend a large budget , but difficult to spend a small budget . #% I take your point about the timing of this debate . #% Article 7 of the agreement deals with regional cooperation , and I would firstly like to touch on two points which relate to Bangladesh 's regional situation and her relationship with neighbouring countries . #% The US position is always a very negative one , as it was when I was at the UN Children 's Conference . #% Our leaders are letting us down . #% If those who want to enter this market can not get a licence on clear and fair terms and within a reasonable timescale , that will be a major obstacle to achieving the goal . #% We had three objections to such a system . #% He has recognised that high economic growth is necessary to achieve low unemployment , to pay pensions and to achieve what is here called ` social cohesion ' or ` social protection ' . #% We meet with them at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Vienna this coming week and I hope that we can all pull together to ensure that we close ranks to support the people of East Timor , so that they can renew that progress towards peace , stability and prosperity . #% Finally , I should like to tell our German colleagues that a number of amendments - I call them the Bodensee amendments because they are the result of lobbying from the Lake Constance authorities - have been tabled . #% Your representative owes you not his industry only , but his judgement and he betrays , instead of serving you , if he sacrifices it to your opinion . #% I am pleased that Mr Lamy says that we are going to have some real action on rules of origin . #% Of course we hope that Liu Xiaobo will be present , but it is unlikely . #% As one Thai official put it , ' I am more worried about today 's mark than tomorrow 's Euro . ' #% Since national posts of ombudsman originated in Scandinavia , we are particularly fortunate in having not just an experienced postholder in Mr Söderman but an ombudsman who brings all the accumulated experience of Finland to the exercise of such a role . #% Let me explain where we must disagree . #% However , what is so impressive is that this report does not come from an MEP from one of the old Member States , lecturing the newcomers on what they should do to catch up ; this rapporteur comes from one of the new Member States . #% We will continue to fight on EDF , trade and other concerns and priorities that we share with our fellow Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians . #% Mr President , I wish to place on record my thanks and those of Parliament first and foremost to Roy Perry , my predecessor , who did so much to enhance the role of the Committee on Petitions , of which the Ombudsman 's role is such an important feature . #% We need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade . #% When did the system change from catch -- the -- eye to putting down names ? #% Such a centralisation of power in Brussels is not the solution and would not be acceptable . #% I would like to refer to the point about how long the fingerprints will be kept . #% So , they rely on things like the lottery . #% The forecasts when I was health minister fighting these issues were not the same as the forecasts now . #% I very much welcome the promotion of poverty eradication as one of the core aims of the new partnership agreement , but we must ensure that this is also reflected in the Commission 's programming through its country strategy papers . #% The Environment Committee insists that we have every right , given the proximity of very many European airports to centres of population , to try to get lower noise levels from planes landing in Europe , no matter where they come from and who operates them . #% 
There has been a disastrous land reform programme -- which no reference to the evils of colonialism can possibly justify -- that has dismantled commercial agriculture without replacing it with any other way of producing food efficiently and effectively . #% I hope that all our warnings and forebodings are not borne out but I should like to be assured of that and that , as a result , there has not been a growth in the fraud committed in the transit system . #% On the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy we all get used to industry representatives coming up to us and saying ` do n't do that , the time-scale is too short , the technology is not available ' . #% Therefore , we should not deny Member States the right to exclude people where there is a proven threat to national security . #% Nestlé ` Cheerios ' is a breakfast cereal which has 21 % sugar and a great deal of salt . #% These concerns are all reflected in the amendments to be considered tomorrow . #% Finally , on the subject of Galileo : this new budget line will do a great deal to give greater transparency and accountability . #% We often hear mention of the . #% So we must make clear that all sides must abide by the cease-fire . #% As the elderly population increases , we need to work out ways of coping with it and to find a strategy across the European Union which really works . #% Today , Parliament , in its resolution , calls for action . #% I have spent a lot of time trying to get it organised . #% Mrs Stenzel makes several valuable points , among which is the need for agreements with other donors on ` sharing ' out who is responsible for what sector to avoid overlaps . #% Today 's political elite seems to have no qualms about such deception . #% Now despite my antipathy to the Bush Administration 's foreign policy it seems to me that it is a perfectly reasonable position for Bush to take on the basis of US self-interest . #% Two small corrections : firstly , Mr Gawronski said the North Koreans refused our invitation . #% in writing . - On behalf of the British Labour Members I wish to explain the reasons why we voted as we did on this report . #% As others have said , many of us here have found that the Commission 's behaviour during the whole debate about the directive has been highly problematic . #% Instead of engaging in this sort of interference , we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards . #% The amount in this year 's budget was EUR 30 million ; the amount in the PDB was EUR 40 million and the amount entered in the Council 's first reading is EUR 47.5 million . #% May I offer you some advice ? #% Once again , we are striving for peace , democracy and security , this time across the central and eastern regions of our continent . #% I believe we should be reconnecting with our constituents , we should relocate that purpose of our European venture and we should communicate it to the public . #% The environment has therefore to be factored in and I would like to know how that is going to be done . #% Well , I wonder , because the last comprehensive Eurobarometer poll carried out in autumn 2005 showed that only 38 % of your fellow countrymen think membership of the European Union has been a good thing . #% GM crops have the potential to bring major benefits , but they also pose threats to the environment . #% That is the sort of thing we need to avoid . #% Since 1992 , the Euro-Flower logo has become a hallmark of environmentally-friendly products , ranging from washing machines to writing paper . #% France and Russia will be judged harshly for using their UN veto for cynical , commercial interests in a second resolution , sending all the wrong signals to Baghdad . #% In many ways , these show that they are living in a world of their own , detached from reality outside . #% This is the message some people in this chamber are giving out and we must kill that off . #% Four amendments have been voted which are in addition to what the committee voted . #% Clearly we can not deal in more detail with the specific case that I cite but our contribution to this debate today should signal our determination to ensure that the rights of vulnerable people in these circumstances are protected . #% Production of wholesome food , protection of the environment and good animal welfare standards must also be key elements of CAP reform . #% It is not only a question of living better , we have to be fitter so that older people can continue by their work to contribute to the wealth of society . #% He has been a great success as a Commissioner . #% It , too , will hold a presidential election and its people will undoubtedly miss the visionary leadership of Álvaro Uribe . #% Would the German presidency explain the details of the German compromise , which we believe is currently under discussion in Council working groups ? #% Why , then , is Hizbollah not banned by the EU until it renounces the use of suicide bombers against innocent civilians and recognises the State of Israel 's right to exist ? #% He would not do anything now to jeopardise that . #% I did so , for instance , when a constituent of mine - Mr David Wilson - who is now facing an appeal in the Greek courts , was arrested and sentenced within 24 hours of his arrest to 12 years in jail , after some stowaway asylum-seekers were found hidden at the back of his lorry without his knowledge . #% He is the modern-day Zeus , and he intends to rule us from Mount Berlaymont - and woe betide anybody that questions his authority or questions his dignity , as they will face severe punishment ! #% However , we do have some reservations about some of the details in this measure . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I am happy at this crucial time in the work of the European Union that Spain takes on the Presidency of the Council . #% I hope that in Conclusion 9 , where we refer to the Commission 's decision to review its own legislative proposals against the criteria of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Commission will be more rigorous in this than some Member States . #% Now we are finally changing the situation on defence rights , and I applaud Vice-President Reding for her commitment to this programme under the road map . #% It is nevertheless very good that he is here . #% I hope that the appointments last week can draw a line under these years of introspection . #% I am delighted to have that agreement ; I hope that augurs well for our relationship in the coming mandate . #% As we have often noted before , motor vehicle accidents unfortunately touch the lives of far too many of our citizens as mobility across Europe grows . #% The centre does not resemble the American Central Direction Center , but is rather a network of networks . #% If REACH passes , even as it stands , with the compromise , any small enterprise with a new idea or a product that might really make this world a better place is likely to find the price of entry into the marketplace impossibly high . #% There have been significant changes in the proposals for sanctions , financing , transparency and import controls . #% We believe that we will not see price reductions in the EU unless location clauses go and dealers are free to set up in different EU Member States . #% We must ensure proper protection for sensitive nursery and spawning grounds such as the Irish Box . #% So , the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all . #% This is a healthy and sensible approach . #% Does the Commissioner think it might be appropriate , even this side of ratifying the Constitution , for the Council to adopt a joint resolution not merely condemning doping in sport , but stating what measures the individual governments that have a strong interest in winning the bid for the Olympic Games propose to take ? #% I do not know , Madam President , whether you are one of the many who now use the tablet form in washing machines , but there has been a movement towards tablets containing phosphate , which can improve the efficiency of use . #% My final point concerns the trans-European networks . #% We aid the corrupt Fatah for years , yet within days we doubt the stated humanitarian intentions of the participants of the coming new Palestinian Authority . #% We , in my delegation and in this group , shall be voting for the 21st century ' s solutions to 21st problems and supporting the committee ' s report . #% How far is this compatible with Commissioner Marin 's own statement to the Development Committee on 29 October last year that Mercosur countries have been struck off the development aid list to concentrate on poorer countries like Bolivia and Peru ? #% It means that the European Parliament will be there at the Convention with a set of proposals on the table . #% Economic growth stands at over 5 % while unemployment is around 2 % . #% That remains an issue on which I am sure the Commission will be creative and inventive when it comes to next year 's budget - to make sure that money can be found , because it is certainly expected . #% 
There are also reports of torture . #% This is nevertheless a start . #% In the first instance it was the great debate on how to fund Kosovo . #% We had a laugh about that . #% In view of renewed military repression in the Kurdish south-east - with the probable aim of provoking the PKK - and recent arrests and disappearances of activists in HADEP ( a legal political party ) it seems Turkey is going backwards rather than forwards in respect of the Copenhagen criteria . #% The directive does just that and it will , therefore , command the full support of the Socialist Group . #% We showed that we were listening and that we would take action over their concerns . #% In fact , 90 % of all accidents on ladders come about because of the misuse of ladders . #% If that is true in the Europe of today , imagine the situation once the Euro has entered the currency markets . #% Some have suggested - I think my Green friends and other critics of the WTO - that somehow these two things are incompatible with each other and that developing new rules on the WTO is anathema to the interests of the developing countries . #% Without commitments to improve multilateral surveillance within the IMF and further involvement of economies other than the current members , little effective success can be foreseen . #% I regret that the European Council did not respond decisively to these votes by declaring the Constitution dead . #% One of the problems that I had with the proposal initially , was that it seemed to want to codify or create a tariff of protection . #% If it can take decisions , they will be slow , cumbersome and on the basis of the lowest common denominator . #% Not only does this contradict the EU 's aims to have more transparency and openness , but it also creates a situation whereby there is unfair tax competition . #% Amendment No 25 which Mrs Read has just mentioned attempts - and Mr van Velzen and others have raised this point - to provide , set against a reasonable fee , for the regulator to establish that there is genuine number portability , and that if there is not , once a user has changed the supplier a telephone call to the old number can be re-routed to the user at a reasonable price . #% My constituents , who are all consumers , and the rest of the British people have rejected the Conservative Government 's plans to privatize the post office . #% A limitation of those rights by a sole decision of the European Council must be regarded as a serious attempt to limit the democratic foundations and the democratic functioning of the European Union . #% I am optimistic that this cooperation will be forthcoming . #% Moreover , the absence of a strict liability compensation convention for non-toxic substances leaves local government picking up the cost of the clean-up . #% We accept the gravity of the security situation in Iraq but believe it unhelpful to use the wording ' a majority of the Iraqi population ' in Amendment 1 . #% More radical reform will depend on whether the Convention approaches an amendment of the 1965 Protocol , the formulation of a Members ' Statute and , finally , the matter of improving Parliament 's access to the court on the question of sanctions . #% That has always seemed to be the way we have done the budget in the past , and Barbara 's analogy with playing a piano is not too far out , because this year is different . #% My own country , Wales , has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice . #% Why are we effectively ignoring the democratic will of the Irish people , who voted to reject the treaty a year ago ? #% We know why really : one of the main reasons is that early years are so important . #% I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission . #% I started to ask myself , Mr Vanhanen , who do you really represent ? #% I would like to know how much of the emergency aid has got through to Central America , what the difficulties have been getting that aid through and what the most pressing needs are now for the people of Central America and what can we do now to help them ? #% When we have a new financial perspective - who knows - it may even be in line with the ABB format of budgeting . #% Amsterdam takes us forward in a number of ways . #% I also welcome the fact that Iceland may be a candidate soon . #% Another important point in the outcome is a strong definition of self-employment . #% I would like to ask you , President-in-Office , what your position will be in Djakarta at the Asean Conference next week when the Council will be represented ? #% Countries like Britain need guarantees that our asylum and immigration policy remains for us to decide and guarantees also that the EU 's approach will remain one of open cooperation and not one of compulsion . #% Before your very eyes see the European Union keep on getting bigger and bigger . #% That is almost beyond our control . #% So of course we export to the third world . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner again and shall leave her a few seconds to sum up . #% This would mean that the directive could be adopted by a qualified majority , and we would then be able to lay the directive to rest . #% Madam President , I welcome this report and want to pay tribute to the rapporteur , Mr Santini , because he has worked very hard on it . #% The proposed ADI is 7 mg/kg of body weight . #% But the Commission 's satisfaction with the post-2001 regime does not take away our right to ask the Commission about the regulatory regime prior to 2001 , nor the Commission 's responsibility to answer us . #% It is early days . #% I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then , if you do not like what they do , you can get rid of them , turf them out and put somebody else in . #% Until clearly defined , planned and effective monitoring of the success or failure of a funded scheme is introduced , it remains all too easy for ill-thought-out and badly managed projects to waste precious resources , to continue to throw good money after bad . #% We need you to go out there and tell the Americans very clearly that noise and gaseous emissions from aircraft are a serious problem in Europe , a more serious problem than in the USA because we are a smaller place and we have a different infrastructure . #% Given the relatively low attendance in this House on Thursdays - I make no comment about why that is - it is quite unacceptable for a major codecision text of this kind to be taken on a Thursday . #% The European Parliament is therefore abdicating any claim to seek to build an effective EU common foreign and security policy . #% That is the opinion of the UK 's Equal Opportunities Commission and I endorse that . #% I do not think that Mrs Gill , as budget rapporteur , reacted in a friendly , humane or reasonable way to that request . #% That applies very much to the process of how we legislate , how we implement legislation and how we enforce legislation . #% The provision of food and feed over the years since we first began to introduce a general food and feed law suggests that we need to have measures that apply right across the Community . #% In Britain we have many hang-ups but , fortunately , not that one . #% I have always taken the view that Parliament must rigorously and ruthlessly defend its constitutional and legal rights . #% You are not telling me what you will do to hold the government in Khartoum to account . #% The junta in Burma is now more hardline and more firmly in control than ever . #% It is a serious attempt to get some common sense into what is a very complicated system . #% Many people have claimed that they have been successful so far ; I have to say that is not my view . #% Do we need a Sixth Environmental Action Programme ? #% Many of these issues could be the subject for next year 's annual report . #% Just in order to concentrate the minds of the Member States , can we ask what the Commission , and indeed the SVC , have concluded as a result of the tests which have been carried out in Switzerland with regard to the number of animals , either by number or proportion , which have entered the human food chain ? #% I was just wondering whether anybody is going to inform the particles of smoke where the smoking zone and the no-smoking zones are . #% China is succeeding in manufacturing , not by a race to the bottom , as the flourishing department stores of Harbin and Chengde prove . #% It is not desirable that management of the sort that we have recently had to endure through negotiations with the Chinese should happen again with any of our competing partners . #% But I look forward to ferrets having the right to roam across Europe , but not just yet . #% 
We need European legislation to outlaw hate crime on grounds not only of race -- which we have still not achieved -- but also of sexual orientation . #% We acknowledge that there are human rights problems in that country to be tackled , but we welcome its partnership in the fight against terrorism . #% Documents were taken away , the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain . #% It seems to me , however , that the Commission 's present proposal is basically a tidying-up operation to amend the Statutes and remedy the situation for any future recruits . #% So , some clarification is needed from the Commission . #% Since I tabled this question , literally in the last couple of weeks , we have had an example in the UK of Germany once again breaking the rules by sending no less than its 13th consignment of meat containing banned spinal cord to the UK . #% But given that the amendment is just to a recital , I do not see how it really strengthens the existing legal possibility . #% It is important to remember that , in terms of the approach to the citizens of the European Union , it is our ability to take action on issues like this which is very important so that people recognise that they are part of a citizens ' Europe and that if they have problems in one country , they can make representation through the legal system properly . #% The challenge now is for us to work together to make this happen . #% To dilute or alter it would be unacceptable and a move born out of political gerrymandering , not a move in favour of maritime safety . #% Mr President , firstly , I should like to congratulate Mr Davies for the work that he has done on this report . #% But no referendum or treaty is required , just a simple vote in the General Affairs Council . #% Madam President , Israel and Palestine are two independent nations but they are not yet two independent states . #% Mr President , like other speakers this afternoon , I welcome the successful conclusion of this budget process . #% In the EU we believe that we have to get a much more similar mindset to America in the way in which we approach SMEs . #% I strongly oppose Amendments 14 and 15 , which are directed exclusively against Turkey on several questions , including the fulfilment of international obligations , and make no equivalent calls for action or engagement on the part of the Greek or Greek Cypriot authorities . #% Teachers are under-qualified , often unqualified , and they struggle without pencils , exercise books or blackboards , often trying to teach children who are simply too hungry to listen or concentrate . #% The author of the oral question has gone as far as calling for the suspension of the more recent 1995 agreement , even though the Commission has controversially agreed with her and imposed tariffs on goods allegedly exported by the settlements in the Occupied Territories . #% We have to look at this directive in terms of the way in which it will be interpreted . #% Mr President , we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important . #% But I say again that while the matter may not come under this remit -- and the Commissioner was quite right to say I was wrong in assuming that hormone beef was part of the trade negotiations -- all this is connected with world trade and it is the kind of issue that will come up . #% We are not ultra-peripheral but being an island makes all the difference . #% Hotmail and Yahoo emails are excluded . #% The ELDR Group would like to highlight three areas where we feel there should be further improvement . #% The danger is that any pre-emptive action in the form of a war of conquest geared to regime change will leave the United States looking like an imperialist power in the Middle East . #% The EU fleet is only one of several implicated in this , but it is implicated all the same . #% Access over the line of control between India-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is also of vital importance . #% Secondly , is the new instrument to be based on an intergovernmental approach , for that is how the EFSF works , or will it in fact be Community-based , which is how we think it should be done ? #% As climate change does bite , we may all be in the situation of representing those who are victims of such natural disasters and may have , therefore , to lay claim to European solidarity . #% That position , in which you do not know enough of what is happening to , and around , you is something this directive has attempted to rectify . #% Mr President , on a point of order : I just wanted to engage in 30 seconds of navel-gazing . #% We do not agree with the wording in paragraph 1 , and we wish to delete the word ` definitive ' from that paragraph because no vote was ever taken in Parliament on the question of the 1996 discharge , which was recommended by the Committee on Budgetary Control to this House . #% Further research is needed and we must be prepared to encourage and support that research as requested in this report . #% It is not part of my job to anticipate what the speakers on behalf of the Social Affairs Committee may say on that matter , but it is very clear , with the high level of unemployment in the European Union , that it is unacceptable that there should be something like 18 million unemployed in our society , with 50 million living in poverty or in near poverty . #% This is not just about having flexibility as a one-way street , but of bringing in the rights of employees . #% His window of opportunity was almost closed , the curtain rapidly falling across his presidency . #% It is my obligation , as Chair of the Transport Committee , to raise this issue with you now by way of this oral question . #% I , and my friends and colleagues from Britain , do not want that kind of discourtesy to be thought of as normal , at least in this Chamber . #% However , whilst we have agreed on the establishment plan , the Committee on Budgets voted for one third of those posts in reserve , albeit by a one-vote majority . #% I personally think not . #% The situation at Sangatte , near Calais , has featured often on television screens in my home country in recent months . #% Madam President , I rise on the same point that Mr De Vries raised . #% Thank you for that very full reply , Mr President-in-Office . #% So I want to see this agenda being driven forward . #% Dounreay has been closed by the nuclear inspectorate . #% The Court can not intervene in any issue : it can only deal with disputes that are referred to it . #% Parliament needs to know that it will be adequate . #% Members of the House have been criticised by the European Environment Bureau for being less than ambitious - in particular for not insisting upon a phasing-out of phosphates across the European Union . #% In particular , I commend the amendments proposed by the Committee on Culture and ask Parliament to think of those organisations such as the youth parliaments and the Youth Orchestra , which do wonderful work for young people but need their funds to be paid in a prompt and efficient manner , something which is not always the case . #% I end with a word of warning : current proposals in the European Convention seem to be aiming to restrict Parliament 's power in the budgetary procedure - we should make sure that this does not happen . #% No doubt this is part of Mr Hague 's reforms . #% What are you doing to ensure the safety of meat coming into this country ? #% A particularly important case here is that of persistent organic pollutants . #% It adds some very sensible , pragmatic proposals as to the sort of things that ought to happen in the Commission 's work programme and the relationship between the work programme and the annual report . #% It greatly strengthens the Commission ' s well-meaning but frankly insubstantial recommendations for inspection procedures which could not guarantee that improvements will actually take place and it provides for a detailed programme of action to make sure that existing laws are properly enforced within a realistic but tight timetable . #% My group will , therefore , be voting for his report but we are still debating paragraph 8 of amendment 2 , where we do have a fear that , in essence , it contradicts the previous paragraphs in the report , and where it opens the door to Parliament becoming involved in the substance of a case rather than in whether or not there should be a waiver of immunity . #% I am sorry that the representative of the Council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning . #% I received a reply which said : ` the research needed in order to provide a detailed response would be out of all proportion to the result desired and exceed the requirements of a response to a written question . ' #% It is very comforting , however , to see that we are able to debate matters of great importance later in the evening . #% I expect we can start work on that in the autumn of this year . #% You have not had a government in your own country since June . #% It is very important that the international community should show that it really means business by bringing Mugabe 's regime in Zimbabwe to task . #% I certainly agree with what he said in the last part of his answer about the need for capacity-building in the least developed countries as well as , perhaps the need for asymmetrical measures , resulting in a certain level of protection for their markets that we do not seek to enjoy in return . #% Now , of course , recent publicity has highlighted the problem with chicken , but this deception is not confined to chicken - adulteration of other meats , particularly ham , is commonplace . #% Politically , fishing is one of the most important issues for our Member States , it arouses tremendous passions , tremendous disputes but we always consign it to Friday . #% Mr President , I do not want a debate but just so that we understand the relationship between what the Foreign Affairs Committee was recommending and what my colleague , the chairman of the Budgets Committee , has just said , can I just for the record confirm that I was impressed by what Mr Henderson said yesterday as President-in-Office of the Council in responding to our amendments from the seat of the Presidency . #% 
But there are only 300 000 people there ; they have renounced violence , unlike some other countries in receipt of EU funds , so the world forgets them . #% I am going to be asking you to be very dynamic and very cooperative . #% Like so much that we see in this Chamber , the objectives of this programme are well-meant . #% deputising for the author . - Mr President , I think we all understand that one of the aims of the GSP system was to integrate the poorer countries into the global trading system . #% They are key characteristics of the Council that we should work to protect at all costs . #% This is simply not acceptable at all . #% Some of them seem to be starting early in looking at issues such as the tripartite summit and Parliament 's involvement there . #% Where the employer finds a risk associated with natural radiation , information will be provided to workers . #% I can give you an assurance that , as Chair of the Transport and Tourism Committee , I look forward to a very successful conclusion to this matter . #% The agreement with Turkey was also endorsed by the Council and opens the way for making the ESDP a reality . #% However , the different measures you have brought forward - on liberalising gas and electricity markets , on promoting renewables , on increasing energy efficiency and on developing trans-European energy networks - make clear to me that there is no need to create a additional chapter or legal base on energy , because you have all these instruments available to you already . #% There is a basic feeling that we should be able to deal with cases on an individual basis as promptly as possible rather than lump everybody together and so postpone a decision . #% This European Parliament , having sought to reject this proposal once and for all , should now vote ` no ' for a second time and never again . #% Turning to the Europe 2020 initiative , we welcome the first tentative steps taken by the Council . #% I would like this to be referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities . #% It is also wrong for Parliament to be excluded from that process . #% What is going on within your systems ? #% Workers have to clean them and I am not sure there is any evidence to show that such areas actually prevent smoke escaping . #% The public wants to be reassured that the long road from seed or stable to market , supermarket , processing plant , oven , fridge and table is as safe as can reasonably be expected . #% I said Managua , I did not say the site of the project . #% We need to note in this respect that it is not a matter of social criteria - putting a question mark over the objective nature of the procurement process - but the very opposite : what matters is to create a level playing field for all those taking part in a procurement procedure . #% Now more urgently , I say to you today , and most of all to the President of the Commission , who has the executive power : you shall not crucify the taxpayers of the UK and the rest of Europe on the cross of the single currency . #% I welcome the proposal establishing the microfinance facility as I believe it will help offer a new start for some of Europe 's most disadvantaged groups by increasing the supply and accessibility of microloans and , in turn , helping people start up their own businesses . #% Despite the difficulties of obtaining reliable and verifiable information , our delegation in Jakarta is closely monitoring developments in the province in coordination with Member State missions to Indonesia . #% I ask you whether it is possible for you to give your reply to Sir Robert Atkins before the vote . #% Thirdly , I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky . #% Sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster . #% The human rights record within Russia is of the utmost concern to many citizens across the EU . #% The Commission , too , must take some blame . #% This is not really a parliament in any sense that the British would understand or recognise . #% It could also be related to co-financing , where the monies are not available in the Member States , in which case we need to take some care about the next steps for agricultural policy , because we could find ourselves in some difficulty if we rely on Member States to implement programmes . #% I hope we can have some clarification . #% This is a gross waste of taxpayers ' money ! #% In my view the Commission 's proposal is broadly acceptable and the most workable approach . #% Its responsibility does not extend to the scrutiny or review of Council activities . #% No , it is just rush-hour in my region . #% Other PVCs are treated with stabilisers to prevent them being broken down by heat and light . #% We welcome the pressure they put on Burma and note that the current military regime has refused to allow them to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi . #% Mr President , I would like to say that I agree with the report . #% When our friends and colleagues come next year to London , now miraculously free from its all-enveloping 19th century smog , let us hope that only the mist and mizzle of the 21st century stand between us and ASEAN in the development of our fraternal futures together . #% Equally , we want a further widening and strengthening of sanctions against the regime , with the introduction of additional measures to make international action against the regime more effective , in particular the stringent enforcement of the visa ban . #% Prior to that , I and colleagues had the onerous task of determining whether a case should be referred back to the High Court because of an alleged miscarriage of justice . #% The common concern of both the Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and the Teverson reports is the need for effective monitoring and enforcement of international and Community fishing agreements . #% Croatia , along with Iceland - if approved as a candidate - is undoubtedly the country most ready to join the European Union , and its accession will help stabilise the Western Balkans . #% This is a very topical report in the sense that this issue - biotechnology - has attracted a great deal of public interest and concern over the last few years . #% I wonder whether the US has a mandate . #% I welcome this resolution but we must drive it forward . #% Bulgaria seems to have made less progress , with a spate of horrendous mafia-style contract killings , which are of major concern to all of us . #% Another important point that needs to be addressed - and I hope the President-in-Office can refer to this today - is the whole question of political coordination . #% As you know , the UK has a number of semi-wild herds of ponies in the New Forest and Dartmoor . #% They will all be judged on their own merits . #% However , at the risk of being accused of putting a dampener on our celebrations , I must point out that we are not there yet . #% We must help them to do this through increasing assistance and improving its effectiveness . #% That is a welcome and necessary step , but it needs to be done in the right way . #% Never in the field of vegetable and fruit cultivation has so much been said to so little purpose . #% Subsidiarity must be seen to apply : it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so . #% But if we have the information at our disposal we should look more carefully at the achievement of goals with this money , rather than purely the fact that the money has been spent . #% I should like you to pass on to Commissioner Monti , who I believe should be here , the message that we need to encourage industries to work together on reconfiguring their processes in order to make better quality products more competitively and at a better price . #% Trade barriers hurt poor people in general and women in particular , since it is these groups of poor people who tend to produce the goods that are most affected : agricultural goods and labour-intensive manufactured goods . #% The question I would like to ask going on from that is how broad do you think the questions will be that they will be able to ask ? #% Secondly , I believe nuclear weapons pose such a threat to all of us that it is legitimate and indeed essential to use all peaceful avenues open to us to try to rid our countries of them . #% In the context of what we know about the countries that do collect batteries , that seems reasonable . #% He made a totally biased , one-sided address and there was no catch-the-eye opportunity to reply to what he said . #% We need a balanced approach to this problem which afflicts 0.04 % of tourists . #% I feel he has made a very good point . #% The 1997 EMI report fails to reflect the interesting and enlightening exchanges Parliament had with the other ECB candidates on 7 and 8 May about the choice of direct inflation targets , with margin or monetary supply objectives - or a combination of both - as a preferred measure of price stability . #% 
Closing EU borders to agricultural products from third countries is not the answer . #% Has this refusal to release funds been universal ; has it been entirely by agreement of the Council or has it been the case that some Member States have been instrumental in securing the blocking of expenditure ? #% It is as well to bear that in mind as a background to what he has just said . #% But the Community has committed itself to adopting harmonised safety requirements for the operation of aircraft . #% This proposal is well balanced and calls for a wide range of instruments to be developed to deter people from breaching the rules , including individual liability , transparency and accountability of firms , the right of defence and due process . #% But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters , and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity , rather than nicely formulated institutions . #% In particular , we will be looking for evidence that each new proposal has been properly tested against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and we will be looking for sector-specific debates in the European Parliament 's own specialised committees . #% Whether they are involved in illegal drugs , the supplying of illegal weapons or international terrorism , these are international issues which cross European borders . #% Some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration . #% It has been tabled with reference to both Langen reports and recitals . #% I , for one , have taken this up in the past with the Honduran authorities . #% I have amended the proposal to make the disease control measures tougher , notably where avian influenza is only suspected , and with respect to the movement of table and hatching eggs . #% Almost all of the world 's least developed countries are members of the ACP group . #% It is also important to recognise that ` Women on Waves ' is only called into countries when women 's organisations in those countries concerned actually request it . #% I have been talking , along with other colleagues today , to members of the political opposition in many countries in Africa . #% . My British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the Fava report because we believe that the report is heavy on allegations and short on new evidence or proof . #% We have to be careful that , in dealing with these new technologies , we do not design a system like that of the man with the red flag who tries to block the advances of the car . #% It is time to apply further restrictive measures - including a ban on new investment . #% However , while recognising the need to avoid duplication of effort , is the Council maintaining close and continuous contact with both the Moroccan authorities and the Polisario in order to press for the resolution of any difficulties which arise ? #% But under the cover of the darkness of the Lebanon war , the IDF returned to its old practices in Gaza as if there had been no disengagement . ' #% We have to face up to the reality that we will have a different agricultural policy for 25 Member States than we have for the existing 15 . #% He said that territorial cohesion becomes an essential objective of the EU in the Constitution . #% The call to allocate money to the information society demonstrates a real commitment to substantiate the Union 's stated ambitions laid out at the Lisbon so-called dot-com summit , to make the EU one of the most competitive and dynamic economies in the world . #% I am against it because there are better uses for this level of public expense . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Busk on his excellent report . #% I ask this Parliament to be measured and considered in the way it deals with this important issue . #% It may be that the Commissioner secretly wishes Parliament to pursue its original agenda . #% That is not defensible . #% Meanwhile , the Council , Commission and Member States must redouble their efforts to help bring a stable and just peace to Sri Lanka and restore security and prosperity , and that includes bearing down hard on the agents of terrorism . #% For the first time ever we are committing ourselves as a European Union to a strategic environmental assessment . #% We must also work in partnership with the applicant countries . #% Why are 17 EU Prime Ministers -- and you are now telling me it is actually 20 Prime Ministers , including Tony Blair -- saying ` no ' to the police by refusing to sign up to this convention ? #% As an example , think ` climate ' : keeping a house warm near the Arctic Circle needs much more money than in Mediterranean countries . #% Paradoxically , it now seems that national sovereignty is undermining the EU 's global ambitions , as we saw recently over what happened in Libya . #% They will no doubt be long and difficult , but if agreement can be reached and if Turkey meets all the necessary conditions regarding the functioning of democracy and respect for human rights including the rights of minorities then there is no reason of principle why it should not be entitled to join the European Union . #% The Minister is right . #% There is another report out today which was an annual report from the Commission , referred to in today 's Financial Times under the wonderful heading `` Brussels demands labour reform '' . #% This too is an area which need to be addressed . #% However , it is its job to ensure there is proper competition in the EU market . #% We heard from small - and medium-sized enterprises without departments devoted to human resources as to how complex it can be to find the individual that you want and deal with the paperwork , and how long it can take before that person actually starts work . #% For obvious reasons we do not yet know the exact number of recognised partnerships amongst the staff of the institutions or the numbers involved . #% By proposing a training regime for professional drivers we will be enhancing the status of those drivers . #% But these things happen . #% I believe that his subsequent briefings on this matter have deepened this dispute in the most serious way . #% To my mind too many of the young people in Bangladesh leave to be educated abroad in Europe and the United States , which I commend , which is good ; but then many of them do not go back to Bangladesh to take back their education , their experience and their great strength . #% Just to give three examples for the 1999 financial year we are looking at : the European Youth Orchestra , the European Youth Parliament , the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation only received their grant from the European Commission in the last days of the year . #% I thank the Commissioner for all his work . #% So this is that rare incisive moment in a frantic world : it is a market measure which will help save lives . #% However , there are two things I still want to talk about . #% The report recognises the importance of Member States sharing best practice and exchanging information , but also emphasises that pensions remain a Member State competence . #% While stressing that we must have a WTO Millennium Round that is as comprehensive as possible so that everybody can get something out of it , there are three issues I would like to draw attention to . #% However , Vietnam , 30 years ago and even 10 years ago , was a very poor country , probably poorer than many sub-Saharan African countries . #% May I begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that he has put into this . #% On Turkish accession to the Union , Mr Verheugen gave us a very detailed analysis of the political and economic reforms that have been made . #% On the contrary , there is a risk of a very open-ended approach towards EU business because of the very open-ended nature of the three priorities themselves . #% We believe that the conduct of the trial of the former prime minister will also be a clear sign as to the military 's good intentions to return to , or rather not to return but to introduce good democratic government to Pakistan . #% This resolution does not threaten talks between the EU and Iran regarding future trade and cooperation agreements , though it is clear that this will include a human rights clause . #% So let us encourage the national parliaments to do the job as effectively as the Danes do . #% I do not believe that is fair to European producers ; but it is not fair to Chinese workers either , who are working for pitiful wages -- around USD 12 per week , as mentioned in reports of -- while at the same time social rights are reduced to an absolute minimum . #% How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology - and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union . #% I have several points to make . #% I say this not to slight the Commission or their staff but to say that cooperation is needed in order to achieve what Mr Ruffolo , in such an exemplary manner , has set out . #% Who is going to be represented ? #% ` Operation Drive Out Rubbish ' : that is what Robert Mugabe calls his latest atrocity . #% He is in the unusual position of producing a report on Commission action which has already been taken and it is the way it has been taken that we are to some extent talking about here . #% My Labour colleagues and I have voted for Amendments Nos 13 and 24 to Article 20 and Amendment No 15 to Article 21 of the Marinho report . #% 
Commissioner Liikanen 's services need to make sure that they are sorting out the fine detail . #% We have the sunset clause : after four years the delegated powers will revert to Parliament and the Council , unless we agree to renew them . #% This document clearly sets out the importance of intellectual property in the contemporary world and the damage that theft of that property can do . #% This is an Islamic state , and yet a democracy ; it has Sharia law , and yet a parliament . #% Mr Lambsdorff has allowed me the opportunity of thanking Mr Van Orden for his dedicated and serious work , which has helped Bulgaria immensely to accede to the Union on this date . #% I do appreciate that UKIP have no idea with regard to manners and parliamentary procedure ; this was evident recently in Brussels . #% We have to ensure not only that we implement Kyoto -- which , as we know , will do nothing to combat climate change but will simply slow down the process -- but also that we involve developing nations , raise the targets and find ways of changing public policy in ways that are politically acceptable and involve the United States . #% I would simply ask you to confirm that the action of the House in receiving this report is fully in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and that it is acceptable . #% If anything has become clear from the controversy over unlawful CIA operations in Europe , it is that when it comes to human rights , the EU has failed to keep its own house in order . #% We have heard a lot today and we will rightly hear a lot more about one of the biggest challenges , Aids : two days ago , Kofi Annan was appealing to the world to play a bigger part in this . #% It is so politically difficult because of the fossil fuel industries ' determination to jam up the legislative process both here and in America . #% In finally presenting this report to plenary on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee , there are many people I should and will thank , but there is one whose inspiration I would especially like to mention because I hope it will set the scene for our debate tonight . #% I urge the Romanian Government to consider concluding these adoptions , in particular the 1 100 pipeline cases of orphans and abandoned children for whom caring foreign families had registered adoption petitions prior to the January 2005 ban . #% It is never an easy job to steer something through this House , as I know , and I think that they should be warmly applauded . #% There was a fault in the first instance in that the person was not sent to the proper institution . #% Personally , I would prefer that there should be no deadline , but I think that what the Commission proposes is the maximum practicable limit . #% We should be very thankful that , despite the efforts of the bombers , at least no-one died . #% Mr President , I wanted to speak before the debate actually started , because we had been led to believe in our group meeting that one of the other political groups had tabled an amendment under Rule 146 calling for this debate to be adjourned until the next part-session . #% We thank you . #% That 's too close to Lunnon for my liking . #% This is a welcome change in our working methods and should allow us to plan and prepare our legislative work much better . #% She wants us to have a foolproof method in terms of the measurement of chocolates which has never been thought of before . #% The fact that they are now paramount argues the case for this report . #% There are amendments , including some from the Committee on Budgets , which I would support , suggesting that we take in hand the precise financing of this agency ourselves . #% So the US now has to reconsider and I know it is doing so . #% We want to ensure all this new legislation , worthy though it is , is complied with not just by the ship operators but also by the Member States themselves who , sadly , over the years , have shown a reluctance to adhere to Community law . #% We will be recommending to colleagues in the House tomorrow that they approve all the amendments , but that we should withhold our vote on the final legislative resolution until such time as we are satisfied that the Commissioner has achieved all he is setting out to achieve . #% Certain chapters in the history of Central and Eastern Europe have been forgotten and we have to look at them . #% Would you agree Mr President-in-Office of the Council , based on your experience in the Parliament , that we do need separation of the powers and will you be urging the Danish presidency to put this forward at the Convention ? #% You have already heard that this is indeed a formidable combination and an extremely comprehensive and thorough report from Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , but Mr MacCormick added his own distinctive touches to the report , the flavour of which you have just heard . #% It is a good day for Pakistan , for Kashmir , and for the Indian subcontinent and I am very pleased to have been here today . #% The problem I have is that it still involves the idea of an automatic ban on nickel cadmium batteries after four years ; the Commission is not asked to carry out an impact assessment to see what we should do . #% In particular , we must try to have the education agreement implemented and make progress on civil building measures within Kosovo . #% That is not the way to do an inventory and it is one of the points I know Mr Tomlinson and our group have been commenting on for quite some time . #% There are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure . #% It is our job to set a broad legislative framework in the public interest . #% We know all our lessons from the history of food problems . #% There are micro and macro sides to the problems . #% UKIP wants to see organic farming flourishing , not buried under tonnes of EU manure . #% The vast majority of Britain 's countryside is disease-free and open for business , subject to sensible precautions about staying away from farm land and farm animals . #% The fact that MEPs are spending their time discussing lawnmowers will no doubt confirm the impression which too many of our constituents have about the value of our work . #% We have to tread very carefully here if we are not to tie up even more red tape around the Member States . #% Reference has been made in this House this morning to forthcoming elections in Algeria and Tunisia , where very little money is getting through to the NGOs and activists who are looking for a free media and the development of human rights . #% Many concerns have been expressed that the great wealth of varieties which still exists within the countries of the European Union could be reduced as a result of official Community policy to a few standard strains of seeds throughout Europe . #% Are they in or out ? #% The common fisheries policy is one of the few common policies we have in the European Union and so the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council of Ministers have a very important role in terms of legislation . #% By harnessing Euro-Flower power , we can all contribute to a cleaner , greener world . #% Hampshire is prosperous . #% The result would certainly be greatly inferior . #% I would be very interested in the views of the Commission and Council on that proposal . #% Mr President , I would just like the commissioners to wait to hear the point of order . #% If we are to have a fruitful stabilisation and association process , how come the European Union and associated countries can not work together to stop the US getting these agreements ? #% I appeal to you to write to the Taliban authorities demanding fair treatment for those arrested and their rapid release . #% He was adamant that he would follow the constitution and that free and fair elections would take place . #% The EU is not a Christian club . #% The Commission is trying to impose a straitjacket on something that can not and does not need to be standardised . #% It was optimistic of governments to set this target , but not unrealistic , given that it is within their grasp to achieve it . #% Indeed , I hope that Parliament will take this opportunity to reform our own outdated procedures and practices including the financial provisions for MEPs . #% We will be supporting a number of Mr Katiforis ' amendments because they make a bad proposal rather better . #% Mr President , we all know the significance of this proposal to the many industrial sectors within the economies of the states of the Union which is perhaps one of the reasons why we have taken so long already to reach an agreement about the provisions of the proposal and why we find ourselves at this point in the legislative process . #% Is she really prepared to tell people such as those whom I represent in Merseyside and the North-West of England that they must lose Structural Funds because their governments have failed to comply with the habitats directive ? #% What rights should we give to our regions ? #% We are in a situation where Member States differ , firstly , in their definition of what a veterinary surgeon is and what it means and , secondly , in the dispensing of these drugs . #% I certainly welcome what you say about Article 35 . #% The MODINIS programme aims to create a legal base for the continuation of activities for monitoring the eEurope plan from 2003 to 2005 and for the dissemination of best practices . #% However , I am still concerned about legislation in matters of employment being made in Brussels . #% 
That is , after all , the nature of intelligence and military information work . #% I would like to say , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , that we very much support what the rapporteur has said on unfair commercial practices , that is , that the principle of the vulnerable consumer must be accepted and recognised , that we must take into account disparities between national protection rules , that we must insist on a double legal basis and that the principle of optimum harmonisation should hold good for all three directives . #% It is the particular task of this Parliament to refine and specify the proposal from the Commission , that is , to remind citizens and stakeholders alike exactly what we are intending to do to safeguard all parts of the food chain , at whatever point we happen to be in it , from primary producers through to ultimate consumers . #% Secondly , we want to encourage more workers back into the industry , particularly EU young people . #% I must pay tribute to Commissioner Barrot and to Commission President Barroso for taking action here and I hope to see Commission officials follow their political lead and come up with speedy and workable solutions . #% Could I suggest , Mrs Wallström , that in future , when environment legislation like this is considered , the full implications regarding applicant countries be taken into account and publicised . #% It is currently possible to drive for up to 8 hours and 59 minutes with only a 15-minute break . #% I agree that there is a need to combat smuggling and trafficking through the orderly and managed arrival of refugees . #% We all wish to see a democratic , European Russia with whom we can all share fundamental common values of basic human rights . #% Which net payers , apart from the UK , are prepared to pay more money to solve the budget problem ? #% The sportsmen and women themselves are now getting a fair return for their skills and it is their skills that make the sporting activities worth watching . #% We must never lose sight of the fact that the benefits of enlargement far outweigh the costs . #% I find it disturbing , to say the least , that Romania is one of the countries exempted by the United States of America . #% We have to start paying some respect to the forces of democracy , and we have to recognise that you can not make peace without talking to your enemy . #% Mr President , this Parliament has warned time and time again against the danger of unravelling the Treaty by taking away one bit , then another , then another . #% We are consultees . #% I wholeheartedly support what Mr Needle said in this regard . #% Mr President , I wish to speak in favour of the Mexico partnership agreement and to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and thank Mr Marín for his contribution . #% It has been a challenge , sometimes , because she has been a very determined leader in pushing this forward , but I think that what we have done together will be good for European citizens . #% This article was about birds - thousands of bird species under threat . #% Within this Chamber there have been all sorts of parliamentary tactics to delay and destroy REACH over the years , and here we are with a remarkable measure of agreement all round . #% Finally , Parliament calls on the Commission to draw up a further report , preferably before the end of this year , on the implementation of the recommendation with specific reference to implementation in each Member State . #% Therefore this disease has a twofold cost : firstly , the human cost in terms of its impact on sufferers and their families and , secondly , as a major health burden to society as a whole . #% We need a pause for reflection on the length of our commitment to this financial perspective . #% We simply want the title so that we can get access to the information , to the publications and to the network of other centres . #% Part of that must be the economic reform agenda . #% The process has been considerably more transparent than the conciliation process and these compromise amendments were agreed on 25 April in the LIBE Committee . #% UKIP MEPs have therefore felt obliged to vote against this resolution . #% This commitment was emphasised by the Cologne Council and Feira when it was stated that strategic decisions had to be taken by December 2000 . #% Regarding the open coordination method , we stress that this must not be a substitute for Parliament 's involvement in the whole process of working towards a common asylum policy and indeed a common immigration policy : we are committed to the full communitarisation of these topics . #% Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle . #% Mr President , I should like to make it clear that the Bureau asked the Committee on Budgets to take a certain action , which Mrs Gill , as Budget rapporteur , could have done . #% It is better perhaps to focus public resources on identifiable challenges , such as planning for the enormous change and cost of introducing the single currency , or , even more important , finding a solution to the so-called millennium time-bomb of computers that will not recognize the year 2000 and then crash . #% It is not so bad for him to be invited by the Queen or by President Chirac but please , not here . #% I ask the Commission , which has been a strong advocate of reform , what step it is now going to take to stop this smuggling of CFCs into the European Union ? #% The minimal progress we have made in this area , compared with the headlong progress we have made in the financial , economic and many other spheres of Community activity , is now causing serious problems . #% Since the original Treaties , though , we have seen the emergence of this Parliament , which was first directly elected in 1979 and more recently has acquired co-legislative powers . #% My argument is that if there is n't enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions , ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls . #% Well , a decade on , I would suggest that what it has brought is chaos , discord and misery for millions , and yet the word ` stability ' is still being used this morning . #% Mr President , in 11 months time 11 countries will enter economic and monetary union here in Europe . #% Yet while doing so I would enter a reservation . #% I have seen the letter that Commissioners Schreyer , Kinnock and de Palacio have written , where they state that the conditions for release of the reserve have been met . #% I also call on the airlines to adopt the recommendations of paragraph 13 ( c ) as soon as possible , particularly regarding smoke hoods , water mist systems and externally mounted cameras . #% I welcome that agreement , but it must be clear - which it is - that the new Parliament must be the one to approve the new President and Commission . #% Cases of food poisoning related to beef are rare , and more often than not can be attributed to storage and preparation in the home or catering outlet , rather than to the processors . #% I felt there was a danger of the agency taking a slightly imperialist tone towards the local delegation . #% We want funding mechanisms that fast-track funds so that we can maintain the political commitment and mobilise further resources . #% We should wait for the expert study and then see what action can be taken in January . #% Very often it leads to the European Union exploiting third countries ' waters and means that fishermen in these third countries are driven out of business and the whole thing is being brought into disrepute . #% Afghanistan is a very difficult country to help . #% Mr President , first of all I thank the rapporteur for her splendid work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr Vatanen for his contribution , speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . #% This morning , the Libyan Supreme Court delayed a decision on their case until January 2006 . #% Last year one quarter of the flasks sent by rail from Germany to France had not been properly cleaned and were thoroughly contaminated . #% My own question for later on relates to a similar area . #% Finally , the question of gender language . #% Now we see intense fighting in Somalia , where about a thousand people have died and where Ethiopian troops have been very active , fighting on behalf of the transitional government in Somalia , but of course - as we all have to acknowledge - with covert assistance from the United States . #% I commend them to the House . #% Our committees have been working with the rapporteurs to ensure that we can bring forward sensible amendments . #% If we have joined-up policy-making , however , we will have a long-term , sustainable future for automotive manufacture in Europe . #% Madam President , I too wish to congratulate Mr Spencer on his report . #% I am very concerned that the United States envisages a reduction in aid budgets to fund debt cancellation . #% The only way that you will achieve the participation in this European project that you want is through consent . #% Both pillars have the advantage of being resistant to demographic change , and third-pillar portable schemes , in particular , which are not restricted to single companies , enhance labour mobility and choice for the investors and are much more affordable to small and medium enterprises . #% It is time other Member States took a much firmer line with Greece on this matter . #% I will concentrate on what the Commissioner said . #% Again , this is of practical benefit enabling citizens to exercise their rights in the internal market . #% 
It is not a good system for the Minister to come and answer two questions after three months . #% Mr President , Prime Minister , the United Kingdom 's control order regime brought into force by the forthcoming presidency , flouts the presumption of innocence and can not reasonably be described as sitting squarely with any accepted European notions of fairness and basic human dignity . #% We gave urgency to the activities but we still have not agreed how to pay for them and that is what this report is about . #% For malaria and TB , which are already increasing in developed countries , there are several partnership research projects under way which include a pledge to make the eventual drugs affordable for developing countries . #% I voted to keep tobacco off TV screens and to limit alcohol advertising . #% Now we have a situation - an army coup d'état - partly triggered by a plan by the former government to lease one million acres of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm for intensive farming , when a substantial majority of the population live on less than one euro a day . #% Secondly , we must tackle congestion . #% I represent Portsmouth in the United Kingdom , the home of the Royal Navy . #% But efforts to develop this capacity have been sadly and consistently blocked by France . #% We must make it clear to the KLA that they can gain only if there is a political agreement which will give them a large degree of autonomy . #% Well , now the penny has dropped and they have realised that a British government is unable to put British interests first . #% I now want the political initiative . #% His research has never been confirmed by peer review - indeed it was rejected by the Commission 's own scientific committee , the CSTEE . #% I should like to agree with Mr Crowley 's last couple of comments . #% If he found that he had a Greek grandfather he could claim Greek citizenship and again have no problem . #% I challenge those Members who are sitting opposite today , not to just give a prepared speech or ignore what I am saying now but to tell us why they are opposing certain parts of it and why they want to diminish the rights of a fair appeal , which is Amendments Nos 6 and 8 by Mr Schmitt . #% Those problems have actually got worse , which is why we currently have a directive and a proposal before us this evening . #% The EUR 40 billion a year that the European Union spends on the CAP is an expensive way to distort our farming industry . #% In that sense , of course , no one is questioning the value of the request from the United Nations for a mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo . #% Of course , we might have secured more , but speed is of the essence . #% With nonchalant ease , they have gone through approving the 1996 , the 1997 discharge , and it has been up to us in Parliament to press for change at every turn . #% Of course there is , because we aspire within the European Union to perhaps defy our critics , to prove them wrong , to connect with our citizens and to prove that the European Union project is one that we should be proud of and should celebrate . #% These are the sorts of points I would love to be at the macroeconomic dialogue next week to make , but sadly neither I nor any other Member of this institution will be allowed to be present at that meeting next week . #% However , this motion for a resolution fails to mention the results of investigations carried out by the Belgian authorities . #% In that sense , we must support the rapporteur 's amendments and look very carefully at some of the amendments which I hope we will see in conciliation in order to achieve further progress . #% And , indeed , if the guidelines on environmental inspection which the Commission is so keen to see survive were incorporated in a recommendation , my committee feels that they will simply be ignored . #% I remind my British colleagues particularly , therefore , that if they vote for this measure they are voting for political integration . #% Mr President , the value of sport as a tool to promote national identity and further integration has long been recognised . #% Finally , I would expect that it may take some time for some people to understand and implement the principles set out in this report , but they will . #% The Vade Mecum on State Aid produced by DG Competition is a model of the latter . #% I believe that they should be included for several reasons , but the main one is again that they can undercut the other hauliers , and this will have tremendous health and safety implications . #% We know that scarce resources in the budget will be with us for the foreseeable future . #% This permits the kind of progress we hope to see . #% As a result it will not be possible to implement the expected recruitment policies . #% The way towards peace and the way for Europe to contribute towards peace is to use its influence in the area , particularly on the Palestinians , and to say to them , yes , there should be a Palestinian state , yes , there should be a State of Israel , but both must have security throughout the years to come . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this debate on permitted levels of radioactivity in food is timely , because this April will be the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster . #% The sickness rate in the contaminated areas has grown dramatically . #% In Indonesia itself , the population will demand genuinely free elections and , with so many people under the age of thirty , completely new forces could emerge to participate in a far-reaching transition which we must hope will be peaceful . #% Waiting for the successors of Chirac , Balkenende and Blair to be thrusting federalists is a crazy fantasy . #% It is prohibition which kills users by denying them the information they need about the drugs they put into their bodies . #% Member States must be free to sign bilateral agreements with third countries . #% One year ago I remarked in this House that one of the central features of the EU was that each Member State could bring to the table its best practice to share with all the others . #% We have not seen a very effective policy on Zimbabwe , for instance . #% What do they see ? #% These have tended to grow and grow and , frankly , seem to serve no particular purpose when we know in fact that they are answered in a rather bureaucratic way beforehand . #% Chinese weapons have helped sustain conflicts and human rights violations in Sudan , Nepal , Burma and southern Africa . #% The Committee on Petitions supports the view taken by the rapporteur , Mr Deprez , and thanks him for his diligence in this matter . #% We welcome , as the report says , the comparative evaluation being undertaken by the European Multiple Sclerosis Centre . #% To make it worse , at least one Member State is asking us to find the extra EUR 65 million , which complicates matters when we know what the Council 's position is already . #% Because I do not speak Portuguese I shall study the reply before the next question time and come back to you on it in April . #% As well as being preventative , vaccines are usually one-off treatments , something which is an additional benefit in environments and countries where drug storage and dosage regimes are hard to follow or supply routes are insecure . #% They had the sense , the decency and the foresight and , I suppose , the resources to treat a disabled person as a real person . #% Many of the returnees are women , many of whom are widows or single mothers stigmatized because of that . #% Secondly , the revamping of existing legislation and introduction of new legislation which recognises the specific needs of sectors of the financial services industry , in particular Solvency II and CRD , are vital elements which contribute to the management of risk . #% I would like to think that when a report comes from the Commission the Council will address that issue . #% For me the key argument is one of democratic accountability . #% But , even with all that cover , it can still find its way to the bottom of the pile and the leaflet that comes in the door is not put on display . #% One thinks of melons as somewhere halfway between the two , but the distinction between them is surely that one does not consume the exterior of a pineapple - unless one is very stupid indeed ! - whereas one would usually eat the skin of a peach . #% Surely it would be disastrous if developing countries were expected to do trade-offs in the only real area where they secured such a major victory at Doha . #% We believe we need something more to ensure that passengers are better protected from delays and cancellations . #% In Zambia , treatment of one member of a family for pneumonia will take up the family 's entire monthly budget . #% I well remember the sympathy and solidarity that I received from my colleagues here in the European Parliament at that time last year , and that which we showed to our Spanish colleagues the year before at the time of the Madrid bombings . #% I still hope very much that Greek Cypriots , as well as Turkish Cypriots , will vote ` yes ' on Saturday . #% We want to see greater support given to the ` car of the future ' initiative . #% The Commission is the guardian of treaties that are already unacceptable . #% My group welcomes the outcome of these negotiations . #% 
Mr President , others have established the need for action . #% Which expensive new service will it call ? #% They need only to make a declaration of interest in committee or in Parliament if they speak on the matter . #% For example , every question in the first part of this session was tabled after my own question , which is being dealt with much later . #% There are serious questions that we need to ask about the mechanism , about how simple it is to access and about how effective it is in practical terms . #% But we must also take account of the environment , particularly in this week of the Johannesburg Earth Summit . #% According to your rhetoric , Commissioner , these negotiations were supposed to be heralding a development round which prioritises the concerns of developing countries . #% Our countryside is in the process of being turned into a monstrous Meccano set for the sake of meeting renewable energy targets dreamed up by the European Commission . #% The report in its original form was more like the description of the Merovingian dynasty as despotism tempered by assassination . #% For example , in a debate on the revision of the working time directive last week in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the point was made very forcibly by Liberal Members that we need a full business impact assessment . #% In these circumstances it seems only appropriate that those vessel owners who benefit from third-country agreements should take on a fairer share of the financial burden involved . #% In that case I urge the Commission , the Council and all other EU Heads of State to do all they can to help us restrain their fellow EU Member State . #% That option is available to any government in the European Union . #% The Nice Treaty must in time cease to exist . #% Firstly , it should send out a clear signal of our continuing political commitment to the enlargement process . #% We are looking at where regulation has succeeded and , if I could say to Mr Harbour , not only where regulation has failed but why it has failed , and that is very important . #% We urgently need a clear definition of the concepts of information and consultation in EU law . #% It has been seen as remote and , unless we have proper ownership , quite frankly it will continue to be remote . #% Some of us are in doubt about how far this reform has gone , how the rest of it is going to be achieved and when it will be implemented . #% Your compatriot , Mr Vitorino , did a great job and , on the whole , struck the right balance between freedom and security . #% We can not pretend that these problems do not exist . #% We need to continue together with the Commissioner the task of creating a true single market for consumers . #% The issue with this report is the fact that we have done a huge amount of work already , but we now need to see the pay-off from that work . #% Sometimes , though , discarding is the outcome of conditions we ourselves impose , for example minimum landing sizes , and restrictions on quotas . #% Yesterday , however , I spoke to friends and colleagues in the NGO UNA International Service , which is active in the region . #% I want to conclude with my thanks to the Federation of Small Businesses in the United Kingdom and say two things to the House today about the importance of this directive . #% I have to say , though , I have been disappointed by some of my colleagues : some Members of this House believe that we should actually tell developing countries to close their markets . #% I welcome very much the comments you made to that effect . #% After all , the poor status quo brought about these proposals after initial reports showed the weaknesses . #% I should like to say to Mr Fitzsimons that the Commission is well aware of the issues he has raised . #% We in the ECR also hope that Ratko Mladić will be caught and sent to The Hague , though it is by no means certain that he is on Serbian territory . #% And , indeed , the same is true for blood alcohol . #% I believe we all come here to work on behalf of Europe 's people , not to spend our time in debates about our own pay and status . #% Mr President , I should like to know who is responsible for security staff outside the Chamber . #% It is not clear to me that this will make us more secure and safe from crime . #% There would be no point in those impact assessments if MEPs in the European Parliament or Ministers in the Council of Ministers were then to ignore your assessment and simply revise the legislation without any regard for the impact . #% In this connection , I welcome new proposals by my Socialist Group colleagues for a European Small Claims Court to help people facing ruin due to EU disputes in future . #% After the War , the freedom of the West was guaranteed by the continuing engagement of US forces , through NATO , in the security of Europe . #% . That was a very lengthy response , but with respect it was not really an answer because I appreciate what the powers are . #% This is an important step that matches the regulatory regime with the realities of a global car industry . #% This debate should now be finished and persons on the list should be recalled to speak . #% That is programmed by instructions and it is perfectly sensible for companies that have technical innovations encompassing that software to be able to protect it . #% Whilst conference leaders congratulated themselves on a transparent and bottom-up process , there are no records or minutes of these meetings . #% The weight of history is now being used as a potent weapon to arouse popular resentment against President Gbagbo and France . #% However , I invite him to indicate the Council 's willingness to enter into a debate with Parliament on our closer collaboration in relation to the annual report itself when he replies to this debate . #% A reasonable return on investment is important and should be taken into consideration . #% With the adoption of the GSM standard in mobile telecommunications , we have seen how important pre-competitive work is in setting in place the standards , protocols , and architecture for the next and evolving stage of communications . #% We consider it as a joint objective . #% It would be helpful if you added at the end of the sentence that it discussed them without coming to a conclusion . #% It is time to set that blame aside . #% I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well , because it is a problem which rightly , in this amendment , relates to interinstitutional matters . #% The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy fully supports the Commission 's reforms , which have increased its effectiveness and efficiency of delivery in the field of foreign affairs . #% Of course , we in Europe do not seek to attach conditions to our help , but we do join with the many Iranians whose lives have been saved in wanting and expecting free and fair elections for their country . #% Over 120 000 people were injured , and the survivors and the children born since then are still suffering appalling injuries , symptoms and disabilities . #% There are times when it is so frustrating trying to get the message through that we waste our time having conciliation meetings . #% It is tremendously important that the very little amount of money we have should be spent efficiently and effectively . #% Indeed , in the present climate where American airlines enjoy massive financial handouts , tax breaks and state aid , it is grossly unfair to expect Europe 's airlines to survive , let alone compete , when they are currently compelled to pay for new increased security measures . #% Commissioner , thank you for the enormous support and commitment you have made to Wales at a very difficult time with the job losses in the steel industry . #% Does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height ? #% No elector voted for Mr Newton Dunn , or indeed for me or for Mr Heaton-Harris . #% That is all very generous . #% You will not have heard this from me before , Commissioner , but in that regard we will need additional resources . #% I would refer you to the ratification declaration by the French government which states that `` The Government of the French Republic considers that the term ' `` armed conflict '' in Article 8 paragraphs 2 ( b ) and ( c ) , in and of itself and in its context refers to a situation of a kind which does not include the commission of ordinary crimes , including acts of terrorism , whether collective or isolated . '' #% We also need to bear in mind that the GSP system was designed for the least-developed countries . #% We have seen that we can raise undue expectations by what is written in EU law particularly , in this instance , about the availability of compensatory mechanisms . #% Why can we not have access to the texts ? #% 
We in this House should drive through the e-commerce directive with its country of origin principle as fast as we possibly can . #% All of us , whatever our creed , nationality , or political viewpoint , lost an irreplaceable piece of the common heritage that binds us together on this earth . #% I want to see her strong and powerful . #% author . - Mr President , here we are again examining the sticking plaster and wondering if it is large enough and strong enough to cover the wound . #% To set the picture straight : I may be a British Conservative , but I am not the contemporary equivalent of the hard-faced men who made money out of the war . #% I salute Mr Schnellhardt for his report and diligence . #% So we welcome the reintroduction of our amendments on eco-innovation , for example , because we think that is indicative of the choices we have to make if we want to create a sustainably developed economy . #% Should we not listen to her in the way that we did not listen to the calls from the ANC in South Africa for economic sanctions during those apartheid days ? #% Is it a priority of the Commission ? #% I am not entirely sure that we got it right . #% The truth is , we can not take the numbers . #% I welcome Paragraph 19 of the Barcelona summit conclusions and look forward to the new interinstitutional approach , which we hope will install regulatory impact assessments applicable to the work of all European Union institutions . #% We are tired of the linkage of various directives in this package , with the excuse that we can not look for a review of the European Works Council Directive until it has been further bedded-in and the European company statute is in place . #% The draft agreement allows for the Council to decide to invite Turkey to play a part where NATO facilities are not required . #% But the Council has failed to speak out against Guantanamo Bay internment and is trying to impose an agreement with the US on air passenger data transfers in breach of European data protection laws . #% Although it is true that some 68 states have destroyed more than 31.5 million mines , it is estimated that 78 countries still have between 200 and 250 million antipersonnel mines stockpiled , that tragically there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 new landmine victims per year and that landmines still litter 82 countries around the world . #% Standards are part of that , not just in Europe but also in the world as a whole . #% Dialogue is the way forward . #% If you look at the Haug report , Parliament wants to find a solution . #% Of course I understand the need for financial integrity , but the Court of Auditors made it perfectly clear that over-complication has very often been the cause of the problem , and likewise I certainly understand that management and interpretation of regulations varies far too much from one nation to another . #% The Commission proposals and Parliament 's response give a clear acknowledgement that the market can and should be the motor for much of this change , but not in every case . #% We expect the Commission to spend the money on responding to crises by buying medicines , hiring doctors or nurses , chartering aircraft to carry the medicines , nurses or policemen - whatever is required - to the crisis , wherever it is - not necessarily within Europe . #% I should like to welcome the BBC staff working here in Strasbourg who , in tribute to their missing colleague , are in the public gallery today to listen to our debate . #% It is not the primary function of this parliament to produce extensive and controversial additions to current legislation and extra channels of redress on an assumption that these should automatically be acceptable simply because they have been proposed . #% However , the protection also has to involve the children themselves . #% Those of us who belong to the delegation were reassured by the promise we had from Commissioner Van Miert to try to work towards closer relationships between competition authorities on both sides . #% My final two points are again on the language items , firstly regarding full controlled multilingualism . #% We need full implementation , for example , of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . #% The renamed Economic and Financial Committee should tilt the balance back to a proper equilibrium . #% The very fact that we find that we can not support some of its conclusions does not seem to me to invalidate the underlying exercise . #% Kidnapping is a crime that leads also to child slavery , to human prostitution internationally , and to child soldiers , as well as to the miseries you have already commented on in Iraq . #% Secondly , as regards work on the agency - which Mrs Haug has so ably coordinated for us - we are putting sums of money of the increases in reserves so that we can hear views from the agencies as to what they will be doing with their money and their work programmes in order to get value for money once again . #% With some 14 % of all public investment in metropolitan France represented in this programme , it demonstrates , beyond doubt , the value of the safety net , which we argued for in the next programming period , to avoid a sudden disappearance of this very significant level of support . #% However , whilst we fully support the integration of the Roma people within the European Union , we do have serious misgivings with regard to the involvement of the European Union on issues which we believe to be the preserve of individual nation states , such as access to health care , education , employment and housing . #% We have to devise new methods to keep young people in rural areas . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Mr Maat for bringing forward a very practical report on animal transport , because it is absolutely sure that we all want to see animal transport tightened up . #% He is currently awaiting deportation for , and I quote , ' reasons of national security and other reasons of a political nature , namely the fight against international terrorism ' . #% Instead of some of the more far-reaching proposals suggested to us , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a modest revision of Rule 47 ( which would be renamed ` Procedure with associated committees ' ) . #% We have not got it right . #% Terrorists and organised criminals use modern technology while we , in this House , argue and debate whether our police and intelligence services should have access to the same tools and the same technology . #% For the same reasons I have no objection in principle to trophy hunting , although I can not understand the mentality of rich people who want to kill great creatures . #% What we have achieved together is something rather remarkable : we have changed the political discourse in Europe , we have established a constitutional framework for a Europe that can stand on its own feet in world affairs and deliver effective common policy to address our shared problems . #% We have made progress , but not enough . #% Second , how far we can specifically assist developing countries in meeting EU standards . #% Therefore , we must be very clear in rejecting any amendments that try to do that . #% The EPLP would also like to emphasise that the EU is founded on clear principles of human rights , and therefore it is essential for all Member States and acceding countries to respect minority rights and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights . #% There is even a case for substitution on the 34-person EFC . #% When the UK introduced its worker registration scheme for nationals of the A8 countries , it found that 40 % of the Polish people who registered were already in the UK . #% We must be vigilant to ensure it is implemented thoroughly and urgently . #% He has succeeded in bringing parliamentarians together on this issue and he deserves warm congratulations . #% But it also means better exchange of information between the parties concerned , so that blacklists of both fishing and fish transport vessels can be disseminated and the possibility of converting to a white list through reflagging can be avoided . #% Proposals for rest hours will mean increased cost to the consumer and industry alike , reduced services and , in some cases , no service at all . #% Only one country in the EU -- the Netherlands -- has completed its designation of special areas for conservation . #% The proposal is indeed needed to set EU-wide minimum standards on the use of human tissues and cells . #% Otherwise we can only conclude , if they maintain their position , that this is really a subterfuge for opening up a political process that as yet we have not agreed . #% This is an extremely important initiative that goes right to the very heart of the societal change that is engulfing our world at the moment . #% The common position also includes a number of unusual features such as the committee in question would adopt its own procedure which is not in accordance with Decision 87/373 and the Commission may consult the committee on any new situations . #% Usually these perceptions are misconceived - the result of gross distortion of facts by tabloid newspapers . #% Those who are opposed to the system would be satisfied that it does not immediately become obligatory and an essential part of the acts to be adopted . #% I want to ask the Commissioner for information about exactly which NGOs he is referring to and I would also like to know whether any contact has been made with those NGOs during the last six months . #% Mr President , we can argue whether a 5 % ratio of fin weight to body weight is appropriate or whether a larger proportion is needed . #% There are serious political consequences , and we are now preparing to draw our conclusions . #% We must learn the lessons too , for despite the early announcement of assistance which we welcome , no international aid had arrived locally a full 48 hours after the earthquake struck . #% I would like to thank both the Commission for their very good document and also Mrs Schmidbauer for her very sensitive and thoughtful report . #% In the meantime we ask that the Commission , the Council and the Member States continue to put pressure on the King and his administration to respond positively , making it clear that any failure to respond will mean the isolation of the current regime , accompanied by smart sanctions . #% We are somewhere near to getting an agreement on that through Mrs Haug 's report . #% 
I also congratulate the coalition government in place since last September . #% We must be mindful of this sad fact and try to deliver what we can for the real world that we face . #% I want to illustrate the situation by referring to my own country , but the situation is the same across the European Union . #% That is a very impressive title , but I am not too sure that the report was that positive . #% It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament . #% The reduction of costs for so many people and businesses is a very useful contribution to peoples ' private pockets , as well as business costs . #% Thirdly , drug treatment must be accessible and affordable : we must keep the pressure on the USA to stick to the agreements made on TRIPS , patent rights , production and differential pricing . #% I believe that we have to have a level playing field for hauliers across the EU , because they travel across borders all the time . #% I refer not to the World Cup , the final of which will have been contested between England and Ireland long before 6 July , but to the tour de France . #% I am sympathetic to Mr Santos ' view that the cyclically adjusted deficit approved over the economic cycle is both sensible and prudent . #% Capacity-building efforts must focus on the poorest states , enabling them to use funds effectively . #% I would also point out to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries that it is his resolution which complains about the Commission and not ours . #% The peoples of Europe want peace , freedom and security . #% Does Parliament condone violations of the right to a fair trial , freedom of expression , and freedom of association whether it be social , political , religious or sexual ? #% There are also those who are concerned about the idea of direct access to the data and the question as to whether there are sufficient guarantees for the protection of the data and the protection of citizens , and whether we are setting a dangerous precedent here . #% Mr President , the fortnightly retrial in Libya of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor -- ongoing since 13 June -- resumes again tomorrow . #% We are introducing a bill , hailed as a model across Europe , to modernise contract law to take account of e-commerce . #% Mr President , this debate comes at a very timely moment in the history of Indonesia , given the very grave situation in the province of Aceh . #% However , there is a perception among some Member States - or there is a danger of such a perception - that they benefit to a lesser extent than others . #% It is not unlike the situation in 1994 , I have to say , or for the 1994 Budget , where we went right through to December before we knew what the final situation would be . #% This House must show its full maturity and restraint tomorrow , vote for the essential and deliver a Members ' Statute for the European Parliament . #% So I hope that Amendment No 10 will play some part in ensuring that this regrettable development stops . #% But I also want to pick up the broader issue because I think , as a number of my colleagues have said , the issue here is not just about the regulation ; it is about the whole supply chain for toys , much of which come from outside the European Union . #% Security is an aspect of freedom because no-one who is unsafe is free , but freedom is also an element in security and no-one is secure if their privacy is invaded or they are wrongly imprisoned or subject to discrimination . #% The debate on protectionism goes to the heart of the debate on future economic development . #% Let us endorse it '' . #% In Basildon , Braintree , Chelmsford , Colchester , Epping Forest and Rochford , our county council in Essex currently plans eight new major waste facilities , including incinerators , over-providing by some six times local waste generated , according to Friends of the Earth . #% Secondly , how do these organisations get access to funds ? #% The first was OLAF , Europe 's anti-fraud office . #% Those amendments recognised the reality that in the conditions of the 21st century European agriculture will be much less labour-intensive and more mechanised in almost all sectors . #% Every time I go there I have to go through the procedure of getting a visa and the Romanians say that as long as the European Union wants visas from them they will demand them from us . #% There would be no stronger way of expressing support for Turkey 's reformers than offering a schedule for the opening of the accession negotiations but only on the condition that the Turkish Cypriots were brought to accept the Annan proposals for a federated settlement of the problem of Cyprus . #% We assume that the next Justice and Home Affairs Council will be doing some of that . #% Nevertheless , I do not underestimate the scale of the tasks that will face those two countries after joining in 2007 . #% Let us hope that this small straw is the one that breaks the back of a very stubborn and blinkered camel which is the model of the nuclear industry as we see it to day . #% OIC members include Albania and Turkey , both of whom are signatories to the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights , which cites sharia as the basis for human rights in Muslim countries . #% That state of affairs , it seems , also applies to the courts which will hear the cases in Member States . #% The Committee has been entirely behind Mr Wynn in the stand he has taken over the years on this particular point . #% Future generations will come to wonder how they have flourished for so long . #% Since 1992 it has closed by only 1 percentage point . #% Mr Paasilinna , in his written contribution , posed the question who will regulate the regulator and I think that the role of the Commission is absolutely crucial in this . #% Mr Perry 's explanatory statement does not give a fair and balanced account of the circumstances surrounding the underwriting losses of Lloyd 's members in the 1980s . #% I thank the rapporteur for accepting two of my amendments in particular . #% In the 1980s I worked in a car factory there that employed 20 000 people ' . #% Mr President , as steps are being taken in the Middle East with the road map towards peace , I would like to draw the attention of the House to the welcome steps being made towards the same process in Kashmir and the recent steps taken by the governments of India and Pakistan in this regard . #% We should be reinforcing transatlantic solidarity , developing our joint capacities to tackle terrorism , to deal with the WMD threat and to deploy capable military forces wherever they might be needed . #% It is right that they are given priority , as they have been within the European Union since the 1996 Commission communication . #% I abstained in order to signal , on the one hand , my support for enlargement , and on the other , my firm and consistent opposition to the federalist agenda , to the Constitution , and to the bias against Northern Cyprus . #% Is that a majority of Members needing to accept that a party meets the conditions , or a majority of Members needing to challenge that a party no longer meets the necessary conditions ? #% The European Union has its own key policies and they are integration , integration and yet more integration . #% And I make the point , before I move to my questions , that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because , of course , the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions . #% Management personnel is what we need in the delegations . #% This is , of course , a violation of the equal treatment of EU citizens , enshrined in the Treaty . #% Such political progress will have tremendous significance , not just as regards relations between these two states , but as a stepping stone towards a normalisation of relations between Israel and the whole of the Muslim and Arab world . #% There is a tremendous amount of detailed analysis in this report and it clearly shows the consumer benefits in price reductions , choice and increased services that have flowed from deregulation . #% We are delighted at the extent to which ministers have engaged Parliament and particularly the extent to which the British Home Secretary has ensured that Parliament is involved in taking forward that security agenda . #% First of all - and this point will appear in the compromise resolution which is not yet in print but it is certainly in our own resolution - my colleague , Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne , points out that the United Nations is extremely slow , or has been in the past , to respond when there are reports of breaches of use of these weapons . #% What chance is there of real progress ? #% I hope that this will be respected . #% I was going to refer to the concern that we have about the progress that is not being made , but Parliament has not helped itself with that decision last night by the Bureau . #% Mr President , others have talked about the issue of dispute settlement specifically . #% It is important that we give financial support to Northern Cyprus , but that must be through the recognised democratic Government of the Republic of Cyprus . #% If only colleagues were as brief in asking their questions . #% Are we to interpret ` within a reasonable period ' to be before the end of 1999 or after ? #% Of course , threats to our security are threats to our freedom , but the reverse is also true . #% We should not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers . #% 
There have been simply too many examples of substandard conditions for prisoners , too many misplaced warrants and too great a lack of redress for those who have been victims of errors . #% One of my main concerns when addressing the topic is that Europe tries to act alone , making decisions which could potentially place EU airlines at a competitive disadvantage . #% In trying to address the issue of simplifying our hierarchy of acts in the European Union , Mr Bourlanges has taken a very complex , difficult subject and tried to bring a certain rationality to it . #% Commissioner , there is no facility for policemen across Europe to find contacts unless they already know them . #% We have to try and use the association agreement , as Commissioner Marin has indicated , in order to develop that dialogue and allow access to Algeria by non-governmental organizations that can begin to assess the reality of the situation there . #% So the new paragraph 7a would read : ` Hence , calls once again on the Commission to develop a comprehensive European Strategy for Roma Inclusion as the instrument for combating social exclusion and discrimination of Roma in Europe ' . #% The advantage of sticking with these modest targets is that they are absolutely realistic and attainable . #% Firstly , instead of referring to the facility in the context of CFSP and the Commission 's own first pillar external actions , it has been put into the context of the common security and defence policy . #% When the French and Dutch voted against the Constitution last year , we ignored their verdict . #% Mr President , I support the ideas behind the proposals in Mr De Rossa 's excellent report and congratulate him on it . #% I would make an urgent appeal , on behalf of these five people , for this action to be taken immediately . #% That is something that many professionals need to do . #% Those of us who raise social rights and rights at work as human rights are accused by some of resorting to the Stalinist demagogy which uses social or collective provision as an excuse for suppressing human rights . #% One of the issues over which we had quite a lot of debate with Mrs Echerer indeed Mr Karas referred to it , and much of what came from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and indeed from the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport was also included in our final vote is the question of the operation of the marketplace in connection with collective rights management . #% Could I begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work on this very important dossier , and by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission for bringing forward this proposal . #% I hope we can build on this and that Members will participate . #% Inevitably it will require some restructuring and a change of mindset . #% We need to release the frozen EDF monies . #% We can not blame the world situation for everything that is wrong with the European economy . #% We have been pleased to vote and to support this report even though , for a variety of reasons , the United Kingdom Government has exercised its right to opt out of this initiative . #% As we now look further forward to the 2008 and 2009 budget years , there is a lot of work to be done . #% They are only left with what they have to use for statutory duties . #% This election , as well as being free , fair and transparent , must also allow the option of long-term EU accession to be part of the Ukrainian people 's choice . #% Be in no doubt about that , this legislation would fall . #% How can our children be convinced of the real dangers of smoking when the EU devotes ECU 1 billion each year to assist the growing of its raw material ? #% Against the wishes of the Council , we have helped the Commission to increase its establishment plans by several hundred members of staff . #% It also requires Member States to create yet more criminal offences to regulate the commercial market . #% I would appreciate a statement from the Commissioner on that particular point . #% Energy supply is more elastic than demand . #% Therefore we need to create a climate that will allow those industries to thrive and to allow the small and medium-sized companies that form part of the supply chain also to thrive in the future . #% In the interests of transparency - and far be it from me to suggest that the Commission would not always want to be transparent on these issues - would the Commission do us the favour of publishing the formula it intends to adopt ? #% Mr President , the idea that is fundamental to the report that I am bringing forward is that the proposal from the European Commission for a recommendation on this subject should be changed to become a directive and , as you will see from my report , this secured near unanimous backing in the Environment Committee . #% Those working in the tourism industry know only too well the frustrations of moveable exchange rates . #% If the Spanish government disagrees it should consider what its response would be if Portugal were to insist on its treaty right to have Olivenca returned by Spain or Morocco were to insist on Ceuta and Mellila becoming theirs . #% So there I am , the candid friend to the State of Israel . #% Gay rights are now part of law , an anti-trafficking law has recently been passed and domestic violence law has gone through . #% We must now have overall integrated changes necessary to resolve the bulk of the problems currently arising from this regulation as soon as possible . #% I am very pleased that the Commissioner responsible for development has come in at this point as I wish to ask which Commission department -- Social Affairs or other -- will continue to lead in this area , and how coordination will continue within the Commission , because this issue cuts across many different departments there . #% In many cases we see far too many complicated texts coming out of work done by this House . #% Firstly , the Court of Auditors , in its annual report , makes repeated criticism of ` the accuracy and reliability of underlying transactions ' . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to congratulate Mrs Haug on her report , not just because she is from our group but because she embarked on a Mission Impossible to try to get the agreement of the European Parliament on the future financing of the European Union . #% I understand that the central objective of the EU is for each Member State to bring to the table its experience and skills , its best practice and ideas , share with the rest and strengthen all . #% As a result of that I learnt a lot about Somalia and Somaliland and I particularly learned what a complex area it is . #% Secondly , I am very pleased that the Commission has indicated informally that it will assist companies that suffer discrimination , informally taking up these matters with the Chinese directly and therefore avoiding the potential of lengthy and costly litigation . #% Of all the interested parties , do the travelling public not have a particular right of access to information about the safety of the vessel to which they entrust their lives and those of their families ? #% And what does it profit anyone to fish our waters out ? #% Meanwhile , I would just like to highlight three points from the report : paragraph 13 where we would like to see in next year the Commission report much more concrete evidence of the employment gains that this multiannual programme has produced , not because we doubt what those employment gains might be , but we would like to see some hard data next time around . #% We have a few voters here in the visitors ' gallery , but there are millions out there who do not know what we are doing and we need to communicate with them . #% ASEAN countries are pressuring the Union to lift that ban . #% I only have to apologise that I will be absent for tomorrow 's vote , as I will be attending the Labour Party Conference in Manchester . #% Standardization is by no means synonymous with simplification . #% We are facing a situation where we have a proliferation of organised crime on an international basis . #% The single market will never be delivered , and the ERTMS will never happen . #% To those - perhaps the British Conservatives - who will vote against this report in its entirety , if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies . #% Some of those things have been done , but I did not want this just to be a pat on the back for the Member States for having held conferences in major cities , or for them to say simply ` how wonderful we are to have had a European Year of People with Disabilities ' . #% I believe this is the sixth time that he will appear in court . #% Firstly , it is extraordinary that a Directive promulgated in 1986 has still not been properly implemented in some Member States . #% I know the problem here is largely the Commission , but it impacts on Parliament . #% This is not really the same as competition . #% Thirdly , bringing estuary crossings into this legislation would have added a considerable cost burden on operators , bringing into question the very viability of some of the operations . #% But it can also be important to have a stopgap solution without a legal vacuum pending that legislative procedure . #% We should at least however seek to ensure that no one is allowed to fall below a certain minimum and that the reasons for any differentials are clear . #% The definition should be restricted to CMR ( categories 1 and 2 ) , and POP substances , as defined in the Stockholm Convention . #% Fourthly , we must have greater clarity in financing the CFSP - particularly the difference between administrative and operational expenditure . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur , on behalf of the Socialist Group , for the way in which he has skilfully piloted this part of the Erika package through Parliament , keeping all sides together . #% In truth , without the WTO we would be unable to construct the global legal and regulatory architecture which is indispensable to any coherent political response to globalisation . #% 
We very much regret the confusion the rapporteur appears to have encountered in discharging her mandate . #% It is no surprise to you , I am sure , to see me rising on this issue even though my question is further on . #% Madam President , the authors of the resolution , the signatories of the joint resolution , were not consulted . #% If you are increasing qualified majority voting and therefore taking away the national veto , you are effectively transferring powers from the nation state to the European institutions . #% These reports call for free trade - which is good - but that must not be conditional on recreating the failing structures of the European Union . #% However , whenever I ask Commissioner van den Broek if Turkey is a candidate , he says the Commission regards Turkey as already being a candidate . #% Mr President , once again it is my pleasure to compliment Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on her emphatic pursuit of these consumer interests and the care she has taken over the amendments which we are presenting here at second reading . #% We defend some minorities but not others . #% I personally consider that Mr Prodi has weakened his position and the Commission 's position by stepping into Italian domestic politics , which is something I am sure he should not be doing . #% As a UK farmer , I will rely on veterinary recommendation and not the opinion of bureaucrats in other countries . #% Those pretending to understand the benefits/disbenefits of the rebate query whether or not it is more correct and efficient for countries to make direct use of EGAF monies at local level . #% It is clear that we need fair , multilaterally agreed rules to oversee and regulate trade in the interests of poverty eradication . #% I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging , and I suspect that all those who concluded , in response to the Commission 's own consultation , that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission , the due-diligence system on its own , as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face . #% Let me close today by expressing my hope that support in the European Council for economic freedom and reform will be substantially reinforced in the weeks ahead - I hope also , perhaps , helped by a new Conservative Government in the United Kingdom . #% It is for that reason that it was necessary then to review the Rules . #% That means - I hope Mrs McKenna is listening - that everything is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-war demonstrations across the European Union . #% The values that he espouses are the best hope for freedom , peace and democracy for China and the world and it is fitting that he has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his efforts and his sacrifices . #% It is very easy to be wise in hindsight . #% If they do not buy a product that is produced in the European Union because we have banned various chemicals , they will buy it from outside and this will put our farmers at a disadvantage . #% Last May we were in Uzbekistan , the beautiful and historic country of Tamburlaine . #% The proposed new law is a serious assault on both . #% What we need is a radical overhaul , as the Commissioner proposed . #% If you are not knocked unconscious , do you know where you are ? #% The EU 's series of ill-considered directives stand in the way of a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy emerging in the Member States . #% I am sure you welcome , as all of us hopefully in this House will , the announcement in yesterday 's Financial Times that a number of business leaders will be launching a CSR academy in INSEAD Fontainebleau this coming Friday . #% Mr President , since we last met we have seen the arrest of former President Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia and the rather shabby treatment which has been dished out to him . #% He tried in vain to persuade our committee to support the thrust of the Commission proposals . #% Astonishingly , the self-confessed perpetrator of this crime , Shamil Basayev , was appointed deputy prime minister of the so-called Chechen government-in-exile on 25 August . #% I believe that people in this House know that my occupation of time is , generally speaking , very disciplined . #% However , the Conference of Presidents has made a decision , which I accept , and I offer my full support to Mr Brok , whose work and qualities we know . #% These concerns centred around the levels of compensation not being related to the cost of tickets , which could have serious implications for budget carriers , but more importantly , the deletion of the clause relating to which render airlines liable to pay compensation in circumstances genuinely beyond their control . #% I wonder can you say what progress is being made in the Commission in bringing those forward so that we can take the practical measures which you are talking about . #% The British Socialist delegation ( EPLP ) voted in favour of the Cavada report and the EP 's resolution on the progress made in the EU towards the area of freedom , security and justice ( AFSJ ) ( Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty ) because we support any actions to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the EU institutions and their capacity to deliver for our citizens in the field of Justice and Home Affairs . #% The volume of programmes dedicated to this in the annual programme lends a suitable importance to those areas because they can provide us with the solid basis that we will need in order to be able to face the challenges we are now presented with . #% Madam President , I am last but not least and I hope I shall not take three minutes . #% I do not share entirely the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues as to the safety of GMOs . #% You could not give a damn about the referendum results in France and in the Netherlands last year . #% I hope that we were able to contain this , going forward . #% I remember the Commissioner telling us not long ago that under his regime we would have less interference of the kind which angers many European citizens for no good reason . #% One area where we need to move forward is the link between the Council and the Parliament . #% Perhaps the Commissioner could clarify that . #% There are only two people in DG VIII who are responsible for operational coordination and only one person in DG I B , and we are looking at a decrease in the number of staff in delegations to individual countries . #% One of the greatest threats at the moment is the flu pandemic . #% The title of the report we are discussing appears to concern the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund but the comments of the rapporteur went very much wider than that subject . #% Is next year , with enlargement , with the new Constitution , with elections , a year when the information will be more necessary than usual ? #% We want all recognised legitimate and traditional alcoholic products incorporated within it . #% Mr President , I rise under Rule 145 to make a short personal statement following the remarks made by the Presidency in a debate yesterday , which I find unhelpful and not positive at all . #% MONUC , the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Congo , was supposed to disarm and neutralise the rebels , but has failed to do so . #% So extreme were the quotes from the Turkish Government as a result of the summit , I was really concerned that something had gone seriously wrong in the summit . #% We regret that certain Members of this House seem to feel that it is acceptable not to regard those seeking asylum and other forms of protection as having equal rights in terms of social security and other forms of security in the workplace . #% I would again like to thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done . #% Moreover , we never approve of EU regulation . #% However , when he presented it at a hospital in France , the specialist he saw ripped it up and came to a private agreement with him that he should pay a fee , instead of advising him that he should go to the appropriate office to get reimbursement . #% How do we square the circle of the Pact for Stability and Growth and bearing down on borrowing and budget deficits with the need to increase investment in the European Union . #% The new directive is intended to set up a new system for deciding the criteria for asylum seekers : who can and can not enter Member States and qualify for refugee status and under what conditions . #% If present trends continue , over half the pollution produced in the EU will be out at sea . #% We are not prepared , however , to accept the budgetary straight-jacket that the German Finance Minister is trying to impose on us within the European Union . #% The potential problems - particularly the problems of water pollution - are cross-boundary problems and therefore worthy of European-wide legislation . #% Yes , Israel must withdraw from the territories which it has occupied these past few weeks . #% Here is an opportunity for action . #% We must increase our resolve to deal with the displaced people . #% Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the peace agreement signed a Accra on 18 August 2003 under the authority of ECOWAS , the Economic Community of West African States . #% Having listened to his answer to the previous question , I see direct similarities when we talk about looking at discriminatory practice . #% It is vitally important to curb illegal immigration and to deal with the criminals who are exploiting poor people to their own advantage , both financially and in other ways . #% That is a warning signal which we can not ignore . #% 
I said then , and I say again now , that as far as the Council is concerned hell will freeze over before it agrees to a new flexibility instrument . #% At the moment , the decision of many millions of them is to use the opt-out . #% Mr President , it is not in any sense part of my job this morning to answer comments made by previous speakers . #% Can you , Madam Vice-President/High Representative , put pressure on Turkey to stop this dangerous provocation at a time when Israel is under enormous tension and pressure , with missile attacks from Gaza and the renewed passage of Iranian warships through the Suez Canal ? #% There will be a whole new environment pushing towards multilateral action . #% If people in the candidate countries and the existing countries do not understand enlargement , then we shall only have repeats of the problems that we experienced in Ireland . #% Could somebody please tell the electorate in Great Britain whether these two people are now members of the Conservative Party or whether they are now independents ? #% However , in a debate being held in May 1998 , surely the benefit of time can allow us to draw a wider conclusion about what happens when the programme in effect starts three years late . #% A majority supports this Constitution , even in countries which held referendums . #% Please could I get mine removed and have extra office working space instead ? #% Usually these were armed rebel groups in developing countries with no concern for human life and they had been supplied by non-western countries . #% It is neither as hallowed nor as sexy as an IGC , but until we get the actual delivery mechanisms of democracy and public policy right , the boring , tedious administrative detail , then we do democracy an injustice . #% I start my speech with this bleak assessment because in our proper desire to support the Commission in their barrier-free Europe communication , and Mrs Hermange , in her excellent response , we risk forgetting the very real exclusion from every aspect of public life which is the daily reality for disabled people in our societies . #% The war on terrorism has intervened and the whole criminal justice area has become paramount , but should it be to the exclusion of civil justice , which merits just one paragraph and no new initiatives or even consultations in this programme ? #% Where the Council has suggested that this might be against the Financial Regulation , I think Article 43 ( 1 ) ( b ) makes it quite clear that where there are sufficient grounds for us to put monies in the reserve , then we are entitled to do so . #% We should also recognize that this is not just an important economic directive , but also one that is important for the protection of the environment and public health . #% We welcome it and it is right that he should be gently leading us into the 21st century in this respect . #% The final point I would like to make relates to the transport dossier . #% There are many reasons which have been explored today , but a big reason is that the markets do not believe in a currency without a country . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Turco and my colleague Mr Sousa Pinto for their important reports which show the essential work the agencies are doing through their investigations into how drugs actually function , their effect , the impact on society and which describe what help and improvements can be made . #% However , I could not help thinking while listening to the many detailed questions that we have heard that perhaps more of what I and my colleagues have been dealing with could have been dealt with at an earlier stage in the Committees , to give us a more strategic debate here today . #% Secondly , tourists - the consumers . #% I can now say to the President they have indeed been successful . #% Many leave developing countries -- as you said , Commissioner -- because in developing countries they earn low wages , have poor working conditions , little prospect of advancement and a lack of training . #% Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Karas , and the Commissioner and his staff for what I believe is a very good compromise reached between the European Parliament , the Council of Ministers and the Commission , which will allow millions of Europeans to accumulate better pension rights wherever they work in the Union . #% Fundamentally and finally , is she prepared to compromise to find solutions , if the undertakings being given by government or the work being undertaken by governments takes longer than we would wish ? #% So I agree with the compromise position which has been outlined this evening , which calls for indicative targets with the Commission able , at a later date , to introduce mandatory targets if we feel progress is not being made . #% Indeed , it will help in our very own action plan to face head-on the issue of terrorism within our own borders . #% It also underlines the role of the Agency as a risk observatory . #% Council will remember its recommendation on the active inclusion of those furthest from the labour market where high-quality public services are seen as crucial . #% If these incinerators are not used , people may well have to go back to burial . #% . Mr President , over the past decade we have seen a massive transformation of Bulgaria , hauling itself out of a Communist past and now on track for accession to the European Union by 2007 . #% If we look at the Romeva i Rueda report , some of its provisions would simply be counterproductive if adopted . #% We do not believe in EU style harmonisation ! #% In fact , there are plenty of people on this list who will vote ` Yes ' to the Constitution and who believe in the European project . #% Landmines and their suspected presence are one of the greatest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of normality . #% If one of my constituents who has been caught by the new rule and whose marriage is accepted by the government moves to France , she would have the right to have her husband with her . #% For communication to be successful you have to listen . #% The report is particularly good - indeed it is its main strength - on the measures needed to combat any future outbreak . #% Perhaps she could take a gentle message back asking him to turn up in future . #% Meanwhile at Council level the 133 Committee meets behind closed doors . #% I know that all of you have benefited for the last 30 years , but I apologise in advance . #% Just very quickly ; I very much regret the difficulty your constituent had . #% The benefits of ending this derogation are unclear . #% This will also , however , require real improvement in the area of human rights . #% This discussion is probably one of the most important that we will have before enlargement . #% A couple of months ago I was at an important meeting in Brussels , with representatives from the developing world talking about electronic communications and how they want to build their infrastructures . #% Secondly , it agreed to take the data retention proposals as first-pillar legislation under codecision rather than as an intergovernmental third-pillar fix , as some other governments wanted . #% I fear that many colleagues here today have underestimated the vested interests there are in some governments not to have an agreement , at least for the time being . #% Finally , on the issue for which I have been rapporteur , the guidelines : let us have an unequivocal assurance from the Commissioner that they will be published by the end of the year and they will not be used to impose late changes on local projects . #% Now that we have a further review and considering that many EU countries want their workers to have the choice to work more flexible hours , can President Barroso confirm that this Commission will propose a directive that respects national opt-outs from the 48-hour working week ? #% This is one of the essential market-opening principles of the internal market . #% Speaking for myself , an inquiry into the origins of CJD in the UK is long overdue and I shall do all I can to try to bring it about . #% But that would not fit into the niceties of the diplomatic language used in these conclusions . #% I wonder how long it is going to be before some of the developing countries overtake the poorest European countries . #% The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else 's responsibility to ensure the proper handling of these matters . #% The Government of Ethiopia continues to break international law as far as that is concerned . #% Let me quote from a letter I received from a constituent in Cornwall . #% Since the budget will become European Union operational on 1 January , will the budget for the Satellite Centre be part of the European security and defence budget , which the Council will put forward and which Parliament can debate and amend , as necessary ? #% It is important that we do not push further forward at a speed and rate we are not fully prepared for . #% I expect that it will vindicate British beef . #% The debate will need more structuring and more focus , perhaps along the lines on which Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Stubb spoke just now . #% Of course we must look at the causes of this situation and the crisis that occurred , and particularly at the application of Community law . #% It stretches credibility beyond belief to imagine that the British government could not have halted the delivery of these war planes which arrived only hours before Indonesian forces shot dead at least five demonstrators in Jakarta . #% Firstly , we need a successful European economy . #% It is a minority language , but its potential speakers are at least as numerous as those speakers of Maltese , an official language of the Community . #% 
In fact , between 1995 and 1997 we had about ECU 6m of real expenditure in that particular area . #% In its current form , this proposal is neither . #% The report rightly emphasizes the link between democracy and human rights , and the need for a universal concept which embraces the rights of national minorities , refugees , women and children , and the right to a healthy environment . #% There is no commitment to an early phase-out of textiles and garment quotas because of strong resistance from the United States . #% I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that , being left to grow year by year , it should be looked at very closely . #% Thirdly , we must communicate better with our citizens and give them the confidence that we are capable of running the budget effectively . #% On trade there are some huge political challenges ahead , not least the negotiation of the regional economic partnership agreements . #% The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address . #% I particularly welcome some of the amendments proposed by the committee , which state that the right to refugee status should be recognised rather than granted : refugee status is a legal right , not the gift of a benevolent regime . #% We said to the Belgian Presidency that there is no point whatsoever in having this directive if you allow this to happen . #% I have been selected as the nominee to chair the trade committee in the Joint Parliament Assembly between the EU and the ACP . #% Can I say something that I hope the Commission will take note of . #% They operate offshore and if we want to drive SMEs , the so-called engine of the new economy , out of the EU , then this is the way to do it . #% However , it is inappropriate to talk of an EU seat , as the UN Charter does not allow for organisations such as the EU to become members . #% That is why Parliament this year is seeking to earmark this spending and promote it as part of the deconcentration of staff and in the new country strategy papers . #% How would it help to stop funding human rights NGOs in Israel ? #% We are now paying for mistaken judgments within the European Union institutions . #% The clearest illustration of the problem is the fact that , in the face of today 's economic and monetary challenges , we simply do not have the tools we need . #% But above all else , we need to work together , exchanging information , assisting each other to deal with these ongoing threats , the undoubted threats to our freedom and to our democracy . #% This legislation encourages smaller vehicles , creating greater congestion , emissions and expense . #% I would hope that with the good cooperation of all three institutions this issue can be put to rest in the not too distant future , to make the Council happy , to make ourselves happy and to make sure that the Commission can get on with doing the job that it wants to do . #% However , we asked you to hold off from voting on the legislative resolution to give us the opportunity , as rapporteurs , to negotiate with the Council and the Commission to sustain Parliament 's position . #% Second , we are not seeking to stop mergers , transfers , restructuring or globalisation itself . #% Aquaculture is of such major importance to Scotland where many fragile local economies depend upon it . #% I believe that it is totally unnecessary : we always have to careful about bureaucracy . #% Last year Kenya lost 3000 graduate nurses to other countries , mostly to the United States and the United Kingdom . #% Secondly , as many countries told the US that rather than reject the ICC outright it should go along the Article 98 point 2 road , is it not difficult to criticise them for doing so ? #% Therefore , the key is to get prioritisation , to make the system workable , to protect health , to reduce the number of animal tests and to achieve it all in ten years . #% Of course , if the average is 1 % there will have been times when that 1 % was exceeded . #% We can not allow that item to jeopardise or weaken Agenda 2000 . #% Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Petitions , which , although it can not be described as a large spending committee , has an important role : to protect the rights of citizens who appeal to this Parliament to look after their rights . #% The other side of the problem is too few fish . #% We obviously need large areas to be closed off for fishing part of the year or , in some cases , permanently or near enough permanently , to allow the stocks to recover and to allow the juvenile stocks to grow . #% Exclusion may truly be the only answer , but this Parliament wants to try a little bit more to see if we can not resolve this . #% Let us stop this silly nonsense from people with no experience of the armed forces at all ! #% I should like you to answer one final question . #% I now find that the Conference of Presidents has called an extraordinary meeting this morning to meet President Santer to discuss the Commission 's work programme . #% To give just one example , in 2005 the British Serious Fraud Office investigated the involvement of a British company in the Serb state power company following allegations that corrupt money was being used to protect war criminals . #% Can the Commissioner call upon the European Commission delegation to the United Nations , on behalf of all of us , to make very strenuous representations to strengthen the fight by the United Nations against this particularly heinous form of crime ? #% Mr President , it is a very great joy that we have at last a report from the Council of Ministers on human rights . #% We are looking for a genuine pan-European single market . #% We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in overseeing these trade negotiations and promoting their transparency . #% Like others I regret the legal base chosen . #% The Commissioner and his services have been working closely with me and Parliamentary colleagues in recent weeks to ensure agreement on how to deliver this through the budget . #% Madam President , the arrest of Anwar Ibrahim , former Deputy Prime Minister and heir apparent to Mahathir Mohamad , along with 11 associates , demonstrates the short shrift that is given to democratic freedoms and human rights in Malaysia today . #% The proposal is based on the same mechanism that has been used in previous termination of service regulations related , for instance , to successive enlargements of the Union or to renewal of responsibilities in the on research directorate-general . #% I ask the Commission to answer these questions today , and to get its internal scaremongers under control . #% There are real concerns about his detention , trial and sentencing , which were , I believe , miscarriages of justice . #% Mr President , we are doing very well to be here at just after half past eleven on a Wednesday evening when we could probably be doing other , rather more pleasurable things . #% When , in future , production rights are changed , I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers . #% So I think the sites , when they are up and running , will have a huge benefit for Europe and will be something that people will be able to come to and enjoy , and will promote the idea of Europe and what we in Parliament and the EU are doing . #% Of course , the architect of all of this , Giscard , wanted , from this constitutional treaty , for the European Union to have a big , global voice , but I am afraid the leaders have suffered from a collective loss of nerve . #% I was delighted to hear it . #% Mr President , I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report . #% It also holds out the possibility of reducing artificial agricultural inputs , notably pesticides and herbicides , whose use can cause collateral environmental damage . #% It is a very challenging target . #% Parliament needs to know which Member States agree , and which disagree , with its position . #% Above all , I call for a change in the common agricultural policy culture . #% But we could at least ensure that our citizens understand what we are doing in their name . #% There is a minority - albeit it a very small minority - of people who may want to exploit for illegal and violent purposes the freedom of movement that this report facilitates . #% It is unthinkable that universal suffrage in a democracy will not be achieved in the end . #% It is the people that will pay the price for their leaders ' ambitions . #% Between 1990 and 2003 , the EU 's international aviation emissions increased by 73 % , corresponding to an annual growth of over 4 % . #% European sugar prices currently stand at nearly three times the world price , and these artificially high prices must be reduced . #% I find it difficult , however , that when we are talking about human rights in the subcommittee , we are told that we can not look at abuses within the EU . #% This view sees the IMF , the World Bank and the WTO handling the serious economic business whilst relegating social affairs alone to the UN . #% 
This Parliament is looking to the Council to take the issue of competitiveness seriously . #% It does no harm , it does some good . #% Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision , presently provided by their local cantons . #% Hence , also , the overall resolution to demand of the World Bank that it withdraw its support for our so-called project which would mean the movement of some 60,000 Chinese into an area currently populated by 4,000 Tibetans making a living with their herds , and the exploitation of Tibet 's natural resources . #% I am quite sure that we will show exactly that same resolve when this goes to conciliation as I am sure it will . #% The Chertoff vision is of data-mining and profiling on the basis of past and assumed future behaviour and stereotypes of potential terrorists . #% But we have to recognise that , especially for lesser-known diseases , public funding will be essential and I believe that the EU should include this in its programmes . #% It seems to me quite normal that we should do so in the context of the Union of tomorrow . #% I would like to start by agreeing with the last speaker . #% This will probably be my last budget as Chairman - I hear one or two boos at the back there - but I am looking forward to seeing this budget through . #% Thirdly , there is a view that there was a chronic lack of information on the ground about the Stability Pact . #% When consumers go to the supermarket to buy chicken , it has to be clearly labelled . #% In Croatia , as we know , President Tudjman 's recent speech to his party congress , the situation in eastern Slavonia and the way in which the Dayton Agreement is not being enforced effectively all indicate that the international community must not drop its guard in the region . #% The implication of this is that the United Kingdom and France should give up their seats in the Security Council and make way for an EU representative . #% I have grave doubts about the proposals for a system of patent courts that would be at arm 's length both from democratic institutions and from proper judicial review . #% Also , I was wondering whether you knew of the timetable that the Council was thinking of because it is absolutely important that we get the timetable through very quickly because after all those healthcare workers have waited so many years . #% We would encourage you , Commissioner , and your team to pay close attention to this whole transposition , to make sure that we get the maximum benefit from this very important piece of legislation . #% But I feel the main responsibility lies with the Commission . #% To have turned the distinct and fragmented markets of the Member States into a single European market is an extraordinary and revolutionary change . #% Clearly , the ECJ was correct to conclude that this is not a short-term project , although the jury may still be out on the word temporary . #% Lastly , coming from a country whose government is recalcitrant as far as consumer organizations being able to bring class actions in the courts is concerned , I welcome that possibility that is now available in all Member States . #% That needs to be taken into consideration in all Commission actions for the future . #% I can not condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens . #% Recent events over Iraq have questioned the viability of the CFSP . #% Mr President , it is very interesting that our Portuguese colleagues have brought this to our attention and we have had many contributions from them . #% The market is the most effective regulator , providing the best protection for consumers and giving consumers more power than any number of Commission consultation groups . #% The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society , its current growth rate is completely unsustainable . #% This is an enlightened and balanced report , which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism ; it promotes a vision of peace , coexistence , friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model . #% One of those problems is the proposal for 10 % of seats to be set aside for transnational European lists . #% It was launched in this Parliament to much acclaim and it was a total and utter crippling failure , even before the global recession hit . #% Morgan Tsvangirai has been arrested as has his deputy Welshman Ncube . #% I can certainly see the direct and straightforward arguments for setting such tests . #% There are also issues where inappropriate demands are made on a list of issues or concern idle threats to reject Council negotiations . #% in writing . - I support the Elles report on the draft amending budget No 5/2007 . #% Consumers are concerned about security , particularly with cross-border transactions . #% However , harmonisation of tax structures is not the way to achieve this : better design , cleaner fuels and research into alternative fuels are the way forward , not a half-baked attempt to extend the competence of the EU into tax . #% I just like to draw the Council 's attention to the fact that there are increasing social problems and increasing tension in Nicaragua including the problem of street children . #% Consequently , any measures taken in this regard should be consistent with the overall strategy against organised crime . #% Less sound is his proposal that a single private sector organization might have been entrusted with the responsibility for issuing such encrypted money . #% What will all this mean to our citizens ? #% We are trying to do three positive things . #% However , the Commission is also looking at ways of improving the procedure for the notification of national implementing measures as an extension of the IDA programme for the interchange of data between administrations . #% The issue of in-flight security does not belong in this regulation . #% This insistence on the so-called ` prudent person rule ' - the rule that investments are decided prudently - will open up the fund management market . #% We are special . #% Competition is needed between ports , not within them . #% You can therefore imagine the cynicism with which I read this proposal for special technical measures to improve the conservation situation in the Baltic Sea . #% I have four specific questions to Commissioner Monti concerning that . #% If we can organize our ICT policies well , this could give us an important competitive advantage because we will have integrated European information and communication technologies . #% But also it shows that when that leadership is absent Europe has to be able to have the capacity to act to preserve the security of its own continent . #% I ask Commissioner Byrne to review the whole slaughter policy for BSE in the EU . #% There are a number of areas that are important about this particular report such as the fact that we have included high-speed passenger craft . #% Over the coming months and years , time in the plenary will be at a premium and it is undoubtedly right that Mr Crowley 's report gives us the opportunity to be more flexible , to be more rational and to be more successful . #% Could I ask when you will report back to the plenary on that ? #% I wish tentatively to welcome proposals which are anticipated from the Commission to provide a goodwill package of economic assistance , along with measures apparently to lift the embargo . #% By 2015 , 471 million of them will be living in extreme poverty . #% The aim of these proposals is to improve air quality and protect human health . #% I have no problem at all , Commissioner , with the agreement on managing area 2J3KL . #% While Eurobonds may be regarded as a clever idea which can deliver funds to governments , there seems no legal base on which this can be achieved , so it looks unlikely that this option can be exercised . #% The GUE/NGL Group , which tabled the amendment , is content with that . #% Last year , the Council proposed a 10 % across-the-board cut in Category 4 . #% I know that the Secretariat has also declared a number of the amendments to be out of order for various reasons and this has caused concern among many colleagues . #% For example , ship emissions contribute to critical loads of acidity being exceeded by more than 50 % in most of the coastal areas along the English Channel and the North Sea , in the Baltic Sea along the coast of Germany and Poland , and also in large parts of southern Sweden and Finland . #% That is a grievance in the United Kingdom ; that the rules seem constantly to be changing . #% I am particularly grateful that both the Commission proposal and the report recognise the practicalities of transporting animals in remote and island regions , such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland . #% We endorse many of the proposals in the Szejna report on developments in and prospects for company law , in particular , the need to apply better regulation principles , the necessity to take account of the needs of SMEs and the importance of developing best practice which respects the different traditions and systems of Member States . #% 
It would be easier for it to be delivered if people abandoned some of the rhetorical tricks they have been using this morning . #% Liberals believe decentralisation is essential if the Union is to manage its common policies more effectively . #% I was privileged to address the UN working group in Geneva on indigenous peoples and thus witnessed how it forms a world parliament for some of the most oppressed minorities anywhere in our world . #% It is decentralization which makes our aid more visible , thereby improving accountability . #% They suffer from social exclusion . #% After all , we were promised when the GATT agreement was supported by Parliament that there would be proper provision for the protection of the environment and animal welfare . #% I also believe Russia must be encouraged to join the Energy Charter to prevent it from stopping third countries using its pipelines . #% We look forward to further moves dealing with race hatred and xenophobia within the European Union . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr Barroso , we have enjoyed a series of pantomime exchanges on the euro . #% Mr President , I have two short minutes in which to make four points . #% In the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 , we rightly talked about priorities , but then we never acted on it . #% Even greater , therefore , is the responsibility upon us , the imperative to focus on how these interventions can be delivered to those who need them . #% But so far , not so good , because , as far as surveillance is concerned , we have established an early-warning system to detect airborne chemical agents , but its usefulness is limited , since it only operates for certain substances and would not guard against the contamination of water or food supplies . #% An attack upon the United States , an attack in Germany , an attack in Denmark , an attack in Madrid , an attack in the United Kingdom , or attempted attacks , are attacks upon every single one of us because we have common values . #% Mr President , I welcome the report for pointing us at the central question which is the method for revision of the treaties in the future . #% In particular , I want to draw attention to a number of points that have been highlighted by the Commission and which Mr Gasòliba has taken up in his own text . #% Co-Chairman of the EFD Group . - Mr Barroso , I am disappointed . #% Personally , I prefer the voluntary approach to adopting common standards in digital television technology rather than seeking to impose one solution . #% Other than in the most exceptional circumstances , eight hours on the road should be sufficient for slaughter and the recommendation in the report to promote the use of local slaughterhouses should make these circumstances less likely . #% Mr President , the rapporteur has come a long way in recent weeks in terms of dumping some of her more extreme amendments . #% The answer is Mr Suresh Rastogi , a Danish researcher who used the phthalates he happened to have in his laboratory . #% The Commission also needs to take a strong position to protect the ban . #% Women need no lectures from men in frocks , telling them what they should do with their bodies . #% Such interests are registered in the written declaration of Members ' interests , so they are there for the public to see ; that declaration will also soon be on the Internet following the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week . #% That is where the monetary speech comes in . #% Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point . #% Indeed the way the committee of inquiry conducted its work gave me such hope , that we could genuinely add to the lessons learnt , to combat and hopefully prevent any future outbreak . #% This issue is inextricably linked to the economic governance package . #% It considers that the ECU 1 billion which is needed to support the workers in the tobacco-growing areas can be found under a number of headings , including , for example , the structural funds , EAGGF Guidance , budget lines B1 5010 to B1 5012 and a number of budget lines in Chapter B5 32 designed to stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises . #% We look at political priorities and then decide what should be allocated to them . #% From the answers we have received in the committee it looks as if some customs officers met , put the whole thing together and made it a policy for the Community at that level . #% Some Member States were able to find other solutions to prop up their economies artificially : through asset-price inflation , in part , caused by an unsuitably low interest rate and a refusal to take corrective action by other means ; or by injecting borrowed public funds on an unsustainable scale and , in some cases , to cover up the size of the resulting fiscal deficit . #% So , when we strive for freedom in Vietnam , we are striving to secure our own freedoms and those of other people around the world . #% I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg ! #% The fact is that the result stands and should be recorded in the Minutes . #% Secondly , it is glaringly clear that if the level of control exposed by this case continues , important texts like this one will be worth less than the paper they are printed on . #% Drug-taking is wrong , but we need to help those who are willing to accept help . #% A bale of hay costs five times as much in the Western Isles as it does just outside the nearest city of Inverness . #% Madam President , I welcome the Commission 's communication , ` Europe and Asia : A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships ' , and Mr Maaten 's report , for which we congratulate him . #% These amendments provide welcome recognition that women play a vital role in producing food as well as providing it for their dependants . #% The last decades of the twentieth century have been punctuated by a series of food scares . #% That is why we made compromises and I feel at the moment that we have a balanced report we can all support . #% We now witness the bloody storming of the Red Mosque , where armed Islamists were holed up with women and children . #% They were given no help . #% In so doing I must point out a few home truths to this House , even though I know these will be unpopular with the institution , which prefers to live in its own world , totally detached from reality . #% This episode is a perfect illustration of the cavalier way in which this Parliament too often goes about its business , and that is no laughing matter given the profound effect the EU has on people 's daily lives . #% For all those that know the work of Tony Hatch , they would be very proud of the fact that this was read out here today . #% The time has come for all EU Member States to display realism , generosity and vision , and less of the petty short-sighted protectionism we saw on Monday . #% Enlargement is in all our interests because it will dramatically increase the single market . #% Meeting in public when the Council acts in its legislative capacity is one of them . #% Over 70 million sharks are taken each year and we really need to reduce the number . #% Then we would have real democracy in the Council . #% They include Hussain Osman , one of the 2005 London bombers . #% We also need explanation , more particularly , on foreign policy so that we know what the projections are and how the Council thinks expenditure might be implemented over the next five years . #% As far as time is concerned , while we are in Strasbourg we should use it to full effect , otherwise it just influences the other part-sessions where we then have to do things that we would not otherwise do . #% Bear one thing in mind : it is a Treaty obligation , and since the job summit all the Prime Ministers and the Presidents of the 15 Member States have signed a personal commitment to advance equal opportunities and to provide specific activities to deal with this . #% This resolution contains a rather unnecessary attack on vertical organisation and my group , and I hope Parliament , will reject that element . #% We also need some changes to the first line of Annex 2 , which I am sure the sessional services will take care of if the compromise amendment goes through , substituting ' 50 ' for the global warming potential and putting type-approval in . #% I should also like to welcome the Council and its representatives , who have been somewhat confused at some points in our procedure , which has led to misunderstandings that we hope will be clarified before we come to the final vote . #% Can we be assured that even when the treaties are signed there will be no winding down of DG Enlargement ? #% I am not a member of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , but I particularly want to commend Mr Cappato and colleagues here tonight for their courageous stand in amending the Commission 's original proposal . #% If so , then my next question is why is she here and is she planning to go ? #% You will find that , certainly in the committee , when the two Groups called for a separate vote in order to keep the amendments on the plenary agenda , they did not vote against a single one . #% It is the interests of all of us that he delivers what he says he will . #% Its failure to recognise Cyprus or implement the Ankara protocols , as well as stalling in the ratification of the treaty to re-establish relations with Armenia , is a disappointment . #% Facial covering has become mandatory in many parts of the country ; the movement of women is heavily restricted . #% 
This debate on that report comes at a very opportune moment after American research companies announced that they had successfully cloned human embryos . #% So , the kinds of impacts we are talking about here are indeed very serious . #% We are all conscious of the present developments regarding Iraq . #% Where are our concerns about ` occupied ' Cuba in Guantanamo Bay , where reports indicate that the situation is far worse than Cuba 's worst jails ? #% In our joint resolution we are asking the Commission and the Council to investigate the possibility of the European Union being part of that programme . #% It is good that we are broadening out the discussion , but too few people are engaged . #% Mr President , my assistant , Vikki Phillips , has just handed me a note which says that Denmark spends 15 times more than Greece in carrying out environmental inspections and making appropriate assessments . #% We will also be opening a network of IT learning centres , or ` e-libr@ries' , right across the country . #% What will he be doing between now and November to answer the questions , so that we can be assured his report is full and fair ? #% The reason why they do not want this on the floor today is because they voted against the amendments to help the disabled in the design of buses and coaches . #% The Committee of the Regions asked for 63 % and was knocked down to 54 % . #% However , its task would be made much easier if Member States adopted a more determined and coherent approach to making free movement a reality rather than an ideal that they keep banging on about , but seem incapable of delivering . #% If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control , the ex ante system can be used . #% Mr President , I congratulate all four rapporteurs , who have worked long and hard on their dossiers . #% It is a complicated reply , and therefore difficult to take on board . #% I do not wish to say much more as a supplementary except that we , in Cornwall - in the south-west of the United Kingdom - which I represent , have been very thankful for the support that some of the Commission and Council of Europe programmes have given to upholding our Celtic cultural identity . #% I trust that this first document will be just one step along the way towards bringing us together and helping us to tackle human rights . #% In the same way , we have no quarrel with the Afghan people . #% I welcome what the Commissioner has just said , but does he agree that it should apply not just to the transport of animals that fall to some degree under the existing directive but to the protection of all animals that pass through such livestock markets ? #% We have action plans and conventions but what we want is action , not good intentions . #% Without going into details , I have a letter here from Mr Prodi to one of my colleagues . #% On the whole , with regard to SMEs - particularly in the light of reforms to the definition of retail which embrace a lot of SME lending - we are working towards a framework which is a fair and balanced solution on the SME lending issue . #% In Mr Rothley 's proposals , they will be able to do that simply and easily . #% I urge the House to give a very clear signal , a very positive signal , to vote `` yes '' to this amendment and for this vote to be clear and unambiguous . #% They do not necessarily have the negotiating power of larger companies and therefore provision is made for them . #% In fact , its activities often lead to poverty in the Third World , which is why my party wishes to put this aid back in the hands of Member States alone . #% Could we use your good offices to ensure that we encourage the Commission to take the steps needed to avoid any unnecessary delays ? #% The whole of our committee , in particular on its visit to the United Kingdom , was moved by the plight of the CJD victims and their families which was eloquently expressed to us by Mr and Mrs Churchill . #% I am concerned about the potential for profiling people as potential terrorists on the basis of their race , religion or political opinions . #% In its consideration of these proposals by the Legal Affairs Committee , a very wide-ranging rewording of the text has been carried out which I understand is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and which also meets the concerns of the committee . #% It means , as we say in the resolution , new impetus for the UN consultations on combating illicit brokering . #% This nuclear incident and its sad after-effects for certain individuals have wider implications for the health and safety of all our citizens . #% Therefore I recommend a period of silence : stop talking about an agenda that , year after year , has been universally acknowledged as a failure . #% Favouring some countries in Central Asia over others risks creating a discord and division in the region . #% Can we just check the identity of that card right now and then your investigations can be completed ? #% In the current climate it is important to talk about potential successes as well as problems . #% In Europe the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia has paid an immensely important role in bringing justice to a region torn apart by a series of savage wars . #% It seems to me that the EU and some national governments are guilty of creating a massive public scare that has severely damaged the poultry industry , with little or no justification . #% I think many of us are still wondering , really , what it was that we ever thought we would achieve by going in . #% You can expect us to be constant in the process which is now opening out ahead of us to the end of the year . #% Our thoughts continue to be with their family , and we praise the ongoing efforts of the UK Foreign Office , who are using all possible connections in East Africa to negotiate the pair 's speedy release . #% None of you exactly welcomed Prime Minister Blair last December , at the end of what you all considered to have been a rotten United Kingdom Presidency . #% I tried to press the green button to vote ` Yes ' but it did not register . #% At the very moment when we should be concentrating on meeting the terrorist threat and on possible conflict with Iraq , the defence annexes to the Presidency Conclusions are Ruritanian in their complexity and in their irrelevance . #% It is a shame that 57 % of them experienced financial hardship as a result of their particular Erasmus course . #% I will make it perfectly clear : if it is proved that what I have said is wrong , if it is proved that my research is flawed , then of course , in those circumstances , I would withdraw the remarks and apologise wholeheartedly . #% Mr President , I am grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his work . #% Ah yes , EU citizens , those poor folk who had citizenship forced upon them , from which there is as yet no escape ! #% Mr President , before you take the final vote , Amendment No 3 to paragraph 28 is on the voting list as by the TDI Group . #% The single most important factor is the common currency . #% The defendants have not had an opportunity to challenge the evidence in open court and now the higher tribunal to which the case has been referred is to be held in secret . #% This demands political will and action for the common good so I hope the Commission will today indicate that it sees this as a start , not a conclusion , and that it will also urge action from Member States . #% I am encouraged by the Council 's signal that it will also consider arrangements to put in place such a register and urge them to do so without delay . #% I would like to express my thanks to the many here , including the President , who expressed their concerns for our safety and well-being and particularly to my fellow MEPs , including Mr Belder , Mrs Peijs , my two vice-chairman , the other MEPs , the Parliament staff , Council and Commission staff interpreters and particularly the Commission staff in Washington . #% I do not think his henchman would last very long if he did not reply to the first letter ! #% However they are a welcome contribution to the overall plan of action . #% There seems to be a view that anyone can look after little children , while that is actually not the case . #% I am struck , in particular , by how strongly the theme of genuine partnership shines through ; how the EU/ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique relationship in modern political life and - imperfect as it is - it can stand as a model for new and innovative relations between North and South , which are perhaps today needed more urgently than ever before to build a more peaceful and sustainable world . #% An important part of the budget we have to consider later in the year is putting money into the promotion of beef-eating , to take it out of intervention . #% The summary he has given us certainly indicates the amount of work that has been done on that . #% At a time of regional crisis and an international economic downturn , this will not be easy . #% Measures should be the same throughout the EU to ensure no one Member State gets an unfair advantage . #% I hope that , with proper research into prevention , that figure will be reduced . #% In the UK , all political parties , including a government in office , pledged the British people that they would be consulted on the future of Europe . #% After all , it is not just North Korea that is outside the remit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty ; we have Pakistan , India and Israel , all of which have nuclear weapons . #% There is no European Union-wide agency looking at this although , in the USA , there is the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta . #% 
I believe you would now find a much more positive response to a proposal for a directive than perhaps was the case with the previous administration . #% The agreement will allow patients to be reimbursed for treatment they receive , up to the amount anticipated by their own national health system for similar treatment . #% We hope the humanitarian efforts will continue and if it is necessary in the coming days to take further measures , as enjoined by the resolution we are about to adopt , then I believe the House here and the people of Europe should stand behind those forces , as I do , whether they are American , British or others , if the time comes - and the time is coming - when we must finish the job we began in 1991 . #% We must continue to tackle the big three of AIDS , TB and malaria , but just as many -- or even more -- people die , become chronically ill or live with disabilities caused by diseases that the world neglects . #% He was being helped to help himself come out of that deep black hole of addiction . #% These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised . #% The Commission must also look at the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments . #% Mr President , this resolution states that we are appalled by the atrocities in East Timor and that these awful events strengthen the need for effective controls on arms exports . #% We have the opportunity to tell our people that we do care about the big issues that they care about , that we can help deliver a better peace , security , prosperity , environment and quality of life - issues that can genuinely be helped best at a European level . #% It is not only women to whom this happens . #% Even if they happen to be conscious when they are taken away and protest that they are entitled to equivalent free healthcare , they are nonetheless whisked off to a private hospital . #% Attack the cause , not the system . #% Here in France , three of his children were able to go to university , something that was impossible to imagine in Ghana . #% The compromise we have agreed and voted in the environment committee has resolved many points of difference between various colleagues in the Parliament , but not all of them , as we know . #% The Committee on the Environment has put together three reports , we call them ` insight reports ' , basing ourselves on the model of the US Congress . #% The key to this process is in the title : driving innovation . #% But where you have a system of quotas and where you have a system of subsidies , you need to be able to put a brake on production . #% They were unable to make a living wage and therefore unable to send their children to school or to have any access to medical care . #% Today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation . #% Furthermore , if both communities do not give their free consent and the arrangements break down in the future , blame will be apportioned to the players who leaned on the Cypriot people to get a ` yes ' vote . #% Maybe the rapporteur could explain the amendment later on , but I fear that it seeks to water down the commitment contained in the Commission 's proposal to ensure that high-quality voyage data recorders - black boxes - are fitted in all ships , old and new , by 2007 . #% Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States . #% It is vital that , now we have created the Natura 2000 network , we are prepared to find the money to continue to finance it where necessary . #% This is not just an abstract piece of work . #% Yes , I support exemptions for small operators , but I can see how some countries that want to subsidise production in certain remote areas would use that definition . #% Although it is rare , I have to say that I have some sympathy with our colleagues from the right of the House when they say that four reports on better law-making is a bit of a blockbuster , is it not ? #% I regard this entire law-making exercise as a failure . #% We have amendments about consumer protection - so important in the establishment of trust in e-commerce - on the future of taxation , on the implications for healthcare and for transport . #% An IGC with a more democratic flavour and less diplomatic style will be more successful and much quicker in reaching a conclusion . #% The first question will be whether it is a food and drug agency or a food safety agency that you are proposing ? #% So far as it is feasible we want to be able to offer them some sort of certainty at these moments of personal crisis . #% As the minister pointed out , direct trade and helping the economy of the north would assist in a political settlement . #% I hope that , together , we can really make the internal market work as quickly as possible . #% Finally , as regards biofuels on set-aside land , I know the Commissioner has changed his views on that . #% It is a response to the Commission 's communication on recent changes to the International Atomic Energy Agency 's transport regulations . #% However , the Legal Affairs Committee felt , taking everything into account , that it was right in these two cases to maintain Mr Bossi 's immunity . #% However , that freedom is limited and some would say contradicted by other specific laws . #% The UK Conservative response will not be limp . #% Mr President , it is a very interesting innovation that this debate be rounded up with a contribution from the rapporteur , and why not ! #% Whatever the outcome of the accession negotiations , it is only through the process of the accession negotiations that the European-Turkey relationship will develop . #% That change started in the 1980s , when changing conditions demanded computer-generated production processes and the longer-term efficiencies that they produce . #% We already have a European arrest warrant . #% He met leaders of NGOs , journalists and ordinary people in Togo . #% We would point out that such a view flies in the face of the Commission 's own quality shipping initiative , which says : ` exposure of the sub-standard players to public knowledge is essential to the objective of the quality shipping initiative . ' #% A transition period is built into the proposal to give time for re-equipment . #% Can I request that we have some other time to ask the Commissioner questions ? #% I lay that failure directly at the door of the British Government , and Tony Blair in particular . #% I would agree , for once , with Mr Tannock , certainly on the question of the lack of post-war planning . #% Regarding the previous debate , I would also like to ask Commissioner Diamantopoulou to use all available means to keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe . #% However , for what it is worth , I would just say the following . #% So Slovenia has got a real problem . #% This , however , has been a variant on the kind of health concerns and maladies with which we are only too familiar , and on behalf of my group I want to thank Ms Evans very warmly for the skilful way in which she has negotiated the process of codecision . #% Matters are not helped by the current boycott of parliamentary dialogue by the Awami League opposition . #% It still only works when you have skilled rapporteurs who can go through these shoals . #% The committee felt very strongly about that . #% I would just like to follow up the response from the President-in-Office of the Council to this question by mentioning the Luxembourg Compromise which we do not hear much of now . #% However , we are still legislating in the dark when it comes to nutrient profiling , and that is not a good way of legislating . #% The document includes a timetable for the completion of the current negotiations . #% My group will vote in favour of this tomorrow . #% Solitary confinement must be the exception and not the norm . #% Most recently , it has starved many of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies . #% If we had , we would have been very reluctant to see these proposals adopted at all . #% What some colleagues want to do , is to shut that down . #% That is the sort of practical definition and clarification of the process that we need . #% All this has led to the interest in organic farming as a means of ensuring that completely wholesome food is being produced . #% So I welcome this change to the Rules of Procedure . #% 
Macro-economic progress has yet to trickle down into tangible economic benefits for the population at large . #% I should like you to ask the Bureau and the presidency to give us in this House , as soon as possible , a comparison of the proposed personnel reforms in this parliamentary institution with the reforms proposed in the Commission . #% We need Russia 's help as part of the Quartet to work towards a peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict with a new PM of Israel and US President in place . #% The best way we can do that without going to conciliation is to vote it as a legislative resolution , binding therefore only on Parliament . #% However , under the Rules , it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment . #% This will also be at a reasonable cost , which must not be overlooked . #% You can not promote homosexuality in Africa . #% If you read paragraph 9 carefully , Mrs Dührkop has there accepted the challenge that it means looking at those policies which should be continued and even reinforced , but also at those which should no longer be thus considered . #% Thus our message should be to encourage Romania to intensify its efforts , not to try to pull the rug from underneath its feet at this crucial moment . #% Canon Andrew White , who ran Iraq 's only Anglican Church , left Baghdad yesterday amid fears for his life and safety after trying to secure the release of five kidnapped Britons . #% Madam President , firstly I wish to tell Mr Monti that I will not be engaging in any personal attacks on him - he has an extremely difficult job . #% That surprises me , because it seems to me that you are indulging in masochism . #% Overcoming that divide , to my mind , should be one of the key points that we emphasise in this report . #% As the last speaker I have two points to make and one question for the Commissioner this evening . #% In the area of access to justice we need mutual recognition to be accompanied by common minimum standards and it would have been good to see something about the rights of people to get bail when they are criminal defendants in a state other than their own . #% The main lesson that I would draw - which is not embodied in the Convention text - is that we need to be much more careful that we adopt legislation that is put into force . #% The law of unintended political consequences already says that the effect of REACH will be to export jobs . #% As far as European operators are concerned , I would like to say very clearly that the regulation as we have amended it should do nothing but benefit responsible European operators , since the vast majority of them already do most of what is being asked , and the existence of the regulation will prevent them from being undercut by other , less scrupulous , operators . #% The self-employed are included as a matter of principle and can only be excluded if two things happen : first , if the Commission proposes such an exclusion ; and secondly , if we , as co-legislator here in Parliament , agree with such an exclusion . #% The Scottish MEPs are most grateful to the Commissioner for meeting us and for his assurances that these proposals are not yet firm ones . #% If the Commission can not carry out its role as Guardian of the Treaties , this is really very serious and the whole legal framework of the Union can accordingly be brought into disrepute and called into question . #% Throughout this Parliament we have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement its programmes such as mine action urgently , in times of crisis or when lives are at stake . #% We believe the priorities of the European Council must be to agree a limited number of specific measures , so that eurozone members can help each other through the immediate crisis without imposing any burdens on Member States who have chosen to remain outside , and then to reassert the vital importance of dealing with the long-term crisis which we face : the risk of a permanent collapse in our economic competiveness . #% It is clear that the Council is going to continue with this agreement in its original form , just changing the legal basis but still ignoring Parliament in the process . #% Search as I may through the Rules of Procedure , I can find no rule allowing the President to act in such an arbitrary manner and no rule is quoted in his letter . #% As the resolution says , we must continue to highlight minority rights , and , as we did this morning , we should vote so as to support the ideas in the Howitt report . #% It has been very clear in recent years that NGOs have played an important role in the development of environment policy and on many occasions have raised awareness of environmental problems amongst the general public and decision-makers to the point where legislative action has been taken to cure those problems . #% We merely stand back and take the criticism . #% I hope the Commission position will reflect that consultation , both of this Parliament , the ACP Group and of course the NGOs you have had discussions with . #% They showed that the democratic opposition parties have been afforded greater freedom and fairer treatment . #% This is really one of the most significant aspects of the scheme . #% That is the strongest signal we can send to our citizens that this process is for them and not merely for the capital markets . #% This is lunacy ! #% I could give you many more similar quotations . #% The rapporteur even had to fight to get a separate debate on education on our agenda this morning . #% Those amendments seeking , for example , to ban or restrict the use of embryonic stem cells totally are doing the European public no favours . #% Secondly , the Commission rightly analysed the problems and successes of the previous directive , and I want to remark here that this was the first directive where the agreement of the committee coordinators to invite the Commission to present its full impact assessment of any proposal was carried out to the full . #% If we do not do this , perhaps the Commissioner could explain how we can possibly evaluate the success of our policies and how disabled , unemployed people can be helped back into work . #% I thank the rapporteur , Mrs Rothe , very much indeed for all the work she has put in to get this agreement . #% They are simply to restrict Saddam Hussein ' s ability to kill and terrorise his own people . #% I respect the sincerity of Mr Cushnahan in particular , although I regret that he has chosen to make a personal attack on the British Prime Minister this afternoon . #% The issue is not just about the method -- whether it is abduction or immigration problems -- but also the outcome . #% It is naive to place hopes in a database covering the whole of the EU , with all its different languages and IT systems , when the failed attempt to produce a Health Service database for the UK alone has wasted billions of pounds . #% We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity . #% The more we can do to help women and parliaments to develop , the better . #% Finally , we are very concerned about the future of the A-30 lines , or rather how they are going to be spent . #% I hope it will not reoccur . #% So a total of 65 million workers in the EU are in the small and medium sector , which shows that it is very important for us to be discussing the growth of such a sector . #% Although politically , expenses and remuneration are two sides of the same coin , their legal bases are distinct . #% It is vital , as I have said , that we do not rush to make a judgement . #% And lastly , how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures ? #% What we want is a renewal of the sanctions against Zimbabwe , which are up for renewal by the EU on 20 February 2004 . #% We have to do better to serve our whole population with just and inclusive policies . #% That is the reason why , even now , today , with bombs and rockets , with the difficulties of security , the majority of Iraqis prefer to be without the previous regime and in the situation they are in now . #% The health of future generations , certainly in the northern hemisphere , is very much threatened by this smuggling and continued use of CFCs . #% It was not Mr Pimenta 's intention in drafting this , or that of the Environment Committee , to bind the Commission 's negotiating hands in Kyoto . #% The agency is doing a good and essential job . #% It is essential for adequate defence budgets to be combined with courageous steps towards coordination and greater rationalisation of defence procurement . #% It is very difficult to find a subject which does not fall under those three but , in the light of the way in which this has been prepared , we in this House and our committees will find the right way in debates to put forward where we think the priorities lie . #% These last three years have shown the creaking structure of the financial perspective . #% The outcome must arise from objective assessment by the appropriate authority of each individual situation and is not therefore automatic for persons of either gender . #% If we in Europe want to deny poor nations the right to sell harvested ivory legitimately and sustainably , should we not be contributing financially to meet our desires and their needs ? #% The final point I would like to make is that we must reinforce the environmental possibilities of biotechnology . #% To show in this debate that the High Representative does answer questions , can I ask her three in particular ? #% The security interests of the West should be represented in space not by an illegitimate European Union but with our ally the USA , in partnership with the only legitimate security organisation that has the democratic backing of the people of Europe , NATO . #% There are other amendments to this report also worthy of consideration . #% 
One of the background arguments that we have heard in this debate concerns issues of parity between the treatment of nationals and third-country nationals . #% That is the case that the UK PSE delegation is making , particularly with regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on reducing the excise duty below that set out in the original report . #% It is colonialism at its most vicious , and I accuse these institutions of racism and exploitation of vulnerable societies . #% That was a very kind gesture from the Italian presidency . #% The only certain aspect seems to be the consistent prediction that fusion will come good as a major source of renewable energy in 50 years time . #% Firstly , it is clear that in many areas of defence equipment procurement there are very complex contractual arrangements , in many cases also involving a significant amount of product development . #% I wish to commend to you and to the House the Pery report and to call upon the House to give it its wholehearted support and consent . #% We have a sensible and balanced position and I fear Amendment No 11 may tilt that balance in the wrong direction . #% Countries with the highest undeclared work may well be recording the highest official unemployment figures , thereby attracting the highest offsetting regional funds . #% I have been very grateful for that cooperation with both the Council and the Commission and , of course , for the very supportive cooperation of colleagues within the committee . #% It is in all our interests that Ukraine should be helped in its consolidation as an independent , democratic country anchored in the west but with an open , vibrant and friendly relationship with Russia to its east . #% Which organisation have you ever come across which has had no dissent from its members ? #% At present , there are thousands -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- of alerts of suspicious transactions every year across the EU . #% No wonder the Norwegians said no ! #% We therefore welcome the statement in the report that space research is one of the priority themes for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and development . #% The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter . #% Some people do not consider that to be a human right , but I believe in fact that it is and represents another step forward that we should welcome . #% On the other institutions , we have had useful discussions in the last day or two . #% You need tough action , and I hope that will be forthcoming in the next few months . #% We will not install barriers but we can not guarantee that existing cultural or legal inhibitions can automatically be dismantled . #% The report is so flawed that it can not be supported . #% In the David Goliath contest , the French people have aimed their stone well and they killed the Constitution . #% I doubt whether all the people who voted for paragraph 35 could have read it , because it restricts the right of residence , accommodation and education . #% We should have turned to specific battery collection long ago . #% I have nothing against ferrets , but I would think that even a small risk that rabies may be spread by even such an exotic source as this needs us to give further pause for thought and consideration , rather than simply rushing ahead with a proposal about which at least one Member State still has serious reservations . #% I , like many others , look forward to reading and evaluating the results of this programme and hope that they will make real progress in tackling social exclusion . #% We need a Banking Committee in the European Parliament that deals with financial services and which will deal with the European Central Bank in the same way that nations like the United States of America have a powerful Banking Committee . #% However , education is not within EU competence ! #% The Council seems to be poised to throttle the broad remit sought by the Commission in the field of public health and would doubtless follow that by a noose of budgetary restrictions . #% This time , when you look at the political agreement they have arrived at - which looks astonishingly like a common position already - we will possibly find it harder to change it . #% As no agreement was possible with the Commission , the committee has had to reiterate its position , so we are dealing here not with a new report , where Rule 52 ( 3 ) may be applied again , but with the confirmation of the first report . #% This was , of course , nonsense , and there are many examples of this nonsense . #% Mr President , I am reluctant to take the floor but it is in response to something you said ... #% For a moment I thought that this was some new ingredient that was being demonstrated in the detergents which had been used to clean the Chamber overnight . #% I have learnt from meetings with numerous industry representatives and other stakeholders that many countries , and also many companies , already have in place excellent systems which would fulfil most , if not all , requirements of the due-diligence system . #% On the wider definition , we must examine our prejudice and our firmly held beliefs . #% We believe that Parliament is there to safeguard citizens and make certain that the asylum policy is carried out in the fairest possible way . #% We hear talk about the Sunni , the Shia and the Kurds , but who has been talking about the 800 000 Assyrians that live in Iraq ? #% They would be to blame if that were to occur , and I hope we can work together to make sure that we put this piece of the jigsaw puzzle in place as soon as possible . #% Mrs Gradin has obviously always taken her duty of discretion provided for in the Treaty seriously as a responsible and reputable person . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner , not just for coming here today to listen to the debate , but also for the help I believe he gave to Members of Parliament in Geneva last week . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate my colleague Mr Ceyhun for approaching a very difficult and sensitive issue . #% All we have is the statement that the position has changed , not the reason for it . #% The Commission have recognized in the Annual Economic Report the fact that during this period of consolidation we have seen a very serious fall in the level of investment , and in particular public investment , within the European Union and the Commission themselves recommend that Member States must be very cautious that during the period of consolidation not to completely undermine public investment . #% It is clear that this proposal was designed with continental ports in mind , with the desire to liberalise the port services market , which is , for the most part , still nationalised . #% As the final speaker from the floor this year , may I wish all the staff , all the Members and all the people of Europe a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year . #% But we should not only be adopting the positive amendments , we really should be deleting some of the original paragraphs entirely . #% Please do not suppress it or let it disappear . #% I think it could go further , but I am delighted that the two are linked together , which was a key demand from this side of the House . #% The second barrier concerns the fear in Member States of ceding power to the European Commission . #% That text circulated throughout the anti-fascist resistance movements during the last years of the war and was one of the main motivations , the main ideals , that helped spread the European message at that time , well ahead of the European movements convention in The Hague . #% We are launching this single currency on 1 January 1999 , the coins and notes will be in circulation in 2002 . #% The first concerns Mike and Ann Radford , two constituents of mine from Chipping Barnet , who bought a property in Cyprus in the 1980s and for 14 years have been trying to get redress from their builder for a faulty retaining wall . #% I really enjoyed working with the Commission and all the people that have helped me . #% Does the Council believe that the Commission could be encouraged to use the legal instruments already available to it , in particular in the field of competition rules , for example , and rules governing the internal market ? #% If we ever get to the stage of a European contract code , then we can not risk that it suffers the same fate as the proposed Constitution last year . #% I hope that the Commissioner will say what more is to be done to give added urgency to what is such a very important programme . #% Punishment should be meted out by criminal sanctions not civil liability . #% The report makes clear something that we all know : that the vast majority of single parents are women . #% We must not think of rural areas as the playground of visitors from the towns . #% Does the Commissioner agree that it is important that we should put all possible pressure on at the present time because after the American presidential election this may be looked at in quite a different light ? #% As to the amendments which have been proposed , we agreed last week not to support any amendments , and I say this mainly for colleagues like Mr Brinkhorst . #% I hope that split vote will go through so that we can support the resolution as a whole . #% The UK delegation therefore requested separate votes on these paragraphs and voted against them . #% However , two things need to be said about SAB4 . #% Whilst I firmly believe that Parliament can achieve most of what it wants within the body of this proposal , there clearly remain a number of issues on which we must all exercise good judgment and flexibility . #% 
Patents are an important plank of legal rights to encourage inventions . #% However , it had to be endured to secure any future at all . #% British Conservatives voted in favour of the resolution on Afghanistan , which contains many useful elements , but we do not accept the implied criticism of US actions in Recital I , and in the new paragraph 15a ; the desire for the EU as such to create a political role for itself ; the suggestion in paragraph 15 that the Council should reconsider its proposals for return of refugees ; or indeed the proposal in the new paragraph 10a that ISAF military forces should be employed to investigate human rights abuses , notwithstanding our earnest desire for improvement in the human rights situation , particularly in relation to the situation of women . #% Article VI , Title 2 of the new Treaty clearly states that environmental considerations should be integrated into all areas of European Union policy and practice and we believe that includes macroeconomic dialogue . #% My message to the ACP is that we still wish on principle that ACP delegates should only be from among members of parliament and not ambassadors , and preferably from government and opposition parties , which would better reflect the balance of the European Parliament 's delegation . #% It has been my privilege to handle it on behalf of Parliament and I commend it to this House for support tomorrow . #% This is reflected in the annexes . #% A third priority which I particularly welcome is that which we attach to the problems related to the introduction of the euro and the impact of the millennium bug . #% When this argument gets out there amongst the peoples of Europe , it will be a potentially explosive issue , because once again we have the political class here in the institutions of Brussels and Strasbourg heading in one direction , and public opinion demanding that you head in completely the opposite direction . #% Its economy is heavily dependent on fishing , however , having had a disastrous venture into financial services , and Iceland is therefore likely to demand a significant concession to protect its fishing industries if it ever joins the EU . #% Long hours and difficult working conditions are extremely dangerous and can be harmful to the health and productivity of our young people . #% In a roll-call vote on the crucial paragraphs the amendment from Mr FabreAubrespy was defeated by the votes of 365 Members , an absolute majority of this House , and paragraph 10 had 364 Members , an absolute majority of the Members of this House , voting in favour . #% I hope that at Cancún , although Commissioner Lamy denies that it is a central issue , we will realise that for developing countries it certainly is . #% After all , on the original timetable nobody had originally thought we would finish before Christmas , so there is nothing to panic about . #% We have kept our promises . #% Terrorism is the curse of our age . #% The Labour Government is at the forefront of providing jobs for our young people and also measures to protect them at work . #% They want to see good , regulated , affordable , universal postal services which can be guaranteed with good quality-of-service regulations . #% I would also like to welcome the PPE-DE Group 's proposal for an oral question to the Commission for the November Strasbourg part-session about the appalling information flow in Eurostat , the problems involving whistleblowers , the audits that lay untouched in Eurostat and the lack of political responsibility in the Commission . #% The details contained in the report , as has already been said , are the result of extensive consultation with all the key interest bodies . #% I also learnt from you that you were intending that industry should undertake these studies . #% I understand , from the rapporteur , that she may well be prepared to leave the decision to the wisdom of the House . #% I very much hope that we can achieve our goals , so that , our citizens will benefit from a dynamic and competitive economy . #% The treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union , in our continent and in the world . #% Indeed , if ever there was a case for European co-operation , the research programme makes it strongly . #% When I received the English version I found that pages 17 to 24 are published in Finnish to make it comprehensible to the Commissioner but incomprehensible to anybody else . #% If MEPs complied with their own words , then perhaps the public would listen . #% It is not just that our budgetary priorities are wrong , the system is also wrong . #% However , the ECR has consistently been against setting quotas for women within national , regional and international institutions , as well as the establishment of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) . #% This product has been shut out of the market for over 14 years , and the Commissioner 's account of why this has been was very different from that of the Chair of the Committee on Petitions who opened the debate . #% The committee started from an a priori belief that the USA and the CIA are guilty , and merely sought with little success to substantiate its prejudices . #% The most recent 1994 Eurobarometer survey on the perception of poverty and social exclusion in Europe indicates that most Europeans believe that the levels of poverty and social exclusion have increased in the last ten years and that the gap between rich and poor is growing . #% We need to ask Parliament 's Central Asian Delegation to put these on our agenda for the PCA discussions we shall shortly be having with the representatives of Kazakhstan , and then report back to Parliament . #% As the parent of a diabetic daughter , can I support the honourable Member in her plea for Commission action and particularly congratulate her on the initiative that she and Mr Bovis are taking to bring this to the attention of Parliament . #% Countries like the United Kingdom for example after all those disastrous years of under-investment under Tory governments , need to catch up and we must be able to let them do that . #% And that , unfortunately , is the grim reality of compulsory full pay maternity leave in this report . #% Neglect of European Union environment law forms an alarming background to this proposal . #% We need to detail this clearly in the annexes to ensure that we have a uniform level of risk assessment across the Union . #% I have voted in favour of this report , as it is one of the most important in the area of fisheries to be considered by this Parliament . #% So much for British interests ! #% We have only the three amendments before us that were voted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . #% The regulation will put unnecessary restrictions on producers in particular affecting small and medium sized producers of agricultural products . #% I am reminded that China also continues to stockpile enormous quantities of anti-personnel landmines . #% We know , though , that the law is flouted in too many cases . #% We do not wish guidelines -- which is what financial perspectives are -- to become an end in themselves . #% I am gay . #% The Commission should have done the sensible thing : it should have revised this proposal completely before it brought it forward . #% I applaud the beefing up of the trans-European networks and a good start would be for a fast train between Brussels and Strasbourg to make our lives as MEPs much more bearable . #% It is to be hoped that those inspections will not just pick off small businesses but will actually look at some of the larger enterprises that rely very heavily , at the bottom end , on vulnerable workers . #% In some ways we could compare Mr Bangemann to a thorn amongst roses , although I am quite sure he will take the subject very seriously . #% I would also like to say to colleagues from the mainland continent of Europe that we sincerely hope that we have not exported the disease to mainland Europe . #% In fact , if a farmer has to lose his whole herd for one case of BSE he may be less inclined to declare the animal and may bury it instead . #% Both issues can be solved with imaginative thinking and money . #% It was not the first of its kind , nor , sadly , was it the last maritime disaster of its kind . #% We believe it is an important issue and I concur with my colleague , Mrs De Keyser , who spoke earlier . #% Let us not have another debate like this . #% It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes . #% Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this not only in Britain , but indeed in most of the EU Member States . #% This leads me to a further compromise amendment , which would allow a national authority , if it wanted , to exempt companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR 350 million from the EU requirement , so long as they are not marketing outside that Member State . #% We believe that this report places too much emphasis on protecting EU agricultural markets from outside competition and not enough emphasis on exporting production standards . #% Well , it is not too late . #% What a pity that the DTI and the CBI in the United Kingdom spurned this sensible change in Europe . #% They already deserve our congratulations on their work on the original legislation , Council and Parliament Regulation 1049/2001 , where their work was crucial in securing that positive result . #% Nor can we take any from other countries in Europe . #% SMEs in Europe face much greater difficulties than their US counterparts in raising loan or equity finance , which may help in part to explain the extraordinary success in US economic growth over the last ten years . #% Madam President , may I just say what a pleasure it is to be invited to take the floor at five minutes to midnight . #% 
To meet this demand , or at similar times such as particularly cold days in winter , some of our older coal-fired power stations are pressed into service . #% We need to join together and make serious protests in the future . #% Yesterday I went to the presidency website - it was the first day of the presidency - to see what its priorities were , and there was a sign saying that nothing would be available until 16.30 hours . #% So I hope we will all recognise just how important the role of culture is in our continent and our society and that those of us who have actually turned up for this debate will take the message back to our Member States , to the regions and to the people we represent . #% We approve of using appropriations in a more efficient way , of demanding more clarity in the breakdown of each submitted budget proposal , and in stating that it costs more than $ 200 million per year to site the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg . #% We have heard conflicting rumours . #% We therefore proposed that measures should be introduced to allow flexibility in application of the so-called HACCP system to regional slaughterhouses which are in peripheral or remote regions . #% Mr President , we are to have an extended period of reflection , are we ? #% Also , on some routes , fares increased while others were so cheap that airlines went bust or built up huge losses . #% We are just not convinced that the case has been made for this specific proposal and that it will actually help artists . #% They are internationalists . #% Documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine , it was business as usual . #% Then it went on to anticipate what he might say to Mr Chirac the next time they meet : ` Jacques , the proud upholder of the most immoral state-subsidised policy in human history -- the GBP 27 billion-a-year common agricultural policy ' , which transfers British taxpayers ' money to ` bloated French landowners , pumping up food prices in Europe and creating poverty in Africa ' . #% One of the reasons why we are discussing this issue tonight is because there is an international conference in Paris at the end of this month , a key opportunity to make progress on the subject of innovative sources of finance for development . #% Mr President , I was in Washington last week leading the European Parliament delegation responsible for our relations with the United States Congress and we started our pre-Commission briefing at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday , 11 September 2001 , just after the first plane had hit one of the towers and just before the second . #% Mr President , I too appreciate greatly that the Greek Presidency has taken an enlightened approach to facilitating legal migration and integration , not just fighting illegal immigration . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the report proposes that Member States may issue long-stay visas for up to 12 months for third-country nationals which will be recognised by other states within the Schengen group . #% There are many people in China for whom this agreement does not spell good news . #% The psychological terror that our new alliance has properly caused against terrorism in the region is causing the new flight of so many new millions of refugees . #% Indeed , if public companies now fail to show pension liabilities in their accounts , the director would face prison , yet national government finance ministers flout the rules daily . #% The Commission has always made it clear to Russia that reversing capital flight urgently and fundamentally requires a more appropriate investment environment and better protection of investor rights in Russia . #% I come from a country that already has very high standards of animal welfare and hygiene , which are vigorously policed . #% So the report we have seen debated this evening is Van Buitenen II . #% It can surely be no coincidence that , since the Labour Government ' s brave decision in May 1997 , Britain has enjoyed an unprecedented period of economic stability . #% This is marvellous and I wish it happened with other reports . #% This House has called for effective action by the Council on six separate occasions . #% This is the opportunity we have to seize . #% The message delivered on that occasion might shed some light in our current darkness . #% This could only delay the introduction of the ban , especially if it encouraged the re-examination of whether an export ban is in fact the best way to achieve the EU 's aims . #% They are relative newcomers to our committee and they have shown their grasp of what our committee is about . #% However , this whole House should give out the message loud and clear . #% Mr President , I will draw the honourable Member 's remarks to the attention of my colleague , Mr Fischler , and I know that they will be of interest to him . #% I welcome that , but there are also other precedents it might set which could be less positive , in particular its impact on other countries in the region . #% It is there in the law of the Court of Justice . #% I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here -- the only one which I have time to address . #% The gap between the political classes and the real peoples of Europe is getting wider by the day . #% I have still been unable to establish the fate of my interpreter and driver from Banda Aceh . #% The creation of a separate institute in regard to this issue risks ghettoisation by leaving it open to single-issue pressure groups and thus easier to disregard and marginalise . #% That does not mean that we all retreat into our shells and say that the nationalised railway is the be-all and the end-all . #% The motion itself stands well because it calls on the European Union to work with the Government of India to use the money that is available to make sure that there is a clean-up of those sites , treatment of affected people and compensation to those affected ; and now , not in another 20 years . #% I fear I shall say some of the things that have already been said . #% That is the sort of practical thing the Commission needs to work on . #% They are all known as mobile workers for the purposes of this directive . #% If anything carries the spirit of what Mr Tamino is attempting to do and what we endorse it would be Amendment No 9 as adopted by the Committee on the Environment . #% Mr President , an essential element of effective and engaged citizenship is an understanding of a society 's shared and common heritage . #% If the Commission concludes that they must remain , then they should be properly regulated . #% This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria . #% But that neglects the growing economic and social substance of the European Union , the unique opportunity it offers to channel relevant action on health protection and promotion for its citizens . #% The fact that America , Canada , Russia and many Central Asian countries are also full members gives the organisation great credibility and breadth - ` from Vancouver to Vladivostok ' , as the OSCE itself boasts . #% Quite often , if you are taken on as a live-in employee , you can be seen as being on call 24/7 . #% That is our challenge . #% Clearly it is still early days in terms of judgement on the results of the ECB ' s mandate but here , too , we can already point to many positive signs , not least that investors are prepared to lend euro area governments their money at very low rates of interest . #% You may need more time to do it but you can not just say that it is down to inference . #% Then again , who can blame the City of Strasbourg for trying it on with the European Parliament ? #% The idea that a large family is automatically the route out of poverty must be eradicated and women , all women , must be able to choose whether or not to have children . #% We have many new powers , including , importantly , the right to propose a reform -- a reform in the future of the Constitution itself . #% We had a problem with two Leeds fans being murdered in a UEFA Cup game in Istanbul against Galatasaray , yet no action was taken against Galatasaray - they were not thrown out of the UEFA Cup . #% We need the Commission to explain clearly its position with regard to this subject , and how it will advance the issue of civil liability , not just in this sector , but in other sectors where human health and the environment could be threatened by inappropriate activity . #% As a doctor I know that advances in medicine are often achieved only after rigorous scrutiny and challenge in peer review journals . #% Whilst we support much of what the Hulthén report contains , and of course its objectives , we could not vote in favour of a package that contains references to European eco-taxes . #% Half of them are illiterate and two-thirds of the world 's children , most of them little girls , are not in any kind of primary education . #% In addition , the following paragraphs contain statements which are not supported by the evidence and findings of the lessons to be learned and Royal Society reports : paragraphs 6 , 16 and 25 . #% So in the UK we opted for a complete ban . #% Some Member States operate a card system , others do not . #% That is fair and , although individual carriers ' groups will be upset that there should be any liability at all , if it is spread across all the responsible carriers it will help them all . #% Neo-liberal economics which result in more unemployment and hopelessness will bring in new recruits for fundamentalism and other intolerant creeds and fan the flames of terrorism and violence . #% 
The Commissioner has spent enough time and has had enough trouble dealing with that process . #% I call on colleagues from all political parties and groups to vote this report through unanimously . #% This will happen if we have substantially agreed the main and most contentious trade issues . #% We call on the Council and Member States to ask the United Nations Security Council to urgently address the situation in Burma . #% I agree with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector . #% So there have been some positive moves . #% We can do our best and this directive is a major step forward in achieving that . #% Will we have more action , not just more of the same ? #% We will happily consider , however , any proposal that stable recognised partnerships qualify if home countries recognise or if a country of employment recognises them . #% Being unclear helps no one and I simply do not understand why some in this House do not want the use of the term `` fundamental Islamist organisations '' to describe al-Qa ` ida and their ilk . #% There is a better way . #% She says that the Belgian presidency is expected to put this forward or start a debate . #% We have to be aware of this danger and make sure that it does not happen . #% As you said Commissioner , 1 % a year now seems far too low a target to be aiming for . #% Another problem is the length of reference period . #% We certainly look forward to the report returning to Parliament . #% One of the key issues is that of family reunification . #% I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission is considering opening an office in Podgorica . #% Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects , which are hard to monitor , towards capital schemes where , in the majority of cases , the benefits are there for all to see . #% Madam President , I rise on a point of order that I referred to this House back in September of last year following the tragic death of Diana , Princess of Wales . #% They have analysed the problem , suggested improvements , but sadly little has been achieved . #% We want only minimum changes in the existing system , those which are required to maintain financial equilibrium in the agriculture sector during this interim period . #% I will therefore abstain , with a very heavy heart , on all the final votes . #% For these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote . #% That authority is once again reaffirmed in Mr Laschet 's report and in our vote here this morning . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruitjen talked about notaries . #% I urge the Commissioner never to let this happen again . #% We , in Europe , must do our part and set a good example to the rest of the world , while recognising that the major pressure for energy consumption in future will come from countries like the United States , which is rather profligate in its consumption of energy , and also from developing countries which , as their economies grow and they raise their standard of living , will look for more energy consumption , which is likely to come from rather polluting sources of energy . #% If that were the sort of response a minister in the British Government gave to a member of the British House of Commons , he would deservedly be pilloried in that House . #% Surely it would be better for the United Kingdom to sit at the WTO in its own right . #% It does not inspire confidence that these forces are doing enough to harass him and his network of loyal supporters so that he can be brought to justice . #% Yesterday afternoon , President Borrell denied me the chance to make a one-minute speech to mention this to Parliament . #% If you do that you devalue the work of the scientific committees , introduce an atmosphere of suspicion and end up with an unsatisfactory proposal . #% Secondly , how will the communication ensure that together we better meet the UN goals on development , for example , halving world poverty by 2015 . #% We wish the Commission well in this work . #% If that is so , then I condemn it . #% Mr President , I would firstly like to acknowledge the work that the Court of Auditors did in producing the report that my report is based on which contained lots of detailed work . #% Firstly , as a matter of principle , we have the institutional agreement of 1993 , which says that the programme should be presented by October , and then our agreement of 2000 , under which we are to have a broad debate about the programme before it is implemented . #% While making great demands of the candidate countries , it is a pity that the European Union has not already put its own house in order . #% The rapporteur has referred to the need for this and I commend her on her work . #% Mr President , communication is a two-way process . #% As has already been pointed out both by the rapporteur herself and by Mr Martin , this is a consumer protection issue , an area in which we should all be concerned to protect the interests of our constituents and citizens . #% We have to very carefully consider how we deal with these substances . #% Mr President , as colleagues realise , this resolution largely deals with the results of the very happy election in Palestine on 9 January when 28 colleagues observed the elections , chaired by myself and with Mrs Napoletano as deputy chairman . #% I hope this amendment can be adopted tomorrow and we get a clear reference to this in the directive for the future . #% That should be happening around about now , if it was going to . #% What else we are up to , I am not quite sure . #% That is why our initiative to end this scourge of late payments is absolutely right . #% · the report ( with the exception of the explanatory statement ) makes no mention of the need for good governance or of the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse ; #% Even though the UK will get its rebate , and quite rightly so , those lines will not contribute towards that . #% It is a country with which we trade profitably and a country we wish to encourage . #% But the horrific death of Graham Staines and his two sons , in January , sadly brought to public attention a worsening persecution . #% What would follow from that would inevitably be that the different party groups , and then the different political party structures in Europe generally , would then have to come up with candidates before the European elections . #% With enlargement around the corner , some consideration must be given as to how this directive will affect the newcomers ' individual labour markets . #% Over the last years as a parliamentarian , I have had the privilege , on behalf of this House , to attend many of The Hague meetings , to get to know the people behind this apparently rather technical and distant exercise , to see the officials and national experts at their work , drafting and negotiating very complex and technical agreements to assist our citizens . #% The sports boycott has been flouted due to pressure from the French government to allow the Nigerian football team to take part in the World Cup in June . #% I would appeal to the wine enthusiasts here to contribute to the spirit of compromise in bringing about a common procedure . #% I am also pleased with the wording of the resolution on Bulgaria and Romania . #% All in all , no one would say it is a perfect directive , but I think we have achieved a workable compromise . #% During my recent visit to New York I spent some talk talking to the UNDP , which , in its handbook on dealing with political parties , says , ` yet we have seen that the absence of strong , accountable and competent political parties that can represent positions and negotiate change , weakens the democratic process ' . #% In fact , it would appear that it was pretty intransigent . #% We thought that Parliament should approach this professionally and responsibly . #% They seem to be particularly interested in sharing the good experience that they have insofar as local community initiatives of this kind are concerned . #% This is the stark reality of a market which is held back , not just by the slow evolution of debt-raising , but also by the nature of the institutional and regulatory barriers which fence in any further development across the European Union . #% We therefore do not have a voting list and we will be voting on something we can not see . #% However , in recognising that in years to come we will have the same problem with other industries that we have with the textile industry , I believe she is extremely and entirely accurate . #% 
My constituency is called Itchen , Test and Avon , and these are three rivers famous for their salmon . #% Paragraph 4 brazenly lists the measures taken `` to anticipate the application of some of the provisions of the new Constitutional Treaty '' despite the welcome rejection of the Constitution . #% I and my Labour colleagues are happy to support positive civilian and military cooperation and greater capacity building in order to help preserve peace , prevent conflicts and consolidate post-conflict rehabilitation . #% At a time when public accountability -- and not just concerning financial management -- is a big issue on both sides of the Atlantic , his arrival here and his appointment are to be much applauded . #% This has been generally agreed to be the best way to neutralise the difficult discussion about whose jurisdiction can apply . #% We will be looking very carefully , for example , at how the broad economic guidelines will be prepared , at just how successful the input of the Social Affairs and Employment Council will be in emphasising the need for employment and social cohesion when it formulates the broad economic guidelines . #% There is a much better way of doing this . #% The Commission ' s roles in the massive efforts to restore infrastructure and civil society in Kosovo will be of interest to the House . #% President Chirac often tries to portray France as a champion of European integration and blames other countries for any perceived lack of enthusiasm . #% Mr President , I thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ecofin Council for their recommendation which this European Parliament warmly endorses . #% Quite honestly , we have an awfully long way to go in terms of delivering the policy that the people deserve . #% The Commission and Parliament are right about one thing , the EU lacks democratic legitimacy . #% For Vietnam , the EU cooperation agreement offers potent opportunities for lively but constructive dialogue . #% Can you assure us , Mr President , that in future we will follow the list of speakers and not allow Members to intervene with long questions out of turn ? #% If one is to profile people by their characteristics , such as nationality and psycho-sociological features , and then decide from that who is likely to be a terrorist , one has to be very sure , it said , that there is a valid statistical link between the characteristics and the risks . #% As an MEP for London , I am glad to represent many Turks , Turkish Cypriots and Kurds . #% Yet the actual costs of fertiliser - because you have put in place anti-dumping legislation - have risen by 173 % . #% As a result the dialogue was suspended . #% A children 's act , on children 's rights , which will incorporate adoption law , both local and international , is now being prepared . #% I will read a headline from today 's which I picked up on the plane on my way here this morning : ` Car output near record levels ' . #% Rather than feed his people , he has chosen to maintain one million men under arms , with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military , irrespective of the sufferings of the civilian population , many of whom are rotting in political re-education camps or dying of starvation . #% The mass migration of Han Chinese and the arrival of the high-altitude railway at Lhasa have further consolidated Beijing 's hold on Tibet . #% He might also care to comment on the availability of the rendering facilities since much of the product is presently going into cold storage . #% I may have slightly changed my view because Greece is playing a very valuable role in leading and in coordinating regional cooperation . #% Perhaps that is something to consider in future . #% Mr President , I am delighted that the Parliament has adopted the Kindermann report and that in particular the amendments calling for the total phasing out of the battery cage system by 2009 were also adopted . #% So , it is very welcome that we are having a debate about this , but we need better-quality material ; we need material that is much more focused on real strategy and resource utilisation , rather than on these gimmicky words that Mrs Wallström appears to be giving you . #% Mr President , Mr van Velzen must be tired of hearing my congratulations . #% We need to ensure that we protect the rights of workers who do not have choices and whose agents know that they can exploit that weakness . #% Fourthly , we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security . #% If you do not have time for any of that , you could read your own Eurobarometer poll , which shows that less than half the citizens of Europe now think that the European Union is doing a good job . #% I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has achieved a broad consensus that the way forward is via clearly focused priorities which offer added value to the work of partners in Member States , agencies such as the World Health Organization , and non-governmental organisations . #% The current cost , both in personal terms and those of the workers and families affected and in terms of economic costs to industry and the social and health protection systems , warrants legislation in this area . #% But I want to illustrate my own comments on Mr Paasilinna 's work and the Commission proposals by looking to the past , to a book written by Mark Twain called ' A Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur ' . #% The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was a significant development in controlling this trade . #% It would be entirely wrong for anyone to believe that the submission of views imposed pressure on the Commission . #% From my constituency of London where a large portion of the population come from minority ethnic groups and where there is a growing number of children of mixed-race relationships , this is an exceedingly important directive . #% I apologize for using the jargon but it is good solid progress . #% I do not want to be rude , but you know , really , you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk . #% It is important we see development of this particular type of transport . #% Nor should it be forgotten that there is peace of a kind in most of Afghanistan now . #% I am sure that by the end of this year , or early next year , we will also have agreed a substantive proposal to open up the market for services . #% This report , passed by a large majority of the committee , will be the product of that review . #% It gives the consumer a wider choice and offers expansion for the quality producer . #% Why do they not use an independent logo to promote their goods - a logo not associated with a product that kills ? #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Mr President , I am not quite sure how we got from the subject of the need for high standards of protection to al-Qa ` ida ; I will try to concentrate on the report rather than what is not in it . #% In December in South Africa there was news of a large increase in the acreage in South Africa which is under cultivation for genetically modified products . #% What then do we do when we want to plan for language training , new recruitment or adaptation of buildings ? #% There is no evidence at the moment that would-be terrorists are entering the European Union or any Member States and seeking asylum , but the report seeks to make absolutely clear that there are safeguards and procedures to cover that eventuality . #% Mr President , as has already been said , this is one of the major issues facing the European Union . #% Among other measures , Governments also agreed common rules on providing refuge to those in need of political asylum and to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Can this fine ambition be achieved ? #% The events of Baia Mare in Romania and Doñana in Spain demonstrate the need to take action with regard to mining safety and mining waste safety . #% That is a very important provision . #% A flexible rule ceases to be a rule . #% There has to be a cut-off point where the practical and the scientific reality cuts in . #% But we will not see members of this Commission hounded by the press in any Member State of this Union . #% What Mr Dell ` Alba has said is absolutely right . #% Madam Commissioner , you have made a number of very sensible statements about the future direction of competition policy in the EU , including the statement on 13 December 2005 on improving rules for access to files in merger and anti-trust procedures . #% Firstly , as regards politics . #% I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign . #% How can we conclude ? #% Mr President , Commissioner Monti , we all realise that we are facing a crisis in terms of our press and communications policy for the Union 's institutions . #% Often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other . #% However , I have chosen to speak in today 's debate because some of the issues discussed in the report are at the core of what must be addressed if the European institutions themselves are to lift the cloud of mismanagement and waste which hangs over them from previous times . #% Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives or were exiled , and that part of Romania was subjected . #% 
I refer to the discrimination in terms of television coverage of the Friday morning session . #% Furthermore , there is no indication of any serious resolve on the part of EU Member States to increase defence expenditure or enhance their military capabilities in any significant manner . #% It is not as intellectually and politically seductive as all the things we talk about in the Committee on Institutional Affairs but perhaps in the long term it is going to be even more effective and even more important . #% We were therefore faced with the possibility of voting for amendments and voting for reports from our own committee which would have had a very serious economic impact in our own Member State . #% We asked when it would take place and we have been told January 2013 , but what role does the Commission see for Parliament ? #% Let us now offer all possible professional advice and assistance and encourage rapid reform without giving further opportunities to undemocratic forces who seek to overthrow the Turkish Government and frustrate Turkey 's progress towards membership of the European Union . #% I would urge that we put maximum emphasis on those aspects of the accession partnerships so that they will be ready to join us as soon as is possible . #% The theft of vehicles is of course very important , but it is what it leads on to and all other aspects connected with it that must focus our attention . #% I urge all of you who are thinking of voting against this , please do not . #% High-dose-rate brachytherapy requires high-tech equipment and , due to the high acquisition and maintenance costs of this equipment , Belarus needs assistance . #% Perhaps the President-in-Office could respond to my concern and tell me why the Council is so afraid of commissioning a study itself or of encouraging the Commission to do so ? #% I thank the rapporteur for the work he has done on this . #% What are we supposed to do when we are told the decision was taken over lunch , not even by ministers , but over lunch in some obscure Council working group without any minutes to justify to the public or , indeed , to politicians such as ourselves , why the EU is launching yet another politically sensitive trade dispute ? #% The call for the millennium must be EUR 1 per head on Europe ' s culture . #% It therefore applies to the self-employed , and rightly so . #% There is also a controversy over the relationship between the new European Union Charter and the existing European Convention of Human Rights . #% I could be wrong , but my understanding is that the purpose of parliamentary immunity for Members of Parliament acting in the Parliament - not outside the Parliament - is to allow you to represent the people who elected you . #% It is not just a case of Europe closing its doors and it will not happen . #% I would counter that very strongly . #% From France we have Mr Barrot , who will take on transport . #% There are also important data protection provisions that consumers feel concerned about in terms of giving up their data and going online , which also come under his area . #% Will they run the same risk with cooked meats ? #% I shall not dwell too much on the specifics of the Lisbon Summit . #% It is not just about mobility , it is about all the disabilities that we have to learn to cope with in our different ways , whether it is sight , hearing , learning difficulties , respiratory problems or seizures . #% We need to get into that conciliation position . #% Mr President , firstly , I wish to pick up on a couple of points in the joint resolution , which my group will not be supporting , points which seem to be missing from the speeches we have heard this morning : for example , the welcome given to the International Criminal Court while regretting the position of the United States in seeking to protect its own citizens from it . #% Many of us believe it brings that agreement into disrepute and that it is now null and void . #% Speaking purely personally , and off the top of my head , may I invite the Italian presidency to look at what happened in the early 1990s , before enlargement to Sweden , Finland and Austria ? #% The Commission originally came forward with a proposal to end tests . #% It is crucial for the future of Kosovo and the rest of us that those who fear that such a bold step will create a precedent choose the wise path of constructive abstention and do not seek to block the self-determination of Kosovans . #% The Commission appears to have missed its chance yet again . #% We all wait with interest as to how you will coordinate this policy , going forward in the new Commission and with your unique role wearing two hats . #% We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security . #% By that date I hope we will look back and say that we made the effort to help disabled people achieve , to enable them , and to make them real , whole people in the economies and communities in which they live . #% Parliament is leading the way on this , and Mr Schmidt has played a particularly successful role in updating the directives in this way and very much led the way on the derivatives issue . #% We need to condemn the appalling human rights record of this regime , in particular , in regard to the civilian population and the women and children in Sudan . #% They must be excluded from the provisions of this directive and I personally will support any amendments to this end . #% It therefore seems quite essential that consumer groups be represented on them . #% Of course , as you quite rightly say , excessive alcohol in pregnancy is a very serious matter . #% That is the thrust of our questions to the Council and the Commission : the development of the transatlantic partnership . #% Will MEPs , therefore , be able to attend , as observers , any of these sessions ? #% The first thing is to stress the importance which the Committee on the Environment , and I hope the European Parliament , places on the addition of an environmental dimension to the Lisbon Process of annual assessment of economic growth and social cohesion . #% All we were asking for was more flexibility on this issue . #% Although there were certainly remnants of the old-style quarrels about the pecking order between states , the IGC successfully managed to transcend these and leaves us with a fairly clear picture of what the European Union will be like for the foreseeable future . #% On the other hand , we are talking about some feedback from yourself , Mr President , for which we are very grateful . #% The ` fructose ' practice , whereby sugar is added to UK and other northern European wines , would have been banned if amendments urging this would have been passed and accepted by the House and the Commission . #% Mr President , in opening I wish briefly to refer to my speech earlier and to highlight the fact that this regulation on food aid requires the setting-up of a new comitology , committee 2 . #% The committee is counting the angels dancing on the end of a pin while the industry gradually collapses . #% I hope that we will not have to have a third reading , but we may have to just to make it absolutely clear that these automatic stays would not affect netting contracts , repo contracts and contracts in a regulated market . #% Can someone please explain to me who makes the decision arbitrarily to change the time of the vote in this Parliament without a by-your-leave ? #% Something needs to be done to take further the conclusions reached by our Member States that the WEU should now be integrated and its functions , or part of its functions , transferred to the European Union . #% Would the Commissioner like me to repeat Mr Rocard 's question ? #% I should like to quote his comments that : `` First , the Federal German Government 's policy of ending electricity production at nuclear power stations after a further 32 years has shown clearly that , at least in the case of the transport of spent fuel elements , safety problems do not exist . #% A Single Sky will be a major contribution to reducing pollution , emissions and wasted fossil fuel . #% His compliments to the shadow rapporteurs are more than returned . #% I totally agree with the Commissioner : Europe has to be , and is , about more than economics and trade . #% The Pérez Royo report rightly identifies concerns of some of the single currencies-watching spectators . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur . #% Mr President , along with many British Members of this House , I have received a large number of personal letters from constituents like the petitioners in this case . #% We in the European Union need to be patient and give Bangladesh every political and financial support , encourage good governance and the fight against corruption and Islamic fundamentalism . #% It is not possible to resign from the KGB any more than it is from La Cosa Nostra . #% All of us with families know that one can travel many miles , arrive in a caravan site late at night , maybe with fractious children , and certainly not have the energy to go and check out whether the camp-site is in fact safe . #% We are still talking about tied aid in the late years of this century . #% It is very important that the EU clearly expresses at this point its intention to phase out subsidies completely for this damaging product as the long-term aim of the reform of the tobacco market . #% On top of that , we have the new Seychelles agreement , following the agreements for Martinique , Madagascar and the Cape Verde Islands , agreed and approved in this House within the last year -- and may I say , to the shame of this House . #% So both personally , and as Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , I take this opportunity to thank you for your work and enthusiasm during your term of office . #% 
The lack of mechanisms for civil society negotiations in some ACP countries poses real problems . #% One point disappoints me - that is the stance of the EPP in all this . #% There is no requirement on Parliament to tighten up this legislation now . #% The differences on the 1967 borders and on the status of Jerusalem are as deeply entrenched today as is that much-disputed security wall . #% To say that the UK has low growth and low productivity is a travesty of misrepresentation when the UK economy is booming with falling unemployment and rising prosperity . #% It is only due to this House 's resilience that we are now at a stage where the Commission is recommending that it accepts some of our amendments . #% Then there is the big missing part of the jigsaw : access to justice . #% I should like to highlight a couple of issues , one being the role of logging companies . #% We need to look at the employment needs of carers . #% Commissioner , you must go back and say to Mr Liikanen that he should think again . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the Commission and , again , the rapporteur for the excellent and often very difficult task that she has undertaken . #% The creation of a market at European level implies a European responsibility to ensure that all regions benefit . #% This afternoon the Commission spokesman said that the Commission now had no plans to publish that note . #% On a broader basis , M-net , the European East Midlands network helping small businesses and craft enterprises and linking in with universities and colleges , is also important . #% I recently attended a local government conference looking at the national social inclusion plans . #% We also need to take account of changing technology and what may be the norm in differing Member States : what is the norm in Sweden is not necessarily the norm in Greece or in Portugal . #% Without going into detail on those , I can say that we now have a level playing field at European level . #% Today these events have taken place in Belgium , but tomorrow it could be the European Union . #% I am very pleased that Parliament , the Commission and the Council have highlighted animal welfare in their presentations . #% If I can return again to Lithuania , one of the most spectacular events in my life was a visit to the KGB Museum in Vilnius where my blood ran cold . #% With the initiatives that are going on in the European Union in developing this software , I would like to think that we can actually catch up and eventually take the lead . #% It is quite clear that comitology played its part in what turned out to be a totally ineffective operation . #% There has been comment today , some of them fair criticisms , about difficulties in administration , but I want to cite a success story . #% We must also have an exchange of best practice , particularly as mortality rates vary by 50 % between Member States . #% However , we need to do more to invest in the criminal justice system , as the European Parliament called for a year ago . #% Secondly , I want to urge a generous response from the EU and Member States for humanitarian aid to the countries and communities that have been devastated . #% Mr President , there has thankfully been a change in European Community law over the last 30 years from freedom of movement of persons being seen as purely an economic issue - functional mobility - to it being seen as a personal right . #% We should recognise , as America recognises , that one of the primary functions of the nation state is to protect the rights of its citizens in its own courts and we should respect the Americans ' view that their ability to exercise that responsibility would be prejudiced if they allowed their soldiers or other American citizens to appear before that court . #% As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture , I should also like say a word of thanks for the cross-party cooperation I had in that committee on this most important issue . #% The world must know this ( ... ) . #% Mr President , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party warmly welcomes the plan crafted by Kofi Annan yesterday in Switzerland . #% Will he join me in welcoming that and will he agree with me that this demonstrates that countries and regions of the UK are finally taking their places in a Europe of the regions ? #% I am sure that if she is not planning to go , it is not a symptom of the downgrading of the status of the conference . #% This is a nonsense . #% In each of these three cases , the constituent has spent his or her life savings on the purchase of a house and land in Valencia . #% Mr President , as I indicated in my first answer , there are certain budgetary limitations that have the effect of restricting some of the actions that we undertake in the region , not only as the Commission but also in our cooperative activities with other organisations . #% I would like to talk about two of the amendments on introducing this precautionary principle . #% This is not about interference in commercial decisions but about making sure that we maximise the chances of us all being winners rather than simply the passive victims of change . #% It is no surprise that the new kids on the EMU block are going along with the Delors vision . #% Certainly , everyone ought to be warned about the dangers of the sun and that is why I am very much in favour of national campaigns . #% This is about stopping people dropping dead at work . #% It was quite wrong to say that there was anything here going against the Accession Treaty . #% It is extraordinary that he should talk about bringing the European Parliament closer to the people when his government is about to impose a system of proportional representation on the United Kingdom which is , as I understand it - and we are still waiting to find the definition - a closed list system . #% It is very easy for us to wring our hands over all the human rights abuses around the world . #% For the good of Turkish society , democracy needs to be pluralist , secular and built on a bed-rock of respect for human rights , including those of its Kurdish minorities . #% But political union may not just be the idle dream of a few federalists . #% The guidelines we have laid down there are useful . #% I welcome Mrs Korhola 's acceptance of Amendment No 48 and , although she does not think it is perfect , I am very glad she can accept it . #% The San José process should continue providing an opportunity for an exchange of views and discussion not only through the conferences - at two of which I have had the opportunity to speak on behalf of Parliament - but also through greater involvement of civil society in the region . #% That is why this rule was amended : to abolish this distinction between different categories of former Member . #% We have no confidence in this ridiculous voting system . #% The report was passed in the Committee on the Environment by 40 votes to 0 with 2 abstentions . #% Mr President , Commissioner , the answer is , of course , very satisfactory but I wondered if you were aware Commissioner that the strategic policy planning and early warning units in the Commission has 20 staff , 11 of whom are responsible for the Balkans and only one responsible for Africa which is your responsibility . #% I do not see why we can not trust consumers to pick a product from other Members of the European Union and to be protected by the financial services authorities of those other Members of the European Union . #% We need to recognise that the greatest engine of employment growth in all our countries is the sector called ` small and medium-sized enterprises ' . #% In some Member States there is not even a definition of terrorism , so terrorists can escape conviction and imprisonment . #% Does the Commission accept that serial complaints are themselves injurious to the Community interest ? #% I can tell you that I have been at sea recently on board Her Majesty 's ships with women who are navigation officers , aviators , filling all sorts of complex and senior roles within the British armed forces . #% Aviation is one of the most rapidly growing sources of greenhouse gases . #% China still has a long way to go in introducing democracy and respect for human rights and convincing us that it wishes to be a peaceable partner in the international community . #% I welcome the Commission 's answer . #% Perhaps you can correct him instead of correcting us . #% We need to find more effective , quicker methods involving local people to overcome the scourge of landmines , not just in Afghanistan , but elsewhere as well . #% There is much greater emphasis , for example , on the rights of children and procedures for the vulnerable . #% We are not here to sell those rights for 30 pieces of silver . #% What we need , Commissioner , is a simplified procedure for the items that have been omitted so that they can come onto the list quickly , and for that we need the 36-month timescale . #% 
The directive has the potential to fulfil the needs of everyone , to protect the environment and public health , to give the consumers a range of products from which they can make a choice and also to enable the industry to sell freely and fairly in the marketplace . #% I share his concerns at the level of antibiotic resistance being found in bacterial infections of livestock . #% However dark and uncertain the future may be , we must stand firm behind the USA as that noble country did for us in our darkest hour . #% Only through greater openness to partnerships that go beyond what a lowest common denominator WTO deal could now provide , will the EU begin to address the global competitiveness agenda of the future . #% Indeed , we have been very conscious of the fact that these reforms need to be implemented as quickly as possible so that staff do not get disillusioned and they can see that change is ahead of them and new working methods coming before them . #% However , it is extremely disappointing -- as everyone has said -- that we could not get something on journey times , one of the key issues ; or on stocking densities . #% What responsibilities should we give them in the Treaties ? #% But at least he is an elected politician , unlike Baroness Cathy Ashton , who really is the true representation of the modern-day political class . #% We have a new process set up , but that vigilance is going to be important . #% Norway and Iceland have good fishing stocks and they are not part of the common fisheries policy . #% I will respond properly to her report at the end of this morning ' s debate . #% Lastly , I would like to refer to the question of the posts which we have put in reserve and we would like to ensure that the conditions for the reserve are met before the posts are released - including the fact that the Commission has the capacity to use the posts during the next year in terms of the vacancies . #% Many of the problems apparent in the legislation at first reading have been substantially resolved by the Council at second reading . #% We have tabled two amendments which we hope the House will accept . #% Many distinguished Members of this House have been prominent in ensuring that the European Union has a role in health policy , to say nothing of the established and growing part it now plays in research or food safety , environmental policies , for example . #% Yes , we have to simplify the system . #% Let us not lose sight of the fact that a budget has been presented to us today . #% I therefore fully commend the resolution 's call - and I am pleased to hear Commissioner Špidla respond positively to it today - to draw up a charter for the protection of the rights of breast cancer patients and currently sick people in the workplace to facilitate their reintegration into the world of work . #% The Commission should have the guts to strip away this pretence and withdraw this directive . #% More than two years ago they promised to do this , yet there has been no action . #% We support the French initiative . #% Mr President , the ports of Harwich , Felixstowe and Tilbury are in my constituency . #% It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality . #% I made my report available in all accessible formats at my own expense . #% Mr President , it is an interesting statistic that there are more nurses from Malawi living in Manchester , in the United Kingdom , than there are living in Malawi ; and there are more doctors from Ethiopia living in Chicago than there are in Ethiopia . #% We saw that we needed a pro-active approach , we needed to develop a concept of global justice for all people and to build a worldwide security system based on active involvement . #% Madam President , we in Parliament are rightly particularly attentive to areas where ethnic tensions lead to conflict and attempts to overthrow democracy and the rule of law . #% I can not say they have become more European -- perhaps Mr Poettering should work on them a little more . #% I am one of those who voted for it . #% I agree with Mr Verde that the sooner this directive is implemented the better . #% The Commission has taken great pride in touting its credentials in matching GSP benefits with rights standards . #% I am prepared to say on the record here and now that they can present health hazards and they need to be treated in a special way . #% This needs to be stressed with great vigour . #% What works in one country in the EU may not work in another . #% Mr Schulz talked earlier of workers ' rights , and of course these are important , but we must also pay attention to non-workers ' rights , the rights of those who are willing and eager to work but have no job . #% A number of incidents involving freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were reported in the run-up to and during the summit itself . #% These agreements are a two-way process and we look to you , Commissioner , to be able to enforce it . #% You will see that I was present because I voted in all of the roll-call votes , but I am not on the list . #% Up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this . #% Baroness Ludford spoke quite rightly about the effects of this on the City of London and the legal profession . #% However , the issues which deserve close attention are not confined to alleged misuse of international funds . #% A lot has changed in that time : the abolition of frontiers , the single customs document and better roads , which means you can now drive for long periods of time without any natural interruption . #% This deceitful attempt of the German Presidency behind closed doors to put together a package that can be rammed through the Member States without a referendum is a recipe for failure . #% We have racist and fascist parties in France and Italy , Belgium and Denmark that have been with us for some time . #% Eleven EU countries refuse to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings , including Britain , France and Spain . #% Do you remember that - the great proclamation a few years ago that we were going to create the high-tech , dynamic economy with full employment ? #% It is the biggest engine to break down barriers between communities and nationalities that we have ever seen - bigger than any EU directive can possibly be . #% Quite simply the challenge which is facing us today is to make quite sure that we get it right and that enlargement benefits the European Union and does not undermine it . #% One effect , for example , would be the omission of the Atlantic routes . #% Therefore , the EPP takes the view that we should begin the process of freezing the financial arrangements with Turkey and that we should stop the MEDA programme in all respects forthwith , except for those matters dealing with human rights , democratization and the development of civil society . #% We talk about it ; let us hope this time , Commissioner , you are able to do something about it . #% At the moment , progress is very variable in the different Member States . #% Simply laying down guidelines to say that questions have to be within the remit of the European Union and of the institutions seems to be sensible . #% Amendment No 8 , for example , deals with occupational pensions which are not state-provided benefits and therefore currently outside the scope of the regulation . #% First of all , I think it obviously is crucial that EU spending be kept under tight control and that expenditure should be used as efficiently as possible . #% I say ` an improved attempt ' because I see the report itself as being unimaginative - unimaginative in terms of how we can improve on projected growth figures ; unimaginative in terms of recognising that we are constantly having to revise the growth figures and we do not really know what to do in terms of trying to increase employment , growth and investment in Europe ; unimaginative because , whilst it accepts that we have relatively high unemployment in Europe , it does little other than to accept the fact that jobs are being created but are also being lost . #% How do we deal with that problem when we talk about extending peacekeeping forces ? #% Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement . #% We will also vote in favour of Amendment No 43 , which proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of this directive and vote against other amendments that try to be too prescriptive . #% The Commission , through its quality support group , we in the Joint Assembly , and not least the beneficiary governments should all uphold our responsibilities in this respect . #% I suggest to you that this wording and much of the wording here is not only complex , difficult and opaque but actually goes in entirely the wrong direction . #% Two things were clear from that hearing : there might have been other minor problems , but there were two major problems . #% That industry is starting to reconfigure and to work together with support from the British Government , using European funds , to tackle these issues . #% I am particularly concerned about the situation that micro-businesses find themselves in . #% Mr President , I would like to place on record my appreciation to Mr Berlusconi for the gift of a tie . #% Madam President , earlier this year in February I was privileged enough to go to New Zealand to look at some of the fisheries management that takes place very successfully down there . #% 
The Romanian Government has decided to be judged by action and not by words . #% Ultimately , democracy too will prevail and the mullahs of the Council of Guardians will hopefully return to their intended spiritual and pastoral role . #% Finally , and more positively , I want to make it clear on behalf of the Socialist Group that we will support the work of the European Union Ombudsman , respecting his independence , with friendly criticism where appropriate , but primarily backing him and assisting him in pressing the European Union institutions and bodies to implement the recommendations in his reports particularly when he has found maladministration . #% I have been to Kyrgyzstan several times in recent years , as it emerged from those dark days of the Soviet empire and set the pace for the region in terms of political , economic and health reforms . #% Probably uniquely in this House , I actually knew Leyla Zana before she was tried and convicted . #% I also welcome what you said about pooled data , which is essential to ensuring that smaller institutions can take advantage of a new risk-sensitive framework by pooling data with similar , smaller institutions . #% The outcome of the Florence Summit does little to give confidence to business and workers across the European Union and particularly in a constituency such as mine in the northwest of England which is so dependent on these two industries for its success and prosperity . #% We may also have to look again at carbon sinks . #% As the person who co-chaired the Interparliamentary Conference and got the agreement on that co-chairing , I was surprised that we had no press officer . #% We do not , however , think a new extra procedure - an emergency procedure - is needed , and the wording should be tightened up to show that on shared competences detailed legislation can sometimes be laid down and ... #% Does the President-in-Office not agree that this current situation reinforces the need for Western powers to take seriously the dangerous potential insecurity in this region , particularly in view of the running sore of Kashmir between India and Pakistan and the ongoing problems of disputes between India and China ? #% That is a salutary thought for all of us as we contemplate the challenges of enlargement . #% Streamlined procedures for Member States wishing to aid employment schemes are to be welcomed and sensitivity to local circumstances is also desirable . #% Clearly we must change . #% Would the Commission agree that the economic and financial risks associated with accession were subordinated to the political commitment to extend the system itself ? #% I refer to the Transport Council and in particular to the latest report on the concrete implementation of the strategy , which showed a distinct lack of progress on many fronts in the transport field . #% But I would like to feel that the Minister was giving me some kind of response as to whether in his view the Council thinks this is an important priority . #% Yet the range of challenges to global health today is wide and the prospects of achieving the international goals are daunting . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Tindemans on the completion of this extremely difficult task and thanking him for the extremely flexible way in which he has approached this debate and for the fact that he has been prepared to take on board the observations of other members of the committee . #% It is the difficulties of administration in Brussels rather than the lack of effect on the ground which is besetting their progress . #% It has confounded the pundits who said it would never survive without the Czech Republic , and today I proudly salute their combined cooperation with the Allies in Kuwait , where they are providing chemical warfare decontamination expertise . #% We therefore can not agree that Mr Jarzembowski is correct in wanting to limit the Commission 's application of competition rules to its present mandate . #% The relays act as a uniquely important bridge between the European Union 's policy-making mechanism and the citizens to whom we are all accountable . #% Mr President , there are , not unnaturally , different assessments in this Parliament regarding the Treaty of Nice , but even those who are highly critical of the Treaty - and there are many - will agree in this debate on the future of Europe that the best way forward is to use the post-Nice procedures and to make the most of them to improve our Union , to rectify the shortcomings of Nice and to have a proper debate on the future of the Union . #% While I note that the Commissioner says that it was a sincere and in-depth exchange of views - and I am sure that was true on the side of the Europeans - I am not convinced that would be the case on the side of the Chinese . #% We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions . #% There seems to be this refrain across the House at the moment that we should have 10 to 12 Commissioners . #% I do not believe that export refunds are the answer to this crisis . #% We have to make certain that we have a proper asylum system that is not skewed by the overemphasis on illegal immigration . #% Companies also suffer from a less mobile workforce and the additional bureaucracy , administration and costs involved in managing multiple pensions systems . #% While I wish to think of the individuals and families of those who died or were injured in the railway accident , I am afraid that the two accidents are very different . #% I would draw the Council 's attention to points 8 and 10 of the report - if it was here . #% Parliament habitually increases targets - any targets . #% Mr Prodi , Mrs Reding and Mrs Schreyer , we are relying on you to do it better this coming year . #% There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action . #% For our Group , this is an extremely important piece of legislation . #% The point was forcefully made yesterday by a delegation from the European Bureau of Consumers ' Unions which met with members of the Convention . #% As one of the great democracies , India attracts the rage of extremists . #% Enlargement is actually the solution to the problems which concern our voters - the concerns about crime and drugs , about the environment , about jobs and a better future for our children . #% The Commission 's proposals were certainly better than what is now proposed in those areas . #% This is something that is totally alien to me and I find it very difficult to understand and to stand here saying this . #% Simply stop paying this monstrous bureaucratic dictatorship , which has no respect for either the governments or the people of Europe . #% However , there is no doubt that the measures agreed by Parliament will make an important difference for many workers throughout the EU . #% It is clear as well that the actions of the market in the longer term will lead to lower interest rates which will make it cheaper to borrow for investment and in turn will create jobs . #% Italy , the country in which Mr Buttiglione is still a minister , has not implemented the European arrest warrant . #% However , our policy is not a neutrality of indifference . #% We are critical about the human rights records of other governments , but seem very unwilling to criticise when it comes to the European Union itself . #% There is a risk that the bureaux will become top-heavy superstructures . #% Mr President , a year ago last April we sent back from the Committee on Transport and Tourism a report to the Commission , for consideration also by the Council , on the transport of nuclear material by air . #% It urgently needs help with the current government 's ambitious development programme . #% I believe this is an unacceptable waste of taxpayers ' money . #% I hope that those in the Christian Democrat Group who still support it will not go along with that , but will support our amendment . #% He has been very courteous to the other groups tonight and we can all say that we appreciate the time he has taken and the strenuous efforts he has made to find a compromise in certain particularly difficult areas of this report . #% I thought that the collection of data on employment and economic expenditure - the so-called tourism satellite accounts - was particularly relevant in this regard and we pushed hard for this to be included as part of the regulation . #% in writing . - Conservative MEPs believe that in the current financial and economic climate , proposals for new EU expenditure must be subjected to rigorous scrutiny . #% For the governments to come up with a draft of the Treaty - laudable as it is , and supporting it as we do in this Parliament with regard to actions of non-discrimination for disabled people - that does not cover all of the areas of European legislation would fail to meet the demands of 37 million disabled European citizens . #% The reason , very simply , is that it seems to me to devalue animals caught in the wild , as though they are a cheap supply that can be brought in whilst all our concern goes towards zoo-bred animals and the contents of laboratories . #% The problem is that my notes are in Brussels , not here in Strasbourg , so when I saw this in the Minutes I asked to raise it . #% The Brok report should be a warning to them in relation to corruption and reform of public administration . #% If we do not , then we will find that in six months time we are back to playing games again . #% I am also pleased that it is the European Parliament 's petitions procedure that has enabled that to happen . #% But I am quite happy to accept the PPE-DE Group 's oral amendment . #% We have to ask if these existing European rules and regulations are being properly followed . #% You have overseen the Lisbon Agenda : it was sunk without trace way before the credit crunch hit us . #% It is also , as Mr Van Lancker has said , an issue , which touches very strongly on poverty . #% As we have seen from the Court of Auditors ' consistent refusal to sign off the EU accounts , it is an area where the EU itself needs to put its house in order . #% 
Also , we are told that each spring the European Council will consider an overall report to be produced by the Commission that will deal with structural indicators to be agreed . #% The Commission has every reason to believe that Croatia will apply this legislation seriously . #% It is this area , more than any other , that has been the focus of my report on behalf of Parliament . #% I believe this demonstrates what many of us have always felt : practical advances in EU civil law like this can assist to make Europe more popular we get it right . #% It must be a great cause for cheer in European cities today that we no longer have to breathe that `` palpable brown air '' . #% Therefore , to have completed a deal within the space of two weeks was perhaps a little bit beyond the capacity of the Union . #% This man is a monster . #% Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today , I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken . #% For more than 100 years , The Hague Conference on Private International Law has worked tirelessly and with an ever-growing number of countries across the globe to put together numerous international conventions on civil law subjects : sale of goods , testamentary dispositions , child abduction , maintenance obligations and road-traffic accidents . #% We now have a drugs bill for Parkinson 's disease higher than the drugs bill for cancer . #% Therefore , we will not support the two amendments by the Liberals and the Greens . #% Mr President , I should like to say one thank you and make four short points . #% Parliament did everything it could to enable that to happen . #% No farmer -- and I speak as a farmer -- wants to use chemicals unnecessarily . #% They assume they think it is worth taking risks -- criminal risks at that -- in overworking tired drivers , and publicity risks if they are found guilty . #% There are two opportunities for the European Parliament to look at the process of EMU . #% It was the year of three types of Commission : two months of the old Commission that had a number of problems that we all know about ; six months of no Commission whatsoever because they were not taking any management decisions ; and then the rest of the year was with the new Commission who had no time to implement any of the reforms . #% In April we overwhelmingly approved that Economic Partnership Agreement with reservations about the situation in Zimbabwe . #% Is it any wonder that people complain of a democratic deficit in Europe when debate about new laws in the Council of Ministers takes place behind closed doors ? #% Mr President , I warn in advance that God help the Council if it comes in here wanting to lecture us for half an hour on a debate it has not heard . #% The Turkish Government fully appreciates the political importance of the Zana case for the European Parliament . #% While the Commission reiterates its commitment to the territorial integrity of Indonesia , it is also firmly convinced that the conflict in Aceh can only be ended by political means . #% I must tell you that women 's rights have gone downhill , not up . #% Come on , which way are you facing , Mr Knapman ? #% That gives extra flexibility . #% The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda . #% Some who supported the change were merely misguided , but others knew exactly what they were doing ! #% On two issues I believe that the Council should speak clearly and forcefully in its conclusions . #% If I look at the internal market area , issues like the European patent , patient mobility and the European private company law project are all issues which will read across . #% In particular the authorisation procedures for new testing methods must be accelerated . #% I also believe that the undermining by Chairman Arafat of Prime Minister Abu Mazen has further muddied the waters , and lends credibility to those who argue that Arafat has no interest in going the last mile for peace and security if he is not at centre stage . #% That is the stupidity of this . #% The Constitution is of such far-reaching significance that its rejection in one or more of the Member States in the forthcoming referenda would render it void . #% That is why we support the rapporteur , who has been as careful as ever to ensure consistency between EU legislation and the international framework provided by the ICAO . #% That is something of which we should be proud and not ashamed . #% We must recognise the reality : the Americans need to be brought gently along and persuaded that this is not a witch-hunt against American forces , it is about having international law ruling the whole of global politics . #% For that reason I focussed this report on just two key issues : gaps in existing legislation and where further work can have genuine added value . #% The paper work will mount even as the lines of responsibility and decision-making in the Commission become even more confused . #% There has been too much anti-Americanism in Europe recently and Europe needs to remember what it owes to America . #% Too often we have seen abuses in the system which puts couples ' wishes before the child 's interests . #% Madam President , I just wish to say in response to that profound statement that before the problem arose it had been contemplated in one of our proposals , even in advance of the BSE problem . #% If any lobbyist had lobbied against Parliament in the way that our staff are lobbying against Parliament , we would have expelled the lobbyist under our Rules . #% There is , in fact , no trial date . #% The application of health and safety legislation to self-employed workers is an important subject , not least because of the ever-growing number of self-employed , subordinated , sub-contracted or atypical workers . #% Internal pay rates , some have told us , are confidential . #% They fear this directive because they have been told that these products will be banned , that testing will be prohibitive , and that what remains will be swallowed up in a restrictive and prescriptive regime . #% In countries like Zimbabwe where 20 % of the population are positive , vaccines , in my view , are the only hope . #% Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee . #% But they ignored the people . #% This constitutes a hidden trade barrier . #% author . - Mr President , I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer , the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan , and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi - a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous . #% Such a structure will enable reconstruction to be managed by means of specially adapted procedures which are unlike those used in the Commission ' s departments . #% That is a total misunderstanding of the position as he knows it to be . #% 14 000 people now work in an industry worth USD 350 million a year . #% We have to be able to say , as the motion of the Socialist Group does , that the rule of law must apply , that we are a Community of law , and unless we have a universal application , which never happened in the wake of BSE , of the regulations , the situation can not improve . #% It is highly regrettable that we have not been able to approve this today , for the reasons outlined by my colleague Mr David Martin . #% That leaves the excuse of what some call the need for confidentiality , trust or even secrecy . #% But none of us here doubt the importance of your role because a domestic Euroland government faced with reviving a faltering economy has very few weapons at its disposal . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I am sure you will be aware of the recent announcement by the UK Electoral Commission that the people of Gibraltar should vote in the South-West of the United Kingdom at the next European Elections , following a decision by the European Court . #% I thought the EU was all about the free movement of goods , services and labour . #% I hope that as part of the accession process Turkey will be persuaded to seek a political solution to the desire of the Kurdish people to express their identity , perhaps through some kind of political devolution . #% I would remind the House and the Commission that 90 % of some 5 000 legislative acts adopted every year in the Union are under delegated powers . #% But , apart from that , the ALDE Group fully supports the proposals that are brought before us . #% Mr President , this is a question for you . #% I would make one final plea to the British Government : please listen and accept this report so we can plan for the future . #% The first question is in relation to investment . #% 
Notwithstanding these concerns , we must act in concert to address the common threat of climate change and environmental pollution . #% The European institutions like to pride themselves on their international leadership in terms of policy on climate change , the greatest threat we face , and yet this regulation is a tragedy of missed opportunity and sets back the potential of our climate policy by decades . #% I thank the Commissioner for what she said about state aid , but a more flexible regime is still needed simply to level the playing field . #% No , please do not scoff , because that kind of attitude is exactly how all the demagogues and dictators down the ages got away with it . #% Effective labelling , so that the consumers can choose both the context and the regularity of what they are getting , is the best way forward . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , it is a pleasure to be able to present this report on behalf of the committee tonight . #% So , if and when these guidelines become rules , dictating to national governments what they must do , then we would oppose them . #% That is the extent of the competition that we are now facing . #% In addition there were references to diverse political concepts from CFSP to ESDP and the Echelon project . #% He should be congratulated on all that , because he has brought excellent conclusions into this report . #% Madam President , I should like to endorse Mr Dupuis ' remarks about not calling Macedonia `` FYROM '' and to recommend that the whole of Parliament align its practice with the Dutch text of this week 's agenda which lists the Council and the Commission statements on Wednesday morning as being about `` Macedonia '' , whereas the English text says `` FYROM '' . #% If we look at what Mr Solana identified as the aims of European Union involvement in Afghanistan , women are not mentioned : women 's rights are just not there . #% Although I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's words now , it is disappointing that the fourth framework programme did not identify diabetes as a major problem . #% In actual fact they have come to an agreement and they have sorted it out themselves , yet you have not dropped the anti-dumping legislation against that particular company . #% Will the Commissioner confirm that she will apply this argument to the Commission 's own aid to business ? #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming the Commissioner 's clear commitment to producing the new directive as soon as possible and by thanking him for outlining a number of important measures on which he and his departments are already working . #% I conclude by saying that this has nothing to do with revolution or our socialist leader , who says that these are undercover censure motions . #% This is work that cries out for more parliamentary involvement and I know that this is something The Hague Conference would also welcome . #% The Commission should also welcome the great involvement of Members of this Parliament , which she proposes . #% We are also concerned about the fact that this is a rapidly expanding sector so we are likely to see the number of people killed and injured on our roads increase year upon year because the basic rules are being ignored and not being enforced . #% I would not want to be committed to the view that if a rule is ignored it should necessarily be changed . #% Mr President , in the heat of the debate Mr Cars made some remarks about me which perhaps go slightly beyond the normal rules of debate in this House , although they would be unexceptional in the British House of Commons . #% I would appeal to the President and to the Parliament , and certainly to the Council , that we make an urgent appeal to the authorities in Saudi Arabia for mercy and clemency to be shown to all five . #% Please give them economic independence . #% Mr President , I am very glad that you are being very tolerant on time this morning . #% I hope we can achieve a workable solution to these issues . #% Again that is in the amended directive and will be made available via the Equasis database . #% There remains strong appreciation of Russia 's internal struggle against fundamentalism and support for the global war against international terrorism . #% I rise not about the substance of the letter but to ask whether it is normal practice for the Commission to respond to letters from Members in this way and whether it is acceptable that there should be a ten-week delay . #% The ELDR resolution that has been tabled takes the same view . #% I hope Ms McKenna will not take offence if I give her praise in her absence as she too has played her part in looking for and helping us to find compromises which make sense , which do not betray anybody and which take forward the concept of food safety for the peoples of Europe . #% I would like to explain our thinking here . #% These are part of the same proposals . #% Mr President , first I should like to thank Mr Böge for the very competent way that he chaired the many meetings of the committee . #% The nub of the problem is that we have to find ways to finance development over and above the national commitment to 0.7 % . #% I contend that we will have , as other speakers have said , the absolute right and need to argue with our Congressional colleagues , particularly those in the Senate . #% I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again , that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island . #% I very much welcome what you said about the flexibility and evolutionary approach with regard to the internal ratings-based approach . #% Madam President , I hope nobody in this Chamber is unaware of , or in any doubt about , the seriousness of the crisis which confronts us today . #% It did nothing for the trust that we are trying to build up between the two institutions . #% In my view , nothing has changed since the Council took that decision and I would not wish to have those very difficult decisions reopened . #% Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur from this side of the House , I am delighted that the Commissioner has set out quite clearly a positive case for the Services Directive . #% I wholeheartedly welcome this sensible step to tackle one of the key problems hindering the potential boom in e-commerce across Europe , namely the difficulty in verifying the identity of users and consumers . #% I know I speak for everyone when I say I wish her the fullest and speediest possible recovery . #% The European architecture now consists of a series of agreements - the European Economic Area , for example , the association agreements with Central and Eastern Europe , the CEFTA , the free trade agreements with EFTA countries . #% I would hope that a form of words can be devised in the Council meeting on Monday that will take this issue of guaranteed access into account . #% Good God , here we are in the European Parliament and one of our Member States is relying on the lottery for regional funding , while people are still sleeping on the streets . #% What happened is that the Community created new trade frontiers well beyond the present EU boundaries . #% They are interdependent and responsibility for the consequences of pollution should be shared and allocated between them . #% Of course , this will not always be feasible . #% That shows for instance that by the end of the campaign over 20 million more Europeans were convinced that cancer is preventable and that the various risk factors - for example smoking and lack of fruit , vegetables and cereals in the diet - were better known after the campaign . #% We need to do more work on it , because it needs to deliver benefits for business , otherwise there is no point in having it at all . #% Other colleagues in this House take a different view of what is right and wrong . #% I would ask that we make it more visible in years to come . #% Your problem , and it is mostly your problem , would be better solved by intergovernmental cooperation . #% Therefore , we decline to give Mr Gollnisch the benefit of parliamentary immunity of this House , and that is the committee 's recommendation to the Presidency and to the House . #% Mr President , I just want to raise a case of the need for fair treatment of someone who has been arrested in Spain on an extradition warrant from Morocco . #% Though the report contains some useful suggestions for the avoidance of future outbreaks of FMD , it is seriously flawed in a number of important respects . #% The issues that he raised were covered very briefly in the report that I prepared for Parliament back in 2000 , where we indicated that we were looking for a best-practice approach . #% The report sets out our criteria for the assessment of candidates , including European commitment and the gender balance that is achieved across the whole team . #% What a pleasure it has been to be of small assistance to Romania in her move towards this wonderful accession moment . #% The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council . #% Whether they do or not , will the Council at least seek to strengthen these rather vague guidelines of 30 September which allow loopholes contravening the Statute ? #% The religious fundamentalists of Iran are not rational . #% It is important for suppliers to be obliged positively to provide safety data sheets to users . #% Mr President , this motion is both topical and urgent . #% 
Mr President , last month we witnessed the remarkable sight of Bulgaria , an ex-communist country , electing the party by its former King , Simeon II , to office , having removed all legal barriers to his entry , ironically in preparation for EU membership . #% We see the Foundation playing a role in that . #% Would he say what steps the Presidency will take to promote efforts to open up financial and trade relations with Northern Cyprus once accession negotiations have been started successfully ? #% I also believe personally that the language on slavery struck the right tone in speaking of it now as being a crime against humanity . #% In Swaziland there are about 3000 nurses and Swaziland is training about 100 per year . #% It is also important to remember that in the road transport sector by far the largest element of the price of fuel is taxation . #% We now need to really make that work . #% Apart from the purely pragmatic argument that if you ban something then people want to do it , there are strong human rights arguments as to why banning is unacceptable . #% That is why I advised caution at the beginning of my remarks . #% Mr President , this is a very good report . #% I trust that European political parties , including the representatives of Mr Bonde 's party , will be galvanised during the period of reflection to contribute to a resolution of the crisis , and especially to publish European papers about those fundamental questions concerning the future of Europe . #% I think this is a good example of smart regulation , but may I just conclude by making two final observations . #% They are new points , and therefore we have a problem in that our governments would appear - at least in some cases - to be divided on this issue . #% We have to make sure our workforce has the proper skills to be able to develop our economy , because our competitive advantage is largely skills-based and that is where the future of the European economy lies . #% MEPs should not make EU laws in a country that breaks EU laws . #% This is why we can not allow the appointment of Pinochet to Chile 's Senate , due on the 11 of next month , and subject to protest by all the main political parties in Chile , to pass without international protest from ourselves . #% What plans does the Presidency have to start a dialogue with Parliament upon security and defence questions , and when will the Presidency 's Minister of Defence make a statement upon the development of a common policy for European security and defence ? #% Mr President , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group and my British colleagues , I very much welcome Mr Zappalà 's tremendous work on a very complex text . #% They have made an historic step in their proposal to Council in taking up the need to develop a better training strategy , albeit only in certain sectors at present , to equip the construction sector , architects , etc. with the necessary skills to work in an environmentally positive way . #% This leads to the fourth point I should like to mention , which is about complaints . #% We still have problems with regard to legislation , particularly the fact that the crime and the practice of torture still exist and there is no clear definition of what torture is . #% On this tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster we must rekindle our fears and our concerns to ensure that we have the determination to take the action necessary to stop this ever happening again . #% We would much rather make our own agreements on our own terms . #% The Commission itself , through Commissioner Tugendhat , when he was budget Commissioner , appeared to accept that interpretation . #% What iron was to the 19th century , information technology will be to the 21st . #% First of all to the Minister , Mrs Lehtomäki , would she accept that , as the debate has already underlined , circumstances have completely changed since Finland first devised the Northern Dimension ? #% So if that is the case , and if that is our guiding principle , then that has to be an essential element in our dealings with Burma . #% The 2003 resolution called for equal access to health care for people with MS , but some drugs , like beta interferon , are still not uniformly available . #% Mr President , the Council of Ministers ' failure to call for an immediate ceasefire meant we stood back and let the infrastructure of Lebanon be destroyed and led to more than one thousand civilian deaths both in Lebanon and Israel , not to mention the cluster bombs which will lead to even more . #% Mr President , I would like to intervene on behalf of Mr Pannella of the Italian Radicals , who is in Italy , to make a point of order regarding the calendar . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions . - Madam President , I should like to congratulate Ms Frassoni on her report . #% It was important that the report should have included the particular amendments as recommended by the PSE Group . #% Member States have different priorities , different trading links and traditions , despite the EU 's detrimental attempts to change these . #% We should recognise the progress Romania has made in strengthening the Court of Audit , in judicial reform and in the introduction of the new Constitution , and we should not rule out a successful close to the negotiations this year . #% The collapse of a corporate giant like Enron and the reverberations of such a collapse for employees , for small investors , for pensioners , convince us that , if there is a way of helping prevent such misery for some of our citizens , then we should of course pursue it . #% Having said that , I wish to enter a note of regret at the rather negative and fearful approach characterised in the Verts/ALE Group 's amendments . #% That report on the social situation in Europe was scathing about the Services Directive , and this House voted to reject it . #% It delivers oppression , lack of choice and material and political stagnation . #% I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because , increasingly , it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing . #% We MEPs who follow these issues recognise that . #% Broadly , there are two such roles : engagement in the major reconstruction programme and collaboration in the framework of UNMIK coordinating initiatives with other international donors . #% This is flexible and it is adapted to the needs of different policy areas , and should remain so . #% In the areas which we did have problems with such as sport and minority languages , the bulk of the money has been used . #% I should again like to press the point and ask when this sitting is going to be properly televised and treated like any other . #% You can not even begin to attack the problem . #% Sadly , the denial of the prisoners ' right to access to normal civil courts and the protection of the US Constitution has been backed by the US courts on the grounds that Guantanamo Bay -- even though the US is in actual control of the base -- is not sovereign US territory . #% Similarly , Commissioner de Silguy , issued a warning to Europe 's financial institutions on 7 May 1998 urging them to look at this matter again . #% Some observers even predict that Azerbaijan will eventually see an uprising similar to those that occurred in the toppled regimes of Georgia , Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan . #% Finally , will the Presidency act on a point of principle and condemn such discrimination generally - discrimination which blights the souls of those who practice it as well as those who condone it either by their silence or by their inaction ? #% This is about European citizens and their families being able to move around freely for work and to live ; it is about teenagers getting residence permits in the country in which they have grown up . #% It is contrary to Articles 47 and 48 , of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which you , Madam President , signed . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Prime Minister has told us that we should do whatever needs to be done to stabilise the euro but , in fact , this is only the minimum that is required to be done . #% This resolution charges our Committee on Civil Liberties , as Mr Watson requested on Monday , to follow these developments closely . #% In my own experience when visiting Malta last year , the leading topic for all political parties was the Working Time Directive . #% As we are confronting politicians who promote prejudice , we must also do the same when this is done by the media and our institutions . #% We have the knowledge and experience , for example in the Netherlands , to help improve low-lying land and land susceptible to flooding . #% There is a European dimension to this because , increasingly , not only does food cross boundaries but people cross boundaries . #% I would also like to thank those people within Parliament who helped make this budget a success . #% My main amendment on behalf of my group seeks to insist upon a separate amendment procedure for the second part of the Constitutional Treaty . #% There are measures that need to be taken in terms of employability , training and education for our citizens , but we also need levels of investment improved , both in the public and in the private sectors . #% We must have an agreement . #% This has been a budget procedure which has so far run with remarkable smoothness . #% We want some clarity here , so that we know precisely what we do and do not have access to . #% Therefore , could I ask the Commissioner to make it quite clear on the record that the primary filtration products of these plants would be covered , but that the sludge from sewage treatment would not have to be incinerated and could be spread on the land as before ? #% Britain got a declaration on subsidiarity , an opt-out on the social chapter , thankfully overturned by the Labour victory in 1997 . #% In addition , the parent regulation for the setting of quota entitlements allows only for Member States to exchange quota with other parties . #% 
The line of control between the divided regions of Jammu and Kashmir could eventually be just a line on the map , if people , goods and services could flow freely . #% Therefore , because it is not an easy and simple issue , we have to be cautious and we have to be careful . #% I would like to highlight two points . #% I think it is rather a cruel irony that today the World Food Summit in Rome opens as we are here in the European Parliament contemplating the fact that millions are facing starvation in Central Africa . #% They have not quite stopped the partition and separation by way of identity cards , which my own party leader , Paddy Ashdown - our former representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina - described just last Saturday as racism dressed up as administration . #% The charges against him were trumped up . #% The IGC accepted the same concept of constitutional fidelity that Member States show to the Union , a concept that informed the proceedings throughout the European Convention . #% It is becoming very clear that a lot of Member States that are trying to get rid of the individual opt-out -- which you are working to retain , as I am -- are trying to get around the use of the opt-out , either by using autonomous workers as a way of opting out or by making sure that there are multiple contracts , i.e. two or three contracts for one employee , which makes the whole idea of the Working Time Directive seem ludicrous . #% I am also interested to note that in the United Kingdom debates now seem to have been truncated into times that are well before 10 p.m. . #% Amendment No 26 seeks universally to impose the whole-herd slaughter policy which some Member States with low levels of incidence have introduced in an attempt to reassure the public . #% For practical reasons and for reasons of principle , the right to opt out should remain . #% For the first time the Commission have said that the macroeconomic policy of the European Union must be based upon stimulating internal demand within the fifteen Member States . #% What part of the word ` no ' does Mr Juncker not understand ? #% Aid is essential , as Mr Deva says , for developing countries , but trade will bring benefits on a far greater scale . #% Any individual , citizen , resident or group may petition Parliament if they feel that Community law or principles are not being properly applied at whatever level . #% You can shrug , but it will be interesting to hear your perspective on this . #% Equally , as part of that , we must recognize in Kosovo that we have to guarantee the rights of the Serbs as well as the Albanians , because while fear dominates Kosovo , it will be impossible to find a solution . #% We have just appointed a new Ombudsman . #% As European debates become more idealistic and polarised many people are simply turned off , as evidenced in the recent European elections . #% Additionally , the maintenance of protectionist measures within the EU as a means of shielding EU agricultural producers from external competition is out of step with the EPLP 's position on CAP reform . #% So we accept this as a pragmatic and sensible measure . #% We need to do all of these and we need to do them as speedily as possible . #% I would like to ask that you put to the vote whether or not we vote on de Brémond d'Ars because it is a major issue concerning postal workers in the European Union . #% However , in my view , the amendments that remain are neither necessary nor helpful . #% As others have said , we should be looking at equal rights for people who make such contributions to our societies . #% We need urgent action to supply essential drugs and equipment , to strengthen water-quality control , to support and monitor nutrition programmes , to train health workers and conduct health education programmes . #% Madam President , it is a measure of the ideological poverty of the European Union that anyone can , with a straight face , still talk about success and the CAP in the same sentence . #% I remember very well the budget crisis back in 1998 , when the funding for such NGOs was called into question in a wholly unjustifiable manner . #% In too many places people are still dying simply because of the absence of basic medical facilities that could have saved their lives at very little cost . #% Transparency in this matter , as in others , may help , and we must not let the best be the enemy of the good . #% The Council must renew the sanctions but it should strengthen them , introduce new measures , such as an investment ban , remove exemptions to the travel ban and extend it to include all members of the military junta . #% The EU is already crumbling . #% Undue infringements of our civil liberties make us less secure as individuals . #% Let us improve our constitution by firstly codifying it to make it simple and clear in a single text so that citizens can see how this constitution operates , and secondly by clarifying it in several ways : clarifying the responsibilities , what the Union is and is not responsible for and clarifying the structures . #% We should abandon these grandiose plans and instead support and develop the existing agencies which have a better track record that the EU will ever have . #% A series of amendments then look at a number of technical and administrative matters concerning the composition of the board and Bureau and their respective roles and responsibilities , and the interrelationships between the two bodies . #% Mr President , it is appropriate I raise my point after this exchange because the greatest political excitement in the Brussels village at present is the machinations and intrigues on the fisheries policy , rather than the content of it which is of course very important . #% We need some kind of watchdog to monitor and ensure the implementation of legislation . #% Even in the old chamber when we did not have places allocated , we were at least able to continue to sit in the same places . #% This was a letter posted yesterday by the General Secretary of the Labour Party informing me that I had been suspended from my party . #% So , I found myself wondering on what basis , then , is the pay rate set at which the agency charges the end-user company ? #% This is an important moment for liberalisation of the European economy . #% I am particularly proud of the courage , nerve and clear-sighted vision that have been shown by my party leader and I wish a few more party leaders would do the same . #% Parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool . #% Mr Solana has no legitimacy as the EU 's de facto foreign minister . #% Within the proposals , authorisation periods and tendering are thought to be market-orientated measures that will increase services and competition . #% How many of you know what your responsibilities are under the famous interinstitutional agreement , which was signed in this very Chamber two years ago by our then President , Pat Cox ? #% At any rate it is an area in terms of marine environment that we have to move away from . #% My question to Council and Commission - and since the Council has chosen to negotiate in public - is , why can not we as a European Union avail ourselves of the same instruments that our Member State governments have given to the United Nations ? #% It is that background knowledge , which the Commissioner outlined , that explains why it is so serious that world coffee prices have crashed by more than 60 % in the last decade . #% To turn to the issue of information : this should be a shared responsibility between the institutions and the Member States . #% Paragraph 7 has caused some problems and the wording of Amendment No 1 by Mrs Palacio does not in fact make absolutely clear what she intended , but her explanation this morning in the debate has made it clear that we can support that amendment . #% I am extremely grateful to the Irish presidency for persuading its colleagues in the Council , according to all the accounts I have received , that the offending wording should be deleted so that a rigid hierarchy between bilateral instruments and EU instruments would not be established to the detriment of the latter . #% We need a Dublin Convention that enables asylum-seekers to feel safe and secure , to put their claim for asylum in the first EU country which they reach . #% Mr President , like Sir Neil MacCormick I welcome this report , particularly now it is amended to give it more teeth . #% Only yesterday in this House , Commissioner , I asked you a question about safety standards on camp-sites in Europe . #% It is something we should consider in relation to Solvency II , but it needs more thought and discussion before we can introduce external ratings in this context . #% Therefore , if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro , the ECB must be seen also to embrace greater openness . #% However , the problems of island status , mountainous terrain and sparse population affect many areas in other Member States and in some accession countries too . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Rothley very much , not just for this report but for the sustained campaign that he has run over many years , as the Commissioner indicated , to improve the whole insurance climate for Europe 's motorists . #% There are also particular criteria that we ask the successful candidates to meet : we want to raise the European significance of the sites chosen ; the successful candidates will be expected to organise education events , especially for young people ; there will be an exchange of ideas on initiating common projects with other sites awarded the label ; there will be artistic and cultural activities which will foster dialogue ; and there will be access , of course , for the widest numbers of the public to visit these sites . #% Mr President , I am not sure which report Mr Telkämper is speaking about . #% The decision by the Indonesian authorities to extend martial law and carry out a military crackdown is deeply regrettable , and there has been very heavy-handed military action . #% I wonder if some thought is being given to these issues . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , colleagues , in recommending this resolution to you I want to draw your attention to the views of the people of Europe . #% We would have preferred the Council to have acted decisively , accepted the will of the voters and moved on . #% 
However , the situation is not getting any better . #% I believe that the money markets are not necessarily the best judge of real economic performance , as we have seen with the exchange rate mechanism here in Europe . #% Thirdly , the duties of the President of Parliament are more clearly delineated from those of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% We should support the government to make certain there is democratic control of the military , and reinforce the call made by my colleague , Mrs Gill , for lasting peace . #% Many transactions in banking and stockbrokerage are already taking place online . #% Mr Prodi needs to be supported in his reforms of the Commission . #% I hope it will promote innovation within the industry and give Europe a cutting edge in the world . #% Apart from the understandable security concerns of those involved , the apparent collusion between members of the local police and the British National Party can only cause concern to those who hope that the perpetrators on both sides will be dealt with by a system of justice that is blind to politics . #% Such an extension is uncosted and impracticable -- recreational sports are carried out throughout the year rather than in a bathing season and the number of monitoring points would be huge . #% The Commission needs to address this . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their work in this very important area . #% In spite of the valiant efforts of Mr Vitorino -- whom I salute and will greatly miss -- even he can not work miracles on the Council . #% I appreciate the fact that the honourable Member recognises the limits imposed on the Commission in this instance . #% Even if you have a first-class product , if you do not market it properly it will not sell . #% The Community is set for enlargement in May , bringing under its umbrella another 75 million citizens , while at the same time huge growth is predicted in our major transport networks over the next decade . #% We need amendments in this report to ensure that those cartridges are refilled . #% I simply hope that those in the Union who would seek to generate divisions on the basis of different cultural and linguistic origins will be overwhelmed by the majority who enjoy the diversity and treasure the co-existence of cultures within the same community . #% Now Mr Solana is winning the confidence of the Israelis as well by a more balanced and realistic approach without being too prescriptive . #% I thank you , too , in anticipation of concrete actions to come . #% I know it takes manufacturers many years to design a vehicle to put on the market . #% With the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today , improvements in security must and should be encouraged . #% We now know that Croatia was cooperating very closely with The Hague and providing information which led to the very significant and important arrest of General Gotovina and I congratulate the Presidency on that progress . #% However , Mr Barroso 's reaction was one of denial . #% The Commission will monitor the situation very closely and continue its efforts to impress upon the Indonesian authorities that they should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and , in the meantime , allow independent humanitarian aid providers to operate in Aceh without hindrance . #% I hope - and I am sure the Commissioner is listening - we can make certain that when this system comes into full operation , it is used positively , humanely and with considerable compassion to help and support the most vulnerable in our society . #% There is nothing anti-European in opposing the Constitution . #% So actually the Commission 's proposal would have started in 2010 . #% That would only serve to fuel the sense among our peoples that the EU remains oblivious to their concerns and priorities . #% As Terry Wynn said , we have to ask why America lodged this complaint . #% The EU should respond to Belarus accordingly by stepping up western contacts with pro-democracy parliamentarians who are willing to challenge the regime and are dedicated to making the country a fully-fledged member of the international community , and as such eventually entitled to a partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU . #% Mr President , here we are again . #% Well , many of us have done so . #% Mr Hughes said that the issue is about work/life balance . #% We should strive as far as possible to give all long-term residents the same rights as EU citizens . #% But workers in the UK are on low wages , even though we have a national minimum wage . #% This recommendation does exactly that . #% People want more freedom and more flexibility . #% I know that the Commissioner has a healthy scepticism of my interest in budget quotas , but the 15 % identified in his own programming guidelines should provide a firm baseline in the budget for non-state actor participation - 85 % for governance seems not an unduly small amount . #% They will expect from this House tomorrow a strong vote backing the vote that was carried in the Industry Committee unanimously on Monday of this week . #% If we look at change and coexistence as our goal , then we need to look no further than Northern Ireland where we have brought people together through European funds and dramatically changed the landscape of conflict . #% The European Council should state this intention clearly at the March summit as a key objective of the new strategy . #% There is , however , a problem with the speed of take-up and we agree that social irresponsibility is still out there . #% Everything in that particular story showed where codes of conduct had begun to be discussed and debated . #% I did so 12 years ago when the then Conservative Prime Minister , the then Conservative Government , of which Commissioner Patten was a distinguished Member , committed British troops to repel the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . #% We have here present colleagues with Olympic experience , and I believe that three Member States are bidding to become hosts of the Olympic Games . #% Considering that the Treaty on European Union and now the TFEU obliges EU States to respect the ECHR , this is shameful and unacceptable . #% Under the 2004 EU APIS Directive , governments gave themselves the power to use the personal data for law-enforcement purposes ` in accordance with their national law and subject to the data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/EC ' . #% The regulation is a confidence-building measure . #% I look forward to working with this Parliament , with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples . #% While welcoming the statement by the Council presidency on 18 September 2003 , words are not enough . #% A number of people have referred to this . #% Mr President , the biggest event in the football calendar in Britain is the FA cup final . #% This is regardless of the fact this directive does not apply in the UK . #% I believe Parliament 's resolution to be adopted tomorrow will contribute to this objective . #% The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme , which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years . #% I shall be recommending to my national delegation colleagues that they abstain on the overall vote for a number of reasons including the section of the report concerning ratification of the European Constitutional Treaty . #% We are pleased about the restoration to an appropriate level of that budget line and we hope the Commission will also defend that point of view to the Council . #% Thirdly , and vitally , Member States need to put in place upfront funding for energy-efficiency improvements and , despite all the work of the rapporteur and the shadows ' best efforts , we did not get as far on this in the recast as we would have wished from Parliament 's point of view . #% I think this Parliament should support him in that effort and should talk down those who want to widen the division between our two countries . #% In addition , groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together . #% I was recently in Mauritania and saw how , in a very small hospital in a desert area of that country , health workers were making contact with French doctors in order to have some consultation on diagnoses for patients . #% For that reason , the Socialist Group can not support the report in its entirety . #% It adds no additional military capabilities . #% Give people the freedom to use the Internet to their advantage , to their benefit , for social reasons , for educational reasons , for the disabled - all the benefits the Internet can give us . #% The third point is not contentious . #% Contrary to the Commission 's assertion that most causes of global inequality are unrelated to globalisation , the widening gap between the rich and the poor has developed precisely because unregulated markets and free capital mobility have tended to favour the countries , companies and individuals most able to harness these forces for their own benefit , at the expense of those with fewer resources or less political and economic influence . #% 
It is necessary for textile workers within the EU and those many in other parts of the world who seek to earn their living and improve their own economies and their own lives through the textiles industry . #% The latest member of the ACP is East Timor . #% It is correct that there is a special interest from the general public in such a sensitive area that relates to data protection and exchange . #% We were told that the European Arrest Warrant was about helping to fight terrorism - and we all know it has gone on to be a lot more than that . #% I am grateful that it was relaunched by the Swedish Presidency , but it is only a roadmap on a step-by-step basis . #% So I think I have a role here to speak for the people that I represent and to fight for those jobs which , when things get bad , are very often the first jobs to go . #% That would be irresponsible , and would also be a betrayal of them . #% Flexibility can be provided by the opt-outs from the working week , which are due to be phased out in spite of a vote in this House on 24 February . #% In the light of the ongoing terrorist threat , we believe that clear rules for security and , importantly , common implementation across Europe 's airports and airlines are absolutely necessary , and this proposal delivers on both counts . #% The suspension of a constitution , as mentioned in the resolution , and the constitutional court , has removed a crucial safeguard for him and others like him who fear arbitrary detention . #% Even the Socialist British Government has figured out that this proposal is expensive and dangerous nonsense and it belongs in the bin . #% There is hardly any mention of HIV/AIDS at all , and this has to be a very glaring and serious contradiction in NEPAD 's proposals for action . #% in writing . - Following today 's vote on labelling , consumers will no longer face the risk of mistakenly buying textiles containing real leather or fur . #% They have swallowed whole the arguments of the duty-free industry . #% Amendment 29 in particular will allow areas of the EU that are justifiably proud of the quality of their product to identify it as such . #% In addition , there are several proposals to reduce the weighting on specific subjects from 100 % to 20 % or 50 % or other figures depending on the issue at stake . #% In the case of the UK , it has indicated that it is not going to put any block on the movement of those who wish to come and work in the UK . #% Since 1992 the US has imposed a moratorium on all CITES-listed birds unless it can be scientifically proven that they are harvested in a sustainable way . #% First , dealing with ` systemic risks ' : the international institutions need to be strengthened to face future threats . #% It is important for European consumers and for the European taxpayer . #% Because we can not vote for individual commissioners tomorrow and because I can not individually record my vote in this Chamber that my colleague Mr Patten would make a fine Commissioner for External Affairs , I am left with simply no choice but to vote against this whole Commission in order to send a message to Mr Prodi and his colleagues that if and when they are elected they will respond to this Parliament ; they will accept that it can no longer be business as usual and that we have to change our ways if we are to give the people of Europe the confidence they must have in this Parliament and its institutions . #% Yes , people had rights , but terrorism was unacceptable , there was no such thing as a good terrorist . #% Secondly , in terms of Commission reform , which was also included in this joint declaration back in December 2000 , we wanted to have a range of knowledge about how to achieve the reform . #% Firstly , there has to be maximum transparency , i.e. the Council has to report on what it is doing and allow the European Parliament to comment . #% Yet the EUR 120 million contribution last year is reduced to a proposal of just EUR 35 million for next . #% Evidence proves that somebody who is impaired by tiredness is impaired in the same way as drunkenness . #% The requirement , the objective is for greater security effectiveness with the Europeans and North Americans each contributing more proportionately . #% Perhaps if we can be a bit more progressive and rather more flexible about this , we can have a voluntary arrangement between companies and trade unions which will enable them to enjoy the fruits of worker involvement , however far they want to take that . #% Secondly , any extension of the scope of this proposal to include inland waterways would have caused severe problems not only on the leisure-based inland waterways of the UK but also on many river crossings that provide an essential public service as part of the public transport network . #% We therefore feel that , in this instance , we are not prepared to criticise the Commission for this underspend . #% Containers falling off ships are dangerous . #% How long will it be before there are demands for serious tax harmonisation in Euroland ? #% But what will you do if the UK insists on appointing Peter Mandelson , France Jacques Barrot , Germany Günter Verheugen , and Italy Mario Monti ? #% I think he was betrayed by what has happened in the wake of that , and I do not personally believe that is the way to proceed . #% I also welcome the third point made in Mr Kellett-Bowman 's report , that there will be an input from the substantive committees themselves , because they are best placed to evaluate the work of the agencies as it pertains to their committee . #% Therefore , we need independent inspectors ; we do not need to remove them from the meat and veal sector . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Poisson , for her very clear report on the proposal to amend the Council directive on feedstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes . #% This gene inactivates a number of antibiotics which are extremely important in clinical and veterinary medicine . #% The challenge for your presidency -- and perhaps you could explain to me in your response -- is how you are going to turn the ship around . #% Mr President , I want to make clear my distaste for the complete farce that went on over the release of the OLAF report and the reports on Eurostat . #% This is one of many measures the Commissioner has been proudly associated with to enhance safety at sea . #% We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks . #% But it is concrete results that we want , not just legislation . #% I ask for your clarification . #% This is not a trivial point , it is really important . #% Though not known for being shy in my criticism of this Commission , could I with your permission ask Mrs Sinnott to speak on behalf of our group to give our position ? #% The aims of the directive are clear , and my group is happy to support them in principle . #% My report therefore calls on the Commission to amend its proposal on the revision of Directive 99/32/EC in accordance with the European Parliament 's first reading back in June , the aim of which was to reduce sulphur emissions by 80 % . #% What was the European added value ? #% We must ensure that the accession of these countries to the European Economic Area something people forget about - goes very smoothly , because that has not been the case until now . #% I am also pleased to see that we are to let the markets dictate what technology , if any , should be used . #% Once that is adopted it will provide a clear reference framework for what is in and what is out . #% We have to ensure affordable public services in all these rural areas . #% The first thing I want to say is how warmly I welcome this Parliament resolution . #% It will also cut accident-related congestion by about another EUR 4 billion a year . #% Will he spell out the terms and the timetable on which the proposed transition would be acceptable , including the unimpeded registration of genuine political parties , the release of Chief Abiola and other detainees and international monitoring of elections ? #% I am very much hoping that the Finnish Presidency will give us the right framework within which those decisions will be taken . #% Mr Liikanen made the point about ` serenity ' . #% In conclusion I want to urge the Prime Minister not to be deflected from his stated goals of reform in the Union . #% Mr President , I am very sorry but I am afraid I have to be a little bit churlish as well . #% The problem is that when foreign investment is negotiated via bilateral investment treaties or as proposed by the WTO at Cancún , it can involve exploitation of the weaker partner and the waiving of environmental and social protection . #% These conditions should be applied . #% Mr President , animal testing is carried out on a huge scale across the European Union and the world to ensure that products like chemicals and new medicines and pharmaceuticals are safe for humans to use . #% I have just returned from participating in the electoral observation mission in the Palestine Authority areas and East Jerusalem . #% However , if it did secure a qualified majority , let us not forget that this is the first reading and the question could be resolved in due course . #% I wonder if the President-in-Office believes that the Cardiff Summit will enable women 's employability and women 's employment to gain a higher priority in future years . #% 
Where the Commission has done a good job , we should move ahead and see how far the existing institutions can do it for themselves . #% I will be voting enthusiastically in favour of this report today . #% Mr President , I support the amending budget and am happy to do so . #% Nevertheless I salute him . #% We need to consider whether it has a place in this measure or not . #% I would like to make particular reference to certain aspects of the Commission proposal relating to the agency ' s structure . #% Potentially , there is thus a dual crisis attacking us from both sides . #% Like Mr Mccartney , I went to the Angolan Fishing Ministry and talked to them and they were dreadfully concerned . #% Secondly , it is interesting that in the previous debate we had on this issue of globalisation we recognised , whether we liked it or not , that economic forces were global , new technologies were global . #% This report is a very practical one , putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue . #% Increasing any funding for renewal of fleets or setting prices for fish centrally are particularly distorting and allow for increased use of subsidies . #% Mr President , when my colleague spoke about the Single European Sky in July 2000 he thanked the then rapporteur , Sir Robert Atkins , for providing a gift to the Eurosceptic movement in the United Kingdom . #% We do not , therefore , support movement towards establishment of an EU diplomatic service or the `` communitarisation '' of foreign policy ; the extension of Europol competence into operational areas ; or measures that will lead to the development of a European Army . #% Milosevic is not adhering to Resolution 1199 . #% Indeed , for a time , I was minister responsible for Aerospace and therefore for Airbus , so I am one of those who is very keen that the A400M flies as soon as possible . #% Will the Court of Auditors make sure that the Commission fully understands the criticisms of the existing regime and point out to the Commission that they are only in a position to take the moral high ground if they stop the support for the regime ? #% Everyone will recall that the common policy for safe seas called for the measure that , I am glad to say , Mr Kinnock has now brought before this Parliament . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I made a full statement about this last night . #% Those 63 , the petitioners to this Parliament , and thousands of other names from many European countries have one simple question , the question put in our resolution of last September and reiterated today : did the United Kingdom , between 1978 and 2001 implement , fully and correctly , Directive 73/239/EEC relating to Lloyd 's ? #% However , as the reports before us today show , and as the Commission has indicated in its composite paper and regular reports , not all applicant countries are proceeding at the same speed towards meeting the criteria for membership . #% Mention has already been made of the short timescale for the trade preference relaxation , reduced from three years to one year : Pakistan is prevented from maintaining or increasing duties or charges within that time . #% Furthermore , there is , it seems to me , within the agreement some considerable disregard for the expanding needs of the artisanal fishing fleet and warnings about the decline in fishing stocks . #% Mr President , Kyrgyzstan is a small , central Asian Muslim republic of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions . #% Announcement of the result of the election of the Ombudsman #% The biggest disgrace of the common foreign and security policy is what happened in Mostar , and what happened to Mr Koschnick , who was our administrator in Mostar . #% Mr President , 25 Member States are about to sign and then embark on their ratification procedures . #% These address a number of areas , including the complementary risk-assessments for surfactants that fail the ultimate biodegradability tests , so that a tiered approach can take into account exposure and risk . #% I hope that we will achieve them , but I sound a warning note . #% The House would do well to await the results of any official investigations before jumping to conclusions that can often be misguided and wrong . #% I am tiring of the Commission 's response to the effect that ` it is nothing to do with us ' . #% Mr President , I support the extension of the Lamfalussy procedure in principle and I hope the interinstitutional difficulties can be resolved as soon as possible , so we can move forward and modernise decision-making structures in relation to banking , insurance and financial conglomerates . #% Of course , if young children are at risk then it is right to take action to remove that risk . #% We must give them our wholehearted support . #% Commissioner , the English translation of the question refers not to ` less-favoured agricultural areas ' but to ` highly depressed agricultural areas ' . #% If I recall correctly , some of the refugees were actually killed . #% It is beyond the competence of the EU to dictate educational reforms to Member States , and we must ensure that this is respected . #% I should like to read from the letter that Mrs Ferrero-Waldner sent last Friday to the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Mr Brok : ` This provision may also include working with democratic political partners in third countries , provided that the principle of impartiality towards such partners is respected . #% I am interested to see that this is a tremendous preoccupation of colleagues on the other side of the House . #% Now the Commission has confirmed that suspicion with its announcement on Monday that France , Belgium and Germany , those great EU enthusiasts , are bottom of the league for implementing internal market rules , and France tops the list of infringement cases . #% If the Commissioner doubts that figure , he can come to see me any time he likes ; I have the figures from the people working in the sector . #% Nonetheless , I would invite the Council to become familiar with this outrage that took place last year . #% Obviously technology could be developed further , but it would require the use of catalytic converter technology , which is extremely difficult in a marine environment . #% Mr President , I wish to talk about one or two aspects with respect to North Korea . #% As the Commissioner said , I have taken a lot from Directive 91/414/EEC , which covers plant protection products , and I wish to add to that . #% This debate does raise a very important question of what we feel is a very dangerous emerging democratic deficit in the new global world order which , to some extent , this transatlantic dialogue can offset . #% We have to consider this essentially a transitional piece of work . #% A staggering 87 % of the UK population would rather buy from companies that do something positive for the community . #% I abstained when this report came to the committee because I believe it does not achieve the fair and correct balance that is necessary . #% There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : `` It has not been done before '' . #% That is the only way we are going to achieve peace in the Middle East . #% Many of the achievements of Barcelona are , of course , welcome , and I join with those who have been recognising the enormous efforts of the Spanish presidency and the European Commission in pushing forward those achievements . #% I would also like to stress the committee ' s view that the ECB should bring pressure to bear on those Member States which rely excessively on short-term debt , as this can present dangers , particularly during a financial crisis . #% The creation of a policy planning and early warning unit and the office of the High Representative , outlined in the Amsterdam Treaty , and already mentioned this afternoon will help improve the visibility of the CSFP . #% Some of those substances , for example PVC , might be better dealt with by priority waste stream projects that could emphasize recycling as the main strategy . #% Peace can not be achieved without justice and it is justice for the individual -- the men , women and children living this conflict on a daily basis -- which is the key to lasting peace . #% For all these reasons , we voted against the resolution . #% In some parts of the Union - and I am quite willing to cite the United Kingdom - we are not doing as well as we could . #% Extreme poverty has increased from 25 % to nearly 50 % in the last 15 years and the external debt absorbs 20 to 30 % of all foreign earnings . #% Mr President , could I have an assurance that both Commissioners are united in opposition to the import of beef produced with hormones and also milk produced with BST . #% He has managed to incorporate most of the legislation that went through the Committee on the Environment , which is important . #% It also looks at the cruelty of beak trimming and only allows it when other measures to prevent cannibalism are exhausted . #% On arrival the wines are specially packed to meet the needs of the particular markets . #% The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech . #% I look down the list of people who actually serve on this committee and in this Parliament and I do not see a great deal of experience there , so it is a question of the blind leading the blind . #% My questions to the Commission - and I know he will answer them in his usual genial way - really relate to how this funding package will work . #% Could the Commissioner tell us , firstly , what we now know about the incubation period in the bird population , and whether there is any sign that the virus has spread to other species ? #% 
From the outset we should be in support of this round , we should have a positive outlook to ensure that we can avoid protectionism , promote free trade and extend prosperity in the world system to other parts of the world . #% With the erosion of the WTO system , speculation is rife about what form a ` Plan B ' might take : perhaps and East Asia free trade area ; perhaps Japan 's proposal for a pan-Asian comprehensive economic partnership that includes India , Australia and New Zealand . #% We have room for conciliation and the advantage , if we adopt these amendments tomorrow , is that Parliament would be openly engaged in the final form of this proposal , which otherwise we will not be . #% It is still not sufficient and I would like to draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that in the Convention there are proposals being floated to involve national parliaments in this debate in future . #% The fact remains that it is not feasible to have a legal call-back within the terms of the Treaty . #% Israel was singled out by countries and organisations which have an appalling record on human rights . #% Sadly we here in Parliament will be witnessing it from the sidelines . #% We all appreciate the importance of your task in the competition department of the Commission . #% However , as the years have gone by , they have got deeper into the mire of illegality . #% In this regard it is pertinent to mention Mr Wolf 's reference to the UK 's Bank of England where , under the new Labour Government , the bank 's independence and public accountability have both been strengthened . #% When we were in Edinburgh , the Eritrean Ambassador to the EU told me that Eritrea wanted the situation resolved , but Ethiopia was refusing to take action . #% In particular we should not prejudge the market at this stage . #% But , where they go beyond that , it is the consumer who is most disadvantaged . #% It should have been two separate reports but owing to Parliament 's Rules , and also to time restraints and organisational factors , it is a single report . #% It is a pity that it could not have been far more explicit in that statement . #% It gives consumers the possibility of obtaining an injunction for an infringement of certain Community directives . #% However , because of the European Arrest Warrant one of the suspects was brought back to the United Kingdom from Italy in a matter of weeks . #% With this rule change , that will be possible ; we will , of course - that is the compromise - still put the report to the chamber to give a yes or no to it . #% But we must not forget the historical context in which we find ourselves today . #% I urge the Minister to persuade interior ministries and home offices to change the habits of a lifetime and be open , candid and accountable in their dealings . #% Should we come back for a fourth package ? #% We need to have some way of dealing with the misleading claims which are made , which balance one substance against another , and only tell you about the one for which the claim could be made . #% From our own perspective there are areas where we are unclear on how things will be funded . #% Mr President , I just want to raise a small housekeeping point . #% It will be a disgrace if the European arrest warrant is agreed this weekend and this situation has still not been resolved . #% Allow nations to set their own rules over everything that is not directly concerned with trade or other matters of common interest . #% Latvia has to make serious advances in the reform of its judicial system and in dealing with corruption . #% So , I strongly commend Amendment No 2 , which has already been carried by the Committee on Budgets , to the House . #% Businesses are leaving every day and moving to Switzerland and Bermuda and the same thing will happen with the services directive . #% -- Mr President , Parliament has consistently campaigned against illegal internment in Guantanamo Bay . #% The projected growth of air traffic demands is clearly an issue that requires action now . #% That is not clear in our present Rules , but it should be . #% I recognise the fact that there are many rare diseases that are orphaned from research as medical institutes engage in a form of triage , ignoring the plight of those suffering from unusual diseases that offer little in the way of profits compared to those potentially available from common diseases . #% Just for the record , I wish to make it clear that my delegation has taken no position on this matter in the EPP Group . #% That has now being reversed by the Council of Ministers . #% What better time to be doing that than now , when the whole world it seems is consumed by football ? #% In an increasingly knowledge-based society , the Internet is a major tool of empowerment for the people of the North West , Britain and Europe as a whole , whether in the marketplace or the workplace . #% -- Mr President , yes , that related to the recitals . #% The programme of the Belgian presidency is ambitious . #% Mrs De Keyser talked of the hope for an incipient restoration of normal relations . #% I will mention public health budget line B3-4301 on combating cancer . #% I suggest an alternative solution based on the repeated statements that we are supposed to be in an EU which retains its individual Member State status . #% I want a representative of Her Majesty 's Government who not only knows my country but cares for it too . #% Naturally , the Commission remains in daily contact with its delegation in Colombo in order to keep abreast of all developments . #% Mr President , the Liberal Group suspects that the government of Israel is applying the origin rules of the Association Agreement in a way that derives from its settlement policies . #% The Action Plan does not , however , specify that an external legal expert should sit on the board . #% Mr President , you would be hard pressed to discover from the Commission website that there was a problem in the Maldives . #% They have become capital collateral on airlines ' financial books and our rapporteur is right when he states that this aspect needs to be revisited in the future . #% His response was to claim that he had found a once-and-for-all agreement . #% The Commission worked very hard to get document integrity , law enforcement and border controls up to scratch . #% The Council , as well as MEPs , must welcome proposals that the Commission is preparing on achieving equivalence in criminal justice standards . #% Mr President , I am sorry to have lost the opportunity to bend Madam President ' s ear . #% Could you tell me how long you anticipate that process continuing ? #% We can , however , aim to ensure that the regulation is as clear and comprehensive as possible so that employers can not side-step their obligations to their employees and ask them , for example , to become self-employed to avoid payment of social security . #% We , as a Parliament - and the other authorities charged with monitoring budgetary expenditure - have a problem in that we can not adequately monitor expenditure to ensure value for money . #% One of the sad things about the press reports of the summit meeting that was held in Vienna was the fact that it did not pick up the enormous progress that has been made during the Austrian presidency in tackling unemployment . #% Nevertheless , it remains a one-party communist dictatorship , sharing little in the way of common values with the EU , unlike India , which shares the West 's respect for democracy and human rights . #% The bottlers have an interest in ensuring that they are seen to be selling quality wines . #% That will be very important while the enlargement negotiations are going on in parallel . #% There is now a degree of security in Afghanistan . #% When the chairman of the scientific committee came to us he most certainly did not convey to us any sense of the urgent need for action . #% What do you expect to be the outcome of the political dialogue on 4 November , which you have described ? #% In turn , those practitioners seek the rights of movement enshrined in the treaties . #% We ask that these neighbouring states act with discretion . #% Madam President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on producing his timely report . #% Secondly , let me say to my Polish friends that this is not an issue which is getting at Poland . #% 
That is why I have tabled an amendment on the report on the euro and tourism to highlight that to the Commission and the Council of Ministers . #% The ELDR firmly believes that there is an urgent need to regulate this fishery . #% The second is the provision for the technical requirements to be extended in future through a regulatory committee procedure to introduce new standards for fuel tanks containing gaseous fuels . #% It is unfortunate , that there is no single data protection instrument for all the pillars . #% It is important that we act internationally , and not unilaterally , through the International Maritime Organisation and Marpol Annex VI . #% The original Brejc report addressed the subject sensitively and sensibly . #% The development of an efficient computerised system is also essential to fulfilling this task . #% We know where funding is needed far better than the bureaucrats in Brussels . #% Suspension of any agreement is a last resort and is therefore very rarely used . #% If you are going to be fair Mr President , let me say I express total satisfaction with the reply of the Commission . #% We do not trust each other , and therefore there is no cooperation . #% At present food labelling is at best vague , at worst deliberately misleading . #% We believe that the monies will be needed for 2004 . #% I want to congratulate Mr Papayannakis on his patience over the last few weeks . #% The European Parliament should say so in the coming weeks as the committees look into this programme . #% That is my speech . #% With elections in Zimbabwe just five weeks away , simply renewing existing EU sanctions does not send a clear message to the regime that it must change for the better or face the consequences . #% This , in my view , will also generate some serious conflicts of interest were Turkey one day to join the European Union . #% However , responsible countries such as the United Kingdom and other EU Member States will only achieve a hollow moral victory if other less conscientious nations rush to fill the gap in arms sales left by our absence . #% Could I , on behalf of my group , assure the Commissioner that these proposals are welcome and just ask him a couple of questions about them : firstly , could he say more about the consultation programme regarding the candidate countries ? #% But it will also reveal the differences in indirect taxation , value added tax in particular . #% We must counter that . #% Why can we not do the same ? #% One question we need answering before we take a decision next week on category 4 is : what is the amount of money that the European Union has to pay to get a seat on the board of the Global Health Fund ? #% Contrary to some popular conception in the UK , farmers in Yorkshire are certainly not whingers . #% Since the matter has been raised in the public arena , could I place on record the reason for the Quaestors ' recommendation ? #% We have to ask ourselves is someone or an organisation that is helping people in desperate circumstances escape persecution a criminal ? #% This is the important backdrop to our debate today on the Bilbao Agency . #% I have just announced our intention under the programme to present a communication on the issues you have referred to as part of our contribution to next year 's United Nations Year . #% What they really want is access , in the first place , or a choice through which they actually have some sort of access . #% I did this because my party at home simply did not believe that taxpayers ' money was being spent properly or accounted for properly . #% The third thing of importance is to ensure a reasonable return on investment . #% The development of an efficient computerised system will also make it possible to report in greater detail to the public on the action taken by the Commission to monitor application of Community law whenever a decision has been taken to issue a reasoned opinion or to refer a case to the court . #% Disqualifications should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation . #% If we want to abrogate our support of the one-China policy we followed in the past , we should do so directly , rather than by hiding it within paragraph 35 on the WHO . #% Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control . #% Clearly there are many in this House who are quite open in their advocacy of a single foreign ministry for Europe and the Galeote Quecedo report which was voted on today with its proposals for a permanent Community diplomatic service is , I am afraid , a step in this direction . #% Firstly , we want the Commission to state here that there will be a framework directive on food and to tell us what the timetable for that directive would be . #% So where would we lose out if companies decided that they were not going to bother to use this directive ? #% The EU is not here to create social engineering with its policies . #% It is in all our interests to make real and lasting progress . #% I think we still have problems for the entertainment and leisure industry but the rest of industry and the workers will find this directive very easy to live with . #% Now we have to decide whether the Commission has performed sufficiently well on these five points to merit discharge . #% Joint structures which we could develop with institutions in Brussels , perhaps under the European Convention , will assist in greater coordination . #% Thus her funeral shamefully could not take place in Italy as they would not be permitted to attend . #% I congratulate the last French Presidency on its plans for tough penalties across the EU on carriers illegally transporting third-country nationals into Member States . #% It is very nice to see her here for what must be one of her last debates as Environment Commissioner . #% There are many others , not just the existing green organizations which are accessing this funding now , which could in future usefully benefit from the source of funding of this kind , to bring environmental issues to the attention not simply of legislators in Brussels but also within the regions and within the localities of Europe and to address more local issues and ensure that justice is done through the courts . #% My apologies also to Baroness Ludford . #% All such tests will be banned within the six years with the exception of the three to which the rapporteur has drawn attention , for which there will be a ten-year permitted timetable and a possibility of an extension of two years if , and only if , this Parliament endorses that extension through codecision . #% In my view , the Commission has a final chance to prove itself the clean , efficient and effective executive that the European Union needs and that its citizens deserve . #% Madam President , I will be very brief by answering just the third question that related to the recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts . #% The United Kingdom has already banned animal testing . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , apparently , a small German company , BronchoAir of Munich , has produced an inhaler which can actually improve the life of asthma sufferers who rely on such devices to breathe . #% The governments of both those countries should have reinforced and not withdrawn their garrisons . #% I have to say that the proposals we have seen so far from the Commission on regulatory assessment are far too timid . #% Secondly , economic concerns . #% But for the rapid action of the United Kingdom Government to ban exports and impose movement restrictions and alert other Member States , the impact on the Continent and in Britain would have been far greater . #% If this is not allowed , then it tells us that the Treaty is not working , and that is why it needs review and attention . #% Mr President , Iran is a great country with a glorious past . #% My second point concerns equal treatment . #% As has been said , this becomes crucial as we look towards enlargement . #% I welcome the fact that Article 366 of the Lomé Convention has been invoked . #% If you were a democrat and not an EU nationalist , you would put a case for free and fair open referendums , so that the peoples of Europe could express their will . #% I shall certainly vote against this report tomorrow in plenary . #% It is a curious feature of the construction of Europe that more opportunities for cross-border cooperation have been taken by commerce and criminals than by civil servants , and it is about time our national public administrations made a real effort to get out of their bunkers . #% 
With great difficulty , unless we make some radical changes . #% I wonder whether you could put that request to it at some stage this week . #% Go and talk to small businessmen . #% Last week I said publicly to you , President Barroso , that I thought you were wobbling over this proposal . #% I felt the devastation in Carlisle as deeply as I felt the aftermath of the tsunami and the earthquake in South Asia some months later . #% It has done it , and I say to the President-in-Office in a colloquial term , ' you have played a blinder ' in doing that . #% Anwar Ibrahim 's black eye on arrest is a reproach to the rule of law in Malaysia and to all of us who cherish the primacy of human rights in the conduct of human affairs . #% Mr President , we have heard from Commissioner Monti that the decision to extend the Common Transit Convention to the Visegrad countries was taken by the EC/EFTA Joint Committee in 1996 in Interlaken . #% What percentage of that income is then paid to the worker ? #% As the European Union 's representative in Cambodia I was very well aware of how difficult that phraseology was . #% It has already flooded on the ground floor during construction . #% It is precisely for this reason that at this critical juncture of the ongoing power struggle , the EU must maintain open supportive dialogue with both the government and the reformists , and in particular with the modernisers within the government . #% If political and democratic openness and acceptability matter - and no political group in this House believes in them more than we in the PPE-DE Group do - the Napolitano report represents an important starting point . #% Besides , profits are essential to fund further innovative research and development in the future , even into orphan drugs for rare tropical illnesses , which are of little interest in the West at present . #% I will be , perhaps , slightly less francophile this afternoon when I remind Members that in England we have a saying : the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton . #% You will notice that I said ` when the Lisbon Treaty is implemented ' and not ` if ' . #% It is necessary to bring the sugar regime into line with CAP reforms , and we must abandon C quota , which I believe will be ruled illegal by the WTO . #% I welcome much that is positive in the new proposals and the Krahmer report , such as the streamlining of the law , greater public accessibility to monitoring results , new limits for fine particulates and stricter ones for other pollutants . #% She has no visitors ; her phone line has been cut ; she lives behind a wall of sandbags and barbed wire , patrolled continuously by armed guards and soldiers . #% I am sure that that requirement is well understood and supported across this House . #% We recognise that Mr Barroso has the qualities needed to fulfil his duties and that he broadly shares our views on the Lisbon Strategy and on transatlantic relations and we also recognise that his Commission , on balance , shares his approach . #% Mr President , it is good to see you , the faithful Friday President , taking charge of affairs at the close of the session . #% Frankly , this makes the European Union the most democratic international structure , or supranational structure , that exists in the world . #% That then resulted in animals having to travel very large distances to slaughterhouses . #% Well , it knows the facts and we do not , so we can not comment at this moment on that . #% In my brief but eventful career as an MEP , and particularly after yesterday , I have noted a willingness of this Assembly which dares to call itself a `` parliament '' to act as a rubber stamp for the Commission and again I sense that this is our role . #% If the terrible events of 22 December jolt those in a position of responsibility to take the actions required , not only to resolve the conflict , but also to tackle the underlying problems of poverty , deprivation and discrimination which lie behind the Zapatista revolt , the victims of Acteal will not have died in vain . #% To put it simply , a ship fitted with a black box is a safer ship . #% In addition , where subjects which , in the ordinary Council , would be taken by a qualified majority , go to the European Council , they should similarly be dealt with by a qualified majority in the European Council . #% It stumbled in its first few days in office . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Pery on her report . #% The objective , as the President of the Court has suggested , must be the introduction of the principle of making Member States responsible for this expenditure . #% That would be a form of cultural imperialism . #% Last year , the legislation finally came through on that basis , in accordance with the will of all our Member States and of all our national parliaments . #% That is why I think it is right that we make a political commitment , at the highest level , on behalf of and with children . #% Amendment No 1 does this by specifying that Member States , in accordance with their normal tradition and practice , will consult with both sides of industry and lay down practical guidelines for determining work of this kind . #% Mr President , what we are talking about here is not simply settling a dispute between Israel and the Palestinians . #% What are we going to do about the risk of that ? #% However , the economic and social importance of tobacco in certain regions must be taken into account . #% The idea of ` one country , two systems ' appears to work . #% They are on duty in Aceh . #% Given the important role of public procurement in promoting and supporting new technologies , I supported this report . #% The Cotonou Partnership Agreement emphasises very clearly the importance of the Assembly , but omits to award enough importance , if any at all , to the role of national parliaments in our cooperation . #% Secondly , as other speakers have made clear , we have direct responsibility as the trade negotiations start with our ACP colleagues . #% I am sure to a lot of people it seems quite comical but it is an extremely serious issue . #% I welcome this effort to update solvency margin requirements : the rules relating to the capital buffer that insurance companies are required to hold against unforeseen contingencies , particularly high claims and poor investment performance . #% It is for that reason we shall support it as long as Mr Lehne 's proposals are not amended or watered down . #% We will maintain price stability and we will maintain budget deficits within containable levels and I hope a balanced budget over the economic cycle . #% As a democratic nation , we believe this matter should be decided by the Lithuanian parliament and the Lithuanian people . #% We were summoned here to vote , originally at 12.00 , then at 12.15 and now here we are voting at nearly 12.40 . #% One of the speakers was a young man called Michael , a 29-year-old who had been put in one of these caged beds for a week , unable to get out . #% Madam President , I wish to add my warm welcome and congratulations to the presidency on the successful achievement of the Lisbon Summit . #% Having had experience of working in this field in the 1990s with the ex-Soviet Union , through an external agency which had an agility and freedom to manoeuvre not enjoyed by the Commission and the deniability not available to the Council , I can say that , with the advantage of Parliament 's involvement , we have a much more effective programme . #% We must be consistent in the application of principle . #% I hope that the Commission will ensure that such anti-competitive practices are not allowed to occur in future . #% In conclusion , I would like to say that establishing and developing agencies is not a one-year job . #% For men and women , our message is that we have a united resolution and we demand united action from the Commission . #% I would very much like to see the proposal being extended to cover those . #% Would you agree with me that this tragedy , whilst clearly on British soil -- or in British waters -- is equally a European or international issue , and that we must work together to counter the international people-smuggling gangs that were exploiting these poor people who were being paid as little as one pound per day for their work ? #% In my judgement , this should inspire India to assume greater moral leadership in the subcontinent and this means working not just with Pakistan , but with all stakeholders to ensure that human rights abuses are resolved with urgency . #% Key issues included the declaration of performance or CE marking , where a successful agreement was made to ensure micro-enterprises do not face the same burdens as larger companies . #% The industry has communicated to us that it may take four years to produce an effective stockpile of everything we need to deal with the virus if it mutates in the way that is predicted . #% This attempted reversal of the relationship between the State and the individual has been foisted on us over the last 30 years by deceit , denial and misrepresentation . #% The Development , Trade , Budgets , Consumers and the Environment Committees are all concerned by this complex issue . #% After some discussion with both the Commission and the Council , I have proposed a compromise of EUR 21 million , remembering that this figure will be adjusted in the event of enlargement . #% There seems to me no reason why that process should not start at once , and also why communications to affected organisations should not also start . #% 
I will remind the House that the successful slogan for the Irish ` No ' campagin was ` If you do n't know , vote no . ' #% They have let the people of Galicia and all of us down on this issue of maritime safety . #% Finally , my colleague , Mr Schröder , has already made it quite clear that it was necessary to enable Commissioner Michel last week to answer on the record the questions raised with him , and that process has been completed . #% This House rightly rejects discrimination in all its forms and we receive opinions on this subject from many quarters , including the Economic and Social Committee . #% That is the reason why we have not come up with a proposal on OLAF . #% It has to be proven that such disclosure would undermine the institution 's ability to function . #% Here is the said bottle of champagne . #% on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I am speaking tonight because my colleague , Mr Bufton , who would have addressed you , is unwell . #% I even submitted a draft of a possible alternative . #% Why must we do that ? #% It is particularly important , finally , that consumers know where the beef they are consuming comes from . #% - Mr President , on behalf of the Environment Committee , I would like to add a few final words before the Commissioner sums up . #% So much for European democracy . #% We in the European Parliament -- and I in particular , as the rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy -- will all be closely monitoring this process . #% What it would seem to me you are suggesting is that as long as all the candidates can get one vote , which means they can vote for themselves , they are bound to be elected . #% Fourteen years of violence and misrule in Liberia resulted in immense human suffering amongst civilians , as well as gross human rights violations , a breakdown in social and economic structures , and now 85 % of the population is living below the poverty line . #% However , we agree that it makes no sense to exclude projects financed wholly or partially by the European Union , especially structural funds , and we certainly agree that it makes sense to talk to neighbouring states outside the European Union . #% Perhaps even more important today , can I also thank the Commissioner and his services because we in the Socialist Group have long been calling for a better type of annual economic report from the Commission which addresses the real problems facing our citizens . #% Clearly we have here a vehicle which could make European products truly pan-European , where a European quality label could become just as reassuring as the British Standards Institution marks which we enjoy in the UK . #% As a Member of the European Parliamentary Labour Party ( EPLP ) I will vote against this report . #% We would also like to know what kinds of expenditure the Council is expecting over the next five years , because we also agree with the rapporteur that it is unhealthy to think that the Council is going to be involved in large expenditure of funds which would not be subject to normal accountability and use . #% Training and education are essential ways in which EU Member States can jointly boost the EU 's employment rate . #% What we need to know is whether the Commission is determined to get as good a result as it can . #% Furthermore , Parliament was dissatisfied with the speed at which the risk assessment was being carried out , as this was delaying any real concrete decisions . #% This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382 . #% We know that in state trials black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than white defendants . #% As a number of colleagues have said tonight , the world of electronic communications is offering immense benefits to the citizens , whether it is in their own personal access to charities or political parties or in the marketplace . #% We would have much preferred that the Oostlander report waited until after that hearing or , indeed , that the hearing be brought forward . #% I would like some clarification from the Commissioner on whether the precedent set by the Japanese agreement of 15 months ago on compliance is one which the Commission will be sticking to . #% It is a pity that the Council appears to have already made up its mind before listening to the views of Parliament , and that once again we are running to catch up with the process . #% For its part , the EU must press on with its reforms to lay the groundwork for enlargement . #% We are therefore using an intelligence-led approach which relies on public confidence and support to be effective . #% Could I make a plea that when this regulation comes into place the many loopholes which still remain in the regulation and which would allow a continued proliferation of small and excessively multiplied projects are closed and that a real , and perhaps in some cases ruthless , concentration of implementing projects is enforced . #% In one recent case , beef over 30 months from a plant in Cork was shipped illegally for processing and then resale within the UK . #% Colleagues , it is normal when considering issues like this to look to the future . #% Let me analyse this . #% I am sorry , but we are living in a global economy . #% I also fully support cooperation between law-enforcement , judicial and intelligence services and agencies , not just within the EU , but globally with allies such as the USA , and with other powers such as Russia and China which have their own domestic Islamist problems in Chechnya and with Uighur minority and terrorists who are connected to Al Qaeda . #% One of the paragraphs in our resolution opposes the use of the EDF B envelope to support those countries in East Africa . #% Several times in the last week you have talked about the 21st century , you have talked about the need to modernise . #% The journal that the Commission publishes on IDABC often mentions the IDABC way and it is important to emphasise that the IDABC way is about eMethodology : not only about the projects , but looking at the way in which those projects are developed . #% In fact , although this is designed to protect the few consumers who have allergies to certain fragrances , the proposal is unlikely to provide a significant public health benefit . #% A Community of action that will seek to develop a peace initiative in the Middle East ; a Community of action that will search for global security in the fight against international terrorism , cooperation in development assistance and in facing the new global challenges of the disasters in the Middle East which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned . #% Loss of the derogation will put a hobby and an industry at great risk . #% Not only do we share a common cultural heritage and fundamental Western values on democracy , human rights and the rule of law -- as well as having a small piece of EU territory there in the form of French Guiana . #% Not only that , but each and every aspect of this report duly sets out another attempt to interfere with commercial activity . #% Mr President , I asked the President-in-Office to answer my question whether Article 7 of the Treaties actually asks the Fourteen to take action in respect of a country whose human rights record is called into question . #% People in Europe want action ; they want action on growth and they want action on jobs . #% This is very important and we must not do anything to undermine the cohesion of the Contact Group . #% The global approach of the Commission is , therefore , to be welcomed . #% There are many examples of what happens to fixed exchange rate regimes when governments do not keep their budgets in order . #% Let us be honest : we want them to help maintain our standard of living . #% Answer : more regulations and red tape for businesses , falling most heavily on the SMEs who , between them , employ half the workforce . #% I would like to outline some of the areas which we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs felt were very important . #% So the perception that many have that the Arab world is not ready for democracy is undermined by the United Nations ' own reports . #% I should also like to thank the President-in-Office . #% Finally , it set an example as to how presidencies should deal with Parliament , with a record number of ministerial appearances , including no fewer than four by Prime Minister Blair himself . #% It is a good thing , a positive and timely development . #% We all agreed we wanted , for example , to exempt the professional market for Eurobonds from the requirement for a prospectus , but of course , to insist on one if the issuer wanted to attract retail investors . #% I begin by saying that the Commission does not agree with the report 's conclusions that the growing volume of infringements handled by the Commission departments , in particular on the basis of complaints , reflects a deterioration in the application of Community law . #% It was like the question addressed to Mr Karas just now by the Earl of Dartmouth . #% We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible . #% Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk . #% We are certainly right to regret the military take-over but it would be sensible to recognise that the new military regime is so far extremely popular within Pakistan . #% It is not the direction a Union committed to transforming itself into the most dynamic , knowledge-based economy in the world should even think of taking . #% There are , however , many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that should n't be supported , and I 'm thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example . #% 
Mr President , my thanks to Mr Gargani for bringing forward this report and to Members of the previous Parliament who also put some work into ensuring that it comes before us tonight . #% That is a controversial paragraph but we have also reached a very successful conclusion in that . #% Our Presidency has sought to use the six months since June to build on the broad range of existing EU commitments . #% It is extraordinary to suggest that the financial regulators , the most criticised public institutions in most Member States - they always get the blame when banks fail - should help determine whether information has been fairly presented . #% Many people in my constituency see the huge sums wasted on this and other agencies as a kick in the teeth , especially at a time of economic crisis when they are giving up increasing amounts of their money in tax to fund the EU 's profligacy . #% This is a country that over the last 12 to 18 months has engaged in massive and irreversible steps on the road to economic reform , in particular in industry and agriculture . #% Since the bulldozers moved in it has become impossible to move around the field without treading on fragments of human bones and remains , shreds of military uniform and military equipment . #% It is about intensive production and this does not always take place on the large farms . #% He was told that he could no longer serve underdone beef because Brussels had forbidden the serving of underdone beef . #% Many targets set as part of Europe 2020 will be reviewed at the June meeting . #% For those of us who like beef on the bone , what is the justification ? #% Could you foresee the inclusion of such a provision in your proposals ? #% As Commissioner Barrot has said , some states are delaying , but without confidence you could hardly blame them . #% It can not come to us and say this is what the European Union 's programme is going to be and expect us simply to accept everything that is in its documents . #% They have lost their place , the people , the fish , the animals , the water , the land , their homes , their farms , villages , towns , boats and agriculture through killing , burning and draining . #% Are the testing methods available , and what about the supermarkets claims ? #% However , the delegation maintains its opposition to the wording ` political integration ' referred to in Amendment 3 to Recital 1a ( new ) , as this implies a constitutional settlement in the EU , which does not reflect the current position and which has not received the assent of the 25 Member States . #% There is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged . #% The Commission estimates that for every euro spent on IT infrastructure , the public sector can gain up to EUR 1.8 . #% While the British Conservative Delegation are determined to play a full part in the fight against terrorism and fully support enhanced cooperation between the police and other law enforcement organisations in the various Member States , we can not support moves towards the extension of Eurojust . #% I ask you : what sort of relationship with what sort of Europe is right for our people and our nations in this first half of the 21st century ? #% This is a scourge that we must defeat across the whole of Europe . #% Others believe that Amendment No 141 should be supported wholeheartedly as it would help reduce the net payments of their Member States and if I were German or Dutch , I would wholeheartedly support this new paragraph 13 . #% There can be no question of admitting countries that can not or will not enforce the aquis in this area , particularly in relation to state aids , competition policy and respect for intellectual property . #% It is clear that additional resources will be needed to cope with the effects of change ushered in by EPAs . #% It seems that the devastatingly brilliant third way that you introduced into British politics is what you are going to bring in during this presidency here . #% Now , of course , we know , regrettably , that it is all too common in Turkey for the police and the military to murder its citizens . #% Our reforms must continue to use the common policy as a social tool . #% It is essential for the Council to understand that in Parliament we have consensus and are determined on that point , whatever the differences that might appear elsewhere about the right strategy . #% Having listened to those who sell car insurance over the telephone , Amendment No 38 takes into account the fact that such a transaction must take place before the formal exchange of the durable contract . #% The text would not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of the Swedish Presidency . #% Will this be done by Europol or will it be done by the Commission -- or maybe a new agency ? #% Coordination of the plot , getting the story right , seems to me to be extremely important . #% Peter Skinner said that I had apparently complained to the British press that people were being told they needed to be trained to go up ladders , but the only reference to training was alleged to be an amendment from me . #% By listing environmental crimes and a corresponding list of sanctions , the Commission draft directive provides a concrete means by which Member States will be able to enforce environmental law in symmetry , since at present , EU environmental policy is implemented in an ad hoc and asymmetric fashion . #% Secondly , overall within the European Union we will enhance industrial competitiveness if we make short sea shipping in Europe more competitive . #% However , I do understand that there are some queries about the question of the suitability of the Charleroi stadium and its ability to safely host the England versus Germany game on 17 June . #% That clearly will not happen , but we do need some reassurance , because they feel that the Commission is letting them down on this point . #% The Commission has to press Member States to come forward with them as quickly as possible . #% My final point is addressed again to Commissioner Wallström , and concerns communication , which is her brief . #% on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - Madam President , congratulations ! #% It is not always easy to come to a conclusion . #% However , civil aviation must carry on improving its safety record . #% The other matter to which I would like to draw attention - and I am sorry that it seems that , whilst there is sympathy , it will not find full recognition - is that of the position of our parliamentary assistants . #% Nevertheless , the rapporteur has done a marvellous job and what we have in front of us now is a coherent set of amendments , a coherent position that goes further than the common position , further than Mrs Flemming thinks we can go . #% The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised . #% Under the former procedure of cooperation of course we had our successes and the Commission was very much a part of that , and we still enjoy that acceptable relationship . #% Despite certain reservations , which many of us in the House feel , I commend the common position , as amended , to the House and wish future rapporteurs on the subject the same degree of support and interest that has been offered to me as your rapporteur . #% In 1945 the stakes were high for the policy makers ; the stakes are high now , but the reasons for moving forward are just as great as they were then . #% I very much welcome the call in the two reports to move to a country-of-origin principle for conduct-of-business rules , for advertising rules , for retail investors and for wholesale investors . #% This report by Mr Pronk goes some way towards doing that and doing it very well . #% If we look back over the last four years , we can see that there have been significant changes to the way in which the budgetary procedure has taken place . #% We are going to miss the chance to respond properly and completely unless we amend this common position to cover other events that have taken place in recent times within and outside the Union . #% In western and southern Europe Conservatives have not been at the forefront of the struggle for individual liberty and freedoms . #% The Member States have spent similar amounts . #% Most of us in this House , like Mrs Malliori who has just spoken , will be looking now in this grave crisis for the setting-up of something like a rapid alert system bringing together all the preventive measures which the European Union countries can carry out themselves . #% This is true for various other improvements that we would prefer to see made to the text . #% Mr President , at first reading the Liberal Group gave its support to the Commission 's proposals . #% The true guarantee against over-centralisation is , and should be , a political guarantee as we consider proposals in the normal procedures of the institutions : from the Commission , as Mr Méndez de Vigo has just said , when it makes its proposals to us as a Parliament , and also the Council . #% Not only should the European Parliament congratulate everyone involved , we should underline that through such creative public exercises our electors show us that they back the political commitment to development , embraced in our partnership with Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific and marked by tonight 's debate . #% In a joint declaration which we signed with the Council on 14 December 2000 we wanted to see these commitments reduced to normal levels by , if I remember correctly , December 2003 . #% No other explanation can justify the proofs of origin being issued to both manufactured and agricultural products - produced in settlements - which we consider illegal and therefore not covered by the agreement . #% I give notice now that if the Commission does not accept that amendment then , before the final vote , I as rapporteur will move that the issue be referred back to committee , where we will pursue further negotiations with the Commission on this issue . #% This exceptional consensus across all parties regarding the main thrust of the report has already had a positive impact in Romania . #% BMW , I am told by a small firm in my constituency - Whitford Motor Industry Services - just give a blunt no ; their dealers give a blunt no when asked for technical manuals - even by the owners of those cars . #% I hope that the rapporteur , Commission and Council will take note of the fact that they were at least 70 votes short of a qualified majority for second reading . #% 
There must be an equal balance of effort and sharing of responsibility to prevent both forum shopping by asylum seekers and ` pass the parcel ' by Member States . #% It has one of the lowest life expectancies , literacy rates and health indicators in a region which , as someone has already said , is itself rather poor . #% Citizens have a duty to tell the truth and I believe we have guaranteed that . #% These will tell us the real value of the work that we are doing and that we are asking others to do . #% That Europe is put behind us as we vote today to reunite our continent in peace , democracy and prosperity . #% This is on the basis of our longstanding opposition to the death penalty in the United States but in this particular case it is reinforced by the increasing evidence that the bombing was not carried out by a crazed lone bomber but as part of a conspiracy by the extreme right-wing Aryan Republic Army . #% The European Union must be coherent and respect the legislation that we pass through this House . #% This is a solvable problem but we have to do it conscious that we do it as one continent linked environmentally and ecologically . #% The message that is being sent by the actions of the Government in Pakistan at the moment is therefore extremely worrying for a state that says it is committed to democracy . #% That is very much a fact of life . #% We are not at all convinced that the present system can be fully justified in today 's world . #% I welcome , of course , the fact that Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the European Union in 2007 , even if there are still issues to be resolved , such as the system -- or lack of a system -- for the protection of children in Romania , and the level of organised crime in Bulgaria . #% For me this is an incredible proposal and one I would like to hear explained this morning . #% To help that , I and my Labour colleagues will vote tomorrow for the report , but against virtually all the amendments in support of the strategy explained earlier by my excellent colleague , Carmen Diez de Rivera Acaza . #% In addition , Commissioner Mandelson warned last night in the WTO debate that the figure of EUR 190 million , which the Commission has proposed , is now threatened by a 20 % cut agreed in the EU 's budget negotiations . #% Mr President , I am very pleased to be participating in this debate , not as a member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport but as one of the rapporteurs on the electronic communications package and a member both of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% Therefore , delay to the Galileo programme is not just unfortunate : it could have really grave consequences for the financial burden which is carried by the public purse . #% NATO effectiveness may have been fatally undermined . #% I hope Mrs Ahern will reconsider what she has said . #% It therefore sees things in a very different light when participating in international institutions , even if it is aware that for market access global rules of governance are needed . #% Mr President , the failure to prosecute Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok before an independent international tribunal is extremely worrying but also instructive . #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteurs . #% I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors . #% I am a member of the Environmental Advisory Board of a company called Shanks plc in the UK and have been for the past three years . #% These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is , therefore , subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS . #% I would like to raise three particular points . #% Secondly , why was violence used against women , and thirdly , what steps will the President take to bring to account those responsible ? #% The Environmental Advisory Board is solely concerned with the environmental audit performance of the company 's sites within the terms of EU legislation . #% How long will it be before there is a further increase in staff for the European Union military structures ? #% We want to see that reserve lifted . #% As Derek Fatchett , Minister of State at the Foreign Office , said last week in the UK parliament : it will be a fine judgement we will have to make , and one that the EU must be prepared to make . #% That is what my country has had and I believe we can keep it . #% Subsidies should be targeted to where they are most needed and an upper limit put on the size of individual payments , unless higher payments can be proved to benefit the wider rural economy or the environment . #% This is one of those times . #% So , finally , a party whose Turkish name translates as the ` Democratic Society Party ' is gone , but its aim of a democratic society in a modern Turkey must not be lost . #% Further to my question , as the Commissioner has just stated , the Commission is now drawing up its `` whistle-blowing '' charter to a certain extent . #% Thirdly , I do not welcome India 's involvement in ITER . #% I am very pleased to see the package you are putting to Council for their approval . #% The hazard analysis and critical control points were developed in the 1960s for NASA to guarantee high purity food for astronauts . #% However , UKIP voted against this report as we can not legitimise giving more power to the EU on matters such as criminal law and border protection . #% I would like to make one thing absolutely clear : the vast majority of those affected were good farmers whose husbandry bears no relationship to that of the few described by Mr Adam . #% We must keep that proposal solid , because if we fail , if we say terrorism is OK if it is in the Middle East , but not if it is in the United States or Europe , then we are making a mistake for which we will suffer . #% Let us also champion it for freedom and rights for people , including British people . #% This is most welcome but the programme will require early implementation once the security situation permits , coordination with contributions from other institutions and countries and very careful management to ensure effectiveness . #% I agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Cappato and especially with Baroness Ludford . #% Those are the points that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to raise . #% Mr President , you called for silence in the House . #% I think that is , in a way , the right approach . #% I am certain that if the honourable Member wanted to write explicitly on the NATO statement and the possibility of the use of plutonium and its side effects in that region , either in the course of acts of war or otherwise , my colleagues in the Commission would be more than ready to provide a comprehensive reply . #% I was particularly pleased with the emphasis placed on the need to prevent incidental mortality among dolphins and other species associated with tuna fisheries . #% I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something . #% Nevertheless , the price increases and the tax protests are timely , to remind us both about our dependence in Europe on imported energy and about the difficulties we face in achieving environmental objectives such as CO2 emission reduction . #% We vote their budget . #% The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem . #% They have striven to provide a coherent legal framework in an increasingly mobile world . #% There are can best be described on one side as nascent markets , and on the other , rather more sophisticated and developed approaches . #% It is , of course , also the year of implementation of the Treaty and , whilst we can welcome , and I do welcome , the concentration in the document on the implementation theme - and I think that the idea of working with the Member States in future to ensure implementation of law across the board in a much more coordinated fashion is excellent - I would have preferred to see something in the document about that piece of legislation that will be so central to our citizens , the citizens ' initiative , but President Barroso stole my thunder by mentioning it this morning , so that is good . #% The hyper-immune plasma products are nearly all imported into the European Union and 2,166,367 people in the European Union depend on them : some 400 thousand in Britain , 400 thousand in France , 100 thousand in the Netherlands , 40 thousand in Finland and so on . #% Mr President , as you would quite rightly assume , I am going to speak against the suggestion from Mrs Oomen-Ruijten . #% As regards the targets , I agree with what speakers have said about realistic targets . #% The package , as now formulated , seems a big improvement on the original proposal but we are still looking for consumers ' concern about levels of competition and service to be addressed through faster transition to a true internal market governed by general competition rules . #% This is the area on which we should be concentrating our efforts over the coming months and years . #% The new French Government wants a growth and stability pact and a federal bank which fulfils political aims and objectives of high employment and increasing prosperity for Europe 's people . #% Monitoring is necessary to make sure that what we have gained as a Parliament is maintained . #% To agree with Mrs Jackson , I find that one of the areas missing here is the cost to the citizen of these policies : we need to ensure that Member States tackle this problem in parallel to getting quality right . #% It creates a flexible regime and allows Member States considerable discretion in line with the application of the principle of subsidiarity , according to the circumstances as they see it . #% 
Parliament , as well as the Council , should be kept informed and consulted on issues such as the accession of new members and the appointment of the executive director . #% We assert our right to follow the same procedure should there be a casual vacancy from the Commission during its five-year mandate . #% That again is increasingly important for safety . #% In that context we look , for example , to the United Kingdom government to take all necessary short-term protective measures as well as to face up to the necessary longer-term decisions with regard to the disposal of radioactive waste . #% I look forward to , and am confident that I will see , some progress soon on all these issues in relation to the Services Directive , which I am so pleased he supports . #% We should bear that in mind in everything we say and do leading up to ultimate enlargement in the next century . #% This is because road traffic noise is a cause of stress , and stress is a cause of ill health and , indeed , of fatalities , and it is therefore important to address that issue . #% Yet there are still those who seek to apologise for the terrorists and try to establish some sort of moral equivalency between terrorist acts and , for example , the actions of the security forces of the democracies engaged in counter-terrorism . #% I do not agree that what has happened reduces the topical importance of the issue . #% We have to remember that this piece of legislation is Member State driven , and the fact that the Member States have met and managed to agree a comprehensive list of projects has to be recognised positively , whilst not denying Parliament its rights under the codecision procedure . #% The economic , environmental and social situation in Russia is dire , but Russia must also do more to help itself by reforming the economy and banking sector , collecting taxes and overhauling the legal system . #% Regarding HIV and Aids , prevention is also a priority . #% How strongly is the single market established at the moment ? #% Madam President , this afternoon , in this Chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House . #% I , like many British MEPs , have received many letters from people in the region that I represent . #% So I hope that it will go through tomorrow and that it will be possible to put this action into place and start to sell European beef not only within Europe , but also throughout the world so that it will again be recognized as among the best in the world . #% in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the strategic approach on the supply of energy as contained in the Laperrouze report on the Second Strategic Energy Review . #% We have already heard discussion about culture and jobs and how culture industries and people working in culture can contribute to the economy and can really help . #% Will it be an offer based on the current voting system , which all Member States have agreed to change in the Constitutional Treaty , or will it be based on an offer made on the basis of the Constitutional Treaty ? #% Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction , in the shape of Mrs Meissner 's report . #% Thus 30 , 000 SMEs a year go under , losing Europe 300 , 000 jobs because of the weaknesses of the legal and administrative environment for transferring successful businesses on the death or abdication of the founding entrepreneur . #% This is the crunch time for the internal market . #% This is a good basis for a compromise and I think that colleagues from all sides of the House will support this compromise budget provision . #% In addition , of course , I have visited a variety of Member States to ensure that governments , and indeed national parliaments , are fully informed . #% Mr President , I was present with Parliament 's delegation in Geneva at the Human Rights Commission last year and saw with my own eyes how discredited that Commission had become and how it was being held hostage in its proceedings by countries which were themselves the worst perpetrators of human rights abuse . #% In the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday , one of the things we agreed was that the European Union 's common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention , paying special attention to long-term conflict situations . #% But European employment laws are substantially shaped by the social partners who represent the big employers and the big trade unions but the minority of the workers . #% Mr President , I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home . #% It concerns the use of sucrose esters in canned liquid coffee and tea which are now being sold hot direct to the consumer . #% That firm supplied glucose syrup or treacle to Dutch feed manufacturers . #% Mr President , the tragedy at Dover was one of the most appalling incidents that anyone here can recall . #% Indeed the rules imposed by the Taliban would appear to derive less from the Koran than from the tribal customs dependent on a view that sees women 's value as essentially procreative and economic alone . #% We know perfectly well that the insurance industries are not yet able to offer schemes which would meet the needs of this Parliament or the Commission in bringing forward this legislation . #% The President of the Council , Leo Tindemans , and the President of the Commission , Gaston Thorn , came to the Committee on Institutional Affairs , as it was then , to ask us not to do it . #% So we must not allow the candidate countries to think the process is over . #% But they represent a further responsible step on the journey of dealing with the consequences of pollution across Europe and the wider world . #% Many of those small business will have no experience of exporting , they will not have a network of lawyers , they will be uncertain themselves about how they are going to deal with consumer complaints . #% Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is . #% This is so critical for us to function as a parliament . #% That claim was being negotiated by insurers in two Member States , and if it had been litigated , it would have been litigated in the UK , probably according to UK law . #% I would now like to turn to the report by Mr Paasilinna who , with his customary thoroughness and ability to make practical proposals , has come up with some well-thought-out ideas on education , health , disabled citizens and the elderly , and the importance of ensuring access for rural areas and small businesses . #% Resolution 1701 mandates UNIFIL to assist the Government of Lebanon to secure its borders . #% Mr Lambsdorff has empowered me to suggest that this is not entirely Bulgaria 's fault . #% It can stick AAA ratings to junk bonds issued by the eurozone 's failed economies . #% The budget of the United Nations should be increased , not decreased in this very unfair way by the United States . #% As a minister responsible in the United Kingdom for setting up our own national criminal intelligence service a few years ago , I am very confident that the make-up of these organisations in Member States is already well addressed . #% We need a rolling programme which will cover all legislation and look at simplifying , consolidating , re-casting , sometimes repealing legislation . #% The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals . #% No cases at all . #% The Polish Government has indicated that it believes it will be ready for accession in January 2003 . #% Finally , I welcome paragraph 16 which calls for a review of the way we deal with human rights issues in Parliament . #% in writing . - British Conservatives support initiatives to ensure success in the fight against fraud in the context of the EU budget . #% Therefore I believe all the ensuing comments , which are highly prejudicial , should be deleted from the text - all of them . #% Shame on all of you ! #% We are already getting some indications that the accession countries are saying that they do not have enough time and need more breathing space . #% It is made up of four years ' implementation and five years to bring down the working time from 58 to 48 hours . #% Madam President , my point of order has , perhaps to some extent been pre-empted by the earlier discussion , but following the Irish referendum I should like to ask whether you , in your capacity as President of Parliament , will write to the President of Ireland congratulating the Irish people on their wise and far-sighted decision , which strikes a blow for freedom , independence , self-determination and the nation state . #% For Parliament , it is crucial that we have a political interlocutor to negotiate the establishment and future programme of the External Action Service , so , please , states - bring us your people for all these posts . #% We waste far too much of the taxpayer 's money on this budget and we must look carefully at restructuring and reforming our agricultural policy across the EU . #% For the sake of good governance and democratic oversight , the Member States should commit themselves - whether in a Council declaration or elsewhere - to a revision of Article 202 , which not only introduces equivalent powers for Parliament and for the Council but also ensures there is proper oversight by this House and by the Council . #% I was very heartened to hear his words this morning about the Commission 's preparedness to look at the review of the inter-institutional agreement . #% Further to the amendment to the 2004 draft budget tabled in this House , and placing in reserve the appropriations under three of the budget headings related to the activities of DG Press , the Commission was given the task of trying to reach an accommodation that , as far as possible , satisfied the demands for operational continuity sought by Parliament , whilst also securing financial monitoring and control . #% But over the next few years the British rebate will increase markedly in size and the poorest Member States will have to contribute towards it . #% I would normally rise before each report , but if you are agreeable , I shall make this statement once and we could accept it for all three reports in the culture package . #% Commissioner Patten rather surprisingly replied that this was not a priority . #% Yes , Europe must change as you say , but unless that change puts sustainability at its heart then your presidency will lose a vital opportunity to help the European Union regain public support and it will squander a key moment to address climate change seriously . #% 
These are not fitted with catalytic converters yet , and so do not need this type of fuel . #% As regards Alicante , as far as the transfer is concerned , I feel it is of the greatest importance that the agency is able to call on the budgetary authority for a contribution if necessary . #% I believe that the European Union is best equipped to deal with the challenges of immigration through a nuanced system which is not dictatorial , not through more harmonised European legislation or the moral rulings of the European courts , but instead through solidarity , cooperation and good communication among European neighbours . #% Mr President , I have stood before this House many times over the past four years and called for revisions to the way in which European Union Structural and Cohesion Funds are administered . #% And I say this despite Senhor Barroso 's comments on partnership . #% We will not be supporting any of the three amendments , which we believe are misconceived and -- deliberately or not -- mischievous . #% That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about . #% I have read the notes on the work programme by the Belgian presidency and there is little or no reference to it . #% Finally , given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza , I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering . #% But there is still a huge gap between the grand rhetoric about using less oil and the amount of real practical action taking place on the ground . #% We will no doubt hear a great deal from them on that theme in the next few weeks and months in the run-up to a British general election . #% I would argue , as my group would argue , for consistency when it comes to the application of moral disapproval . #% Now pensions are almost always related to earnings , so do we see here an attempt to harmonise wages ? #% The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation . #% On 1 July after 150 years of British rule Hong Kong will be handed over the Chinese People 's Republic . #% I should also like to thank Mr Souladakis for what he said . #% Nevertheless , it is time to be more transparent . #% Mr Lukashenko preaches a curious pan-Slavic , anti-Western nationalism , with an added cult of personality . #% I also believe , however , that the responsibility of carriers should be limited . #% There is no justification for the idea that the contributions of the EEA countries should be comparable to those of EU Member States and the Commission 's demand for a 22-fold increase for Norway is absurd . #% Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme . #% The battle against these organisations is a continuous one and it is right that this should not be in the public gaze . #% It confirms that we were right in the decision that we took . #% How else can a genuine parliament function , or is this not a genuine parliament ? #% Mr President , I rise on a point of order . #% Therefore , notwithstanding the obvious and manifest failing of the British authorities in this respect , clearly the Commission 's performance was disastrous . #% May I begin by congratulating the President-in-Office on securing a ground-breaking agreement on the EU code of conduct on arms exports this Monday . #% As a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year . #% Mr President , my question is to both the Commissioners . #% It is the highest priority and because it is the highest priority we are not just allowing a follow-on of what has been done heretofore because some uncertainties have been identified in the interim report . #% When will we ever learn ? #% The Roadmap is specific on a number of points , not least an immediate cessation of violence on both sides , an initial freezing of settlements and their eventual dismantling , and a willingness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to face up to its historical responsibilities , and rein in the men of violence . #% Creditors will be entitled to charge a statutory interest rate on their debts , encouraging debtors to pay early . #% Also , I should like to ask the President-in-Office whether it might not be a good idea to reactivate UNICOI , which was a commission of inquiry set up when we had the crisis in Rwanda ? #% That seems to me to be quite an achievement and a step in the right direction . #% Mr President , I must apologise to the Commissioner because , as she probably knows , I do not normally make a practice of turning up just in time to speak . #% Mr President , indeed we have much to look forward to in the course of the next six months and I notice in these proposals that there is an absolute mass of proposed financial services regulation . #% We would like full transparency in the Council in future and for all its legislative discussions to be open to the public . #% I thank the Commissioner for that reply and although , as she says , it is a technical subject , it is more a question of the interpretation of how we fulfil MAGP requirements . #% I welcome Mrs Maij-Weggen 's opinion and recommendations and , in particular , her view that the European Ombudsman should give an assessment of the regulation : how it is working and how the exemptions are applied . #% I would like to affirm my Group 's general support for his report and for the Commission 's proposal . #% Is this European democracy ? #% Mr President , I speak particularly for the UK Independence Party . #% Not much has changed and now I bring mine here in March 2010 . #% A new Community initiative can be tailored to these needs . #% They will be predominantly self-employed . #% Just look at the disastrous , ruinous common fisheries policy . #% For many years , there was no sign at all of ICAO taking any action to deal with the problem of growing aircraft noise so we in this Parliament took action . #% At the moment they have to transport feed from other parts of the country at greater expense , with more of an environmental impact because of the transport . #% The most common cancer among women is breast cancer . #% Mr Cohn-Bendit implied that he knew rather more about the case by trying to say that these difficulties and problems have affected many parties in France . #% Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked . #% In the interests of harmony , I urge all Members of the European Parliament to support my amendment to both reports . #% The Ivory Coast is a long way away ; most countries in Africa do not have strong laws to protect human and environmental health from the effects of hazardous waste , but that is no reason for us here in Strasbourg to walk away from this case and its lessons . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , there is a perfectly good existing satellite system available for EU citizens ' use . #% We believe that what the Commissioner is going to say is that the part relating to third countries , which should come into force from 2002 , will not come into force and will in fact be suspended . #% I am amazed to see British Conservatives attacking a national British institution when I do not believe that Frenchmen , Spaniards or Germans would do the same to their own national institutions . #% So I believe that she has done outstanding work here . #% Just yesterday there was an announcement that two very poor eastern European countries -- Romania and Bulgaria -- will join the EU . #% Conservatives believe that the EU budget must deliver value for money for the EU taxpayer . #% Lord Mandelson is still getting GBP 78 000 a year from the European Commission and , of course , gets a dependent pension on this in just a few years ' time - a conflict of interest if ever I saw one . #% I have an interest in a forestry business in New Zealand , inherited from my father , so that gives me a practical interest . #% I say to the people of Galicia that it should be our own Council of Ministers and the IMO , not them , with oil on their hands at this moment . #% On category 4 , the Group has been consistent in its approach to Turkey and Meda . #% I urge you to pass our congratulations on to President Kaczyński . #% Firstly , we had to adopt an unusual procedure for one point that remains in some doubt , that is , the site of the new authority . #% 
Commissioner , I hope you will agree that this is a Treaty obligation for us all to look at . #% After all the headlines that we heard at Cologne last year , less than $ 13 billion of the $ 100 billion promised has actually been cancelled and as the Commission and the Council have told us , contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund are still way below target . #% Equally , in the future of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership , we urge that all actions conducted under the terms of the various partnerships be pursued without discrimination on any grounds , including sexual orientation . #% It marks an important further step forward in the laying down of proper requirements so long as we still have to carry on with the transport of animals . #% It conforms to the legal requirements of the Treaty and of the regulations . #% The Ministers agreed to let the discussion run for at least another year . #% Companies often say they should mainstream CSR , and this initiative reflects that public policy should do so too . #% Those who take unfair advantage over their fellow athletes are simply destroying the whole purpose of sport . #% The criticisms of the Commission during the debate on the Medina report were made in that spirit . #% Civil society has a key role to play in Africa ' s development process . #% I rather sympathise with my colleagues who think that the way in which the new programmes are going to be organised makes it difficult to see what is actually happening . #% People in crises need a European rapid reaction facility as much as a fish needs a bicycle . #% But on balance it is impossible to agree with important sections of this report . #% There is no public ownership , no state subsidy , so expansion in the development of facilities and services in British ports depends on retaining the confidence of private investors and high standards of service and employment . #% Mr President , I wish to support my colleagues who have taken a very broad-ranging view of this important proposal . #% Are they really going to turn around and say : ` Well , actually , we could not do it because we were not sure if Baltic sprats were big enough for our nets . #% Unfortunately , those letters and responses have never been made public or made available to the Petitions Committee or to Parliament . #% At the moment , as we see in Europe , the Bundesbank acts in the interest of the German economy . #% He is the person not adhering to UN resolutions . #% I find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with Mr Hughes this evening , and certainly with most of what Mr Pronk said , about the ` on call ' issue being resolvable , between social partners , in various sectors and in other ways . #% If there are different standards in different countries , including the USA which is the capital of the nuclear world , surely it is best to harmonize at the highest level the regulations , standards and conditions for transport of this material , rather than just leaving it to local decision ? #% It has received widespread approbation in the committee and I hope that when it is voted on tomorrow it will receive similarly widespread support throughout the House . #% Representatives of the Member States were invited by the Commission to a meeting of the emergencies committee dealing with consumer health in October 1997 to discuss the issue , given its potential implications for consumer health and safety . #% The Commission probably built on previous mistakes by attaching so much weight to the idea of a programme . #% I support also those who call for a European quality assurance scheme on beef and I support the call for the full identification of all animals . #% We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age . #% I even read in the British press that Kabila and Qadhafi are giving money now to Mugabe ' s campaign , which is a bit frightening . #% We have to decide whether we have not failed completely in this and whether it is not time to start again . #% You told us that the flag and the anthem would be dropped , but I have not seen much evidence of that . #% If so , what was said ? #% The Russian authorities should not be too proud to seek assistance , which is needed on several levels . #% Fortunately , a Google news search shows that there has been no response to the suggestion at all . #% We would be happy to accept such an amendment . #% We asked the Member States to get their house in order , to give us an assurance that the control systems they were putting in place were adequate and sufficient and that when EU money was being spent , it was being spent correctly . #% Mr President , I find myself totally supportive of the need to exercise very strict restraint over the budget , most importantly over the money we spend on the institutions . #% He found that he was touching almost a piece of jelly . #% The honourable Member may already be aware that the United Kingdom Department of Transport has informed the Commission that all cases relating to United Kingdom hauliers in respect of the 1996 strike have been addressed and that procedures are in place to resolve outstanding cases from the 1997 strike without undue delay . #% Dump it ! #% However , there are ever-increasing pressures to sacrifice personal freedom to the quest for security , to compromise our humanitarian obligations to refugees and to fail to integrate legal immigrants . #% Lastly , I say to the military leaders , that by imprisoning a 74-year-old man , they show not their strength but their weakness . #% I apologise again for Mr Bradbourn 's unavoidable absence . #% Mr President , the location of the agency ' s headquarters , as this morning ' s discussions again made evident , has led to some controversy in the Council as well as in this House . #% This House will welcome an easing of tensions at the most dangerous flashpoint in the globe which only two years ago was on the brink of a nuclear war . #% So it is paragraph 13 calling for equal opportunities of distribution that is far more important than the harmonization of VAT rates which in some countries would only mean the introduction of a tax that we do not already have . #% The manpower is available , we just need to introduce effective training and ensure there is no discrimination in allocating the jobs . #% I would remind you that the Commission is responsible for the enforcement of the rules of this regulation . #% The Romanian Government should seriously reconsider the heartless position it is currently maintaining . #% Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report . #% In 2005 , the Council brought shame on itself and sowed the seed of the current sovereign debt problems by weakening the Stability and Growth Pact and simultaneously denying audit powers to Eurostat . #% The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance . #% Therefore , any successful policy must deal with not only the exclusion issues but also the causes of migration . #% Specific instances are given where the gaps and deficiencies in the existing legal framework need to be addressed and where comprehensive approaches to legislation , rather than ad hoc tinkering , will be important for both established and new risks . #% Now , and without adequate consultation with the United States , the European Union is preparing to take over the NATO mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and apparently plans to assume the military responsibilities in Bosnia . #% However , we have abstained in this report as we believe the measures identified are so prescriptive that they would achieve little in the way of the desirable goals of improving the position of women in the day-to-day economic life of the Member States of the EU . #% I appreciate the answer but I do have to ask , with the knowledge that of course Aung San Suu Kyi has been under virtual house arrest now for about 120 days : how can you suggest that a prisoner is able to carry out a meaningful dialogue or negotiation with her jailer ? #% The Commission report ` Consumer policy strategy 2002-2006 ' , and indeed the Whitehead report , are both extremely positive steps in this direction . #% You can ask for access to information , but if you do not get it then you have to start applying a certain rigidity and postpone discharge . #% As the Commissioner said on another occasion , the progress of integration is unstoppable . #% We in the ECR want a Europe built on the secure foundations of popular support and the democratic legitimacy offered by the institutions of its nation states . #% I have left a big corporation , where do I go from here ? ' . #% Its effect is that we are talking about a limited number of couples . #% The Commission must assert itself quickly as the new arrangements for the Foreign Minister and the Foreign Service , the team presidency and especially the so-called full-time President of the European Council are put in place . #% in writing . - A permanent shortage of organs for transplantation hampers the wonderful efforts of health care professionals to help patients . #% Action is also clearly needed at EU level , not just at a national level . #% I think I know the reason why - because he is knackered or should I say ` physically exhausted ' following a football match this afternoon between British Labour Members and British Conservative Members which the Labour Members won by 7 goals to 1 . #% However , the debate we have had , principally from that side of the House , has mainly been concerned with organisational models and protectionism . #% 
We need a way forward , we need to be objective about this , we must not just bow to vested interests . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I really do not know where to start , as everyone has been so kind . #% I remain entirely unconvinced that the sort of interventionist approach we have taken here is right . #% It is particularly important in the areas of shipping contracts , i.e. charter parties , commercial contracts , insurance , reinsurance , banking contracts and rescheduling of debts , which often specify English law as a law-governing contract even though neither of the parties is of English origin . #% I am sure Mr McCreevy is be aware how good his staff can be . #% The Palestinian parliamentary elections in January will , of course , be telling . #% In any event the EU should not let up on criticizing human rights abuses in China and it should monitor developments in Hong Kong closely over the coming months and years . #% I would criticise , as Mr Bernié has done , the reliance of the rapporteur to a considerable extent on jargon . #% As has already been said , there is evidence that whitefinger can be caused by hand-arm vibration , but I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that whole body vibration causes tremendous health risks for workers . #% If retailers are not prepared to help customers orient themselves to these historic changes , then Parliament should blow its whistle and be prepared to legislate to ensure double pricing . #% I wonder though if the Commissioner would say whether or not he would agree that intensive agriculture is not likely to be the way forward for north or south when we consider that the world population at the end of this century will be 10 billion . #% If you do succeed , you will trap those southern countries inside an economic prison , in which people 's suffering will be untold , while the northern countries will find themselves paying , forever , a massive bill and interest rates that are far too high for their own economies . #% I am not sure that will help , as lifting it might relieve the increasing economic hardship , worsened by Castro 's stupidity in recently banning the dollar for trading purposes as a response to tighter travel restrictions by the US on Cuban exiles visiting their families . #% Part of that is to overcome all the ingrained suspicion and problems that they have had , and to make it clear that what we have achieved here is probably the biggest single set of deregulatory measures in opening up markets that has ever happened as a result of one single directive - we have heard about the thousands of measures that have been changed - and similarly the first major investment by Member States in promoting the single market to businesses . #% Another key amendment is to make sure the user company or the agency can be comparative , to give Member States that choice . #% The Commission considered that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly related to the tasks of the post in question . #% Russia also needs to be reminded that , as it bankrolls the regime with very cheap gas at USD 50 per 1 000 m3 , it should support democracy there , being a full member of the Council of Europe . #% The fault also lies with the Commission because we need greater clarity of information in order to analyse budget implementation . #% By the year 2008 we could do away with the scandal of spending ECU 1 billion of EU taxpayers ' money annually supporting a crop which kills our citizens . #% The existing 15 Member States are certainly not perfect and we need to invest at least as much as we do in our agriculture . #% They are now lacking that legal certainty and still have the full implications of the framework directive and temporary mobile work sites directive to deal with . #% Everyone in this House knows how important skilled interpreters are . #% The debate has been very wide-ranging debate as regards how we legislate in this process . #% We have called for tougher measures to be introduced by the Council and for the other countries of Southern Africa , in particular the Republic of South Africa , to play a stronger role in bringing about change for the better in Zimbabwe . #% Mr President , I am pleased that Mr Tannock has expressed his regret at the offence caused by the remarks he made last week at a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% I therefore asked the Director-General of Administration and Personnel to produce a draft for rules that would take into account best practice in the administrations of Member States and of other international public bodies and to give precision to procedures . #% Finally , I was pleased at the references the minister made to the question of the applicant countries . #% It would help if we could have some clarification from the Commissioner on that . #% So , I repeat , if world trade rules are destroying people ' s livelihoods and damaging the environment or animal welfare we need to change the rules . #% Imagine our sorrow therefore to learn of the unacceptable repatriation of tens of thousands of mainly Indonesian foreign workers as a response to the economic crisis and to be acquainted with the deaths of eight Indonesians under detention at centres for illegal immigrants . #% But the response by Israel is totally disproportionate and can not be supported . #% Mr President , the first question to be asked about this report is : Why do we need this directive ? #% I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also . #% On behalf of my group , I welcome the emphasis on impact assessments and the emphasis on involvement of our citizens and transparency . #% This directive , therefore , is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut ! #% The time has now come , though , to be able to send Parliamentary representatives to all the meetings and to participate in the IGC on the same basis as the Commission , as a Community institution , to make our case , to advocate our proposals and at times to argue against the proposals made by others . #% But in the end we have come up with something which is equitable , sensible and just . #% But that good work , as we have seen from a number of reports recently , has been undermined by smuggling , estimated at up to some 20 , 000 tonnes a year , a third of world trade , undermining quite substantially the legitimate industry that is trying to provide substitutes . #% I have talked to the Commission already about the possibility of publishing results on the Internet , but I am sure the Commission could come up with some other ideas . #% It might help if today 's Minutes showed the average cost of one of those and possibly , by extension , the amount of trees we consume in a year , often for quite frivolous reasons . #% Mr President , Lebanon has a recent history of civil war and a complex ethnic and religious balance . #% In spite of Commissioner Dimas ' good words about the importance of tackling illegal logging , the Commission proposal as it stands simply is not up to the job . #% We agree with the importance of China 's role in Africa and the Middle East . #% author . - Mr President , this is not about telling Member States exactly what they should or should not be spending their money on . #% The two camps are the optimists and the pessimists . #% Many Cypriots require support to catch the spirit of Europe and to look forward with more self-assurance to being a reunited community . #% I really do not believe that the Finance Ministers have taken this question on board and I would ask the Commission and the Council to look at this matter again . #% Energy is the lifeblood of any nation state and , of course , I am sent here to represent a nation state . #% Only such an arrangement will ensure that our citizens get the service that they really deserve . #% We call also for the use in legislation of clear and comprehensible language and for the provision of correlation tables in the transposition of directives , so that the risk of gold-plating is diminished . #% Many in my group support the text as it now stands , feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures . #% On the basis of this contradiction in the report I did not support it . #% This was an important area of strengthening . #% This should integrate with civil society initiatives , just as NGOs should be able to contribute actively to the UN biannual meeting of states in July . #% Mr President , I thank my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy for giving me another opportunity to work on Romania 's accession to the European Union of Romania . #% Mr Cox has explained very clearly that the technology has outpaced the VAT systems . #% As she moves her activities to another stage , or should I say back to the stage where she started her career , I am sure that all of us will join in wishing her well , thanking her very much for her work , and we can demonstrate our support for that by our unanimous support for the report when we vote later on . #% Do they have to simply accept a fait accompli ? #% The second point is to draw the attention of colleagues to Parliament 's own work on the Sixth Framework Programme . #% Mr President , I represent the south-east region of England and am the only Member to live in the county of Hampshire , very close to the port of Southampton , the home port of the new , which will be the greatest liner in the world . #% These will be addressed in the review , with which the Commission and the Presidency also both agree . #% It is a prospect which most people in the United Kingdom view with disquiet , the prospect of following a budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Ecofin , the Commission or the ECB informing that Chancellor that he or she is not permitted to increase spending on schools and hospitals and those services which are of such huge value to the people of the United Kingdom . #% You are right to call these political games . #% They are evident in every town , city and street we go into across the Union , in particular the UK . #% The same applies to other urgent matters . #% Perhaps Commissioner Fischler should put him in charge of inspecting abattoirs . #% 
As she says , later on when we come to renegotiate all these things her point of view will be very much taken into account . #% Worst of all in recent years is the case of East Timor , where a third of the population is estimated to have died . #% Four weeks ago very few of my colleagues said that this debate would take place . #% But they are the tip of an iceberg that needs to be exposed . #% Yet here they are in our own building . #% I am also pleased that it is on the agenda during the European Year of People with Disabilities . #% I take a rather more pessimistic view than the previous speaker . #% But , equally , I think we should be looking at our own resettlement policies to at least offer assistance to some of those who , once again , are finding their lives absolutely in turmoil . #% President-in-Office , thank you for that reply . #% The Israelis have not quite released the 10 000 prisoners , many of them held without charge or trial . #% Let us maintain the Lisbon balance overall . #% It will thus increase confidence in the European Union , and I think it is therefore a very appropriate 50th birthday present for the European Union to give itself in the run-up to March 2007 . #% I know the Commissioner and his team want that but we must help him to convince his less enlightened colleagues of that need , not least at budget time . #% It seems that the one Head of State holding out against it , the valiant President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic , will be browbeaten into giving his consent shortly . #% It is important that we pay tribute to developing countries and to the negotiating skills that they displayed . #% Chinese graduates are rightly , and to their credit , moving up the value-added chain and very soon we may need to face the possibility that there will be very little that Europe can produce which China can not produce more efficiently . #% It is a clarification point on TRIPs and TRIMs . #% Enforcement will be made easier with the involvement of local people and civil society in these countries , and we must ensure that their right to be heard and involved is maintained and listened to . #% For the reasons outlined above the British Conservative Delegation abstained on this report . #% Already there has been root and branch reform of government with many new ministerial positions and responsibilities . #% It is something that we , as representatives of those citizens , should strive our utmost to ensure does not happen . #% The substantial majority which Mr Mayer rallied in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was , of course , for a response which , as my colleague has said , was less than he would have wished . #% In other words , it does not match up to the requirements of the developing transatlantic partnership in the future . #% Any stability pact that emerges from the Ecofin Council that does that will be unacceptable not only to this House , but I believe will be unacceptable to the 15 national parliaments within the European Union . #% I should like to touch upon the issue of collection targets for portable batteries . #% That is why we agreed on an ad hoc procedure ; that is why we agreed on the letter of amendment in the autumn . #% Clearly the French and the Dutch share a Devonian 's ability to understand it . #% I fear that the propositions that Parliament is putting forward are far too timid and believe that we should go down the road of decoupling . #% ESDP is not only a threat to NATO - which is a supremely intergovernmental organisation . #% At the heart of the debate has been Mrs Gebhardt , a very hardworking and determined rapporteur . #% The Danish Environmental Protection Agency alleged that these teethers leached an amount of phthalates judged inadmissible for babies . #% Combinations of public and private capital should be thrown into the equation as well . #% Finally , if the people of Belarus so wish , we must also offer them the prospect of possible EU membership in the longer term . #% Secondly , you will be aware , Commissioner , that one of the important things we need to ensure is that people in Rwanda have a sense that they are returning to a country that will deliver justice . #% I hope that he will take that on board in the vote tomorrow so that we can deliver the benefits for consumers and for manufacturers . #% This is an amendment to an existing directive on the general minimum requirements for work equipment at work . #% We have to proceed with caution and with flexibility . #% Ninety-nine percent of the truth is not honest ; it is not good enough ; it is not the necessary 100 % . #% Could you ask the Commission if it would make a statement on this matter at some stage before the House ? #% Obviously the answer to this is the euro and the euro will boost many industries across Europe and help improve the job situation as a whole . #% Curious things went round the world about sheep meat , about lamb . #% We still need greater emphasis -- as Mr Brok stated in the report -- on implementation and enforcement . #% The Foreign Secretary did not say that we will be having proportional representation in time for the 1999 elections , he said : ' It is our wish and intention to introduce a new electoral system , based on the list and proportional representation for the next European elections . ' #% We expected at least a moratorium on export subsidies and an end to those domestic supports which to me and to many others are simply hidden subsidies . #% When we look at our major rivals - firstly Japan - the Japanese are making no attempt to draw up similar legislation to that put forward by the Commission . #% There will be elaborate procedures and delays . #% Mr President , again on behalf of my British Conservative colleagues -- my colleague Lord Inglewood , who worked on this , has spoken already -- and my Group , I certainly welcome very much the excellent work of Mr Manders over a long period and also through conciliation . #% And if Europe wants to be left behind , left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism , than yes , vote against this report tomorrow . #% It becomes the consequence of paragraph 7 . #% The formula would be a form of compromise , with 24 months ' transposition and 12 months ' transition , which I welcomed , through the Luxembourg presidency 's efforts , and agreed to very easily . #% We would like to highlight - and we have highlighted in our resolution - the need for action , particularly in the air transport sector . #% People may say it is unrealistic but we can not tolerate a situation where thousands of our fellow citizens die needlessly on our roads every year . #% However , I disagree with his priorities . #% Why is this urgent ? #% One of the names of Lloyd 's of London received a letter from Lloyd 's criticising him for daring to raise this matter with the Commission , and a rather threatening letter saying that it was a clear breach of the terms of an agreement . #% Parliament has agreed to put money into the budget for this , and I welcome that . #% He has secured an agreement with the Council which is a practical compromise and which will reap considerable environmental rewards whilst providing for industry a great deal more certainty than the original proposal . #% Do they have any say if , for example , Poland were to join with specific derogations which , as far as the EFTA countries were concerned , undermined the EEA agreement ? #% We have seen GDP growing by almost 5 % , the rate of inflation dropping significantly , a surge in foreign investment and a major cut in unemployment levels . #% What signal does this send to our American allies ? #% The whole nature of the problem , all the difficulties that we have with Hong Kong are based on the difficulties Britain has handing over its last remnants of empire and on the very strong sense of hurt pride and , indeed , humiliation that China feels in having ceded territory to my country in the past . #% This is , of course , true , but equally , we must not allow human rights to become a political weapon in the terrorist armoury . #% Both India and the EU have long traditions of promoting renewable energy . #% At this time , when we perhaps are being a little over-assertive with some of the legislation we are bringing forward , I do not want anyone to have to confirm why they have opted to receive , for instance , Ammunition Weekly or why they have chosen to get some information from Amnesty International . #% It is a serious point and some of the Commission 's problems could be helped a little by closer collaboration with animal welfare organizations working in this area who , I am sure , would be only too grateful to assist . #% I salute the courage of all the brave coalition forces in Iraq who are fighting for law and order and freedom and justice in that country , and against international Islamic terrorism . #% 
Mr President , my interest in this subject stems not just from my membership of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media but also from my membership of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Hungary . #% It is an excellent system and , incidentally , we could save the taxpayers some money by using it . #% Furthermore , where certain directives are concerned , the constitutional regions have a role to play in the transposition process . #% I would appeal to the Council and the Commission to be wary about implementing and establishing too many targets if those targets are clearly not always going to be met . #% We need a new system . #% This deadline is , of course , well past and our main priority , therefore , is to create this post as soon as we possibly can . #% This debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists . #% Now is not the time to say that we need to rewrite the text . #% In my explanatory statement I underline the seriousness of these impacts that we face . #% I would like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal which is balanced and in proportion to the problem . #% There has been much talk about concentrating on core tasks and of achieving better quality of European legislation rather than more quantity . #% It certainly does not reach the highest standards set by some of our Member States , but we are moving in the right direction , although of course it is still not perfect . #% The issue of budgetisation again is something of which this Parliament 's Committee on Development and Cooperation is , as you know , in favour , and has been for some time . #% Amnesty International describes the human rights abuses as appalling and catalogues the regular torture of political prisoners , including the Asmara-11 group of former parliamentarians . #% If you succeed , then we should change the name : get rid of ` European Union ' and call it the ` Debt Union ' . #% That is the right way to go , and therefore I very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report . #% We have to look at our methods of agriculture within the Europe of the 15 and the way in which we define quality . #% Add to that the fact that up to 20 % , a fifth of former breast cancer patients , do not return to work and it becomes clear that something needs to be done if we are to meet the Lisbon target for women 's participation in the labour market . #% So all three institutions need to address this whole problem of fishing . #% Madam President , there is , unfortunately , a long history of struggle for the redistribution of land to the poor and landless in the Philippines but its bitterness has not diminished over recent years . #% Moving on , if I may , to the role of Europol - which is fulfilling a vital role and to which we have to give our support - it is very important that all the Member States should as soon as possible ratify the convention so that we can make progress . #% For example , I recently met with the Australian Ambassador to the European Union . #% I welcome the fact that this incitement to violence through broadcasts has been dealt with in the UN resolution , but would also like to see the United Nations being granted , as part of its mandate , a peacekeeper 's right to deal with such situations . #% In such cases , the Commission proposes that the existing purely administrative recognition of certain partnerships should be maintained . #% Finally , a partnership must be a partnership of equals . #% Today 's youngsters will need a pension in the future . #% Nevertheless , we have worked very well together on this . #% Secondly , there is a contradiction between external policy and administrative policy . #% So they know what they have to do . #% Those are the facts , not as presented by the rapporteur . #% Healthier birds produce a better quality product . #% The Tunisian Magistrates ' Association has complained of increased intimidation by the Government after its board issued a communiqué criticising the attack on Abou . #% If this is so , then action is needed urgently . #% Much needs to be done , as has been said this evening , by both the applicant countries to prepare for membership and the EU itself so that its policies and institutions are reformed in order to meet the challenges of enlargement . #% We have seen the introduction of rights to assistance and tougher laws on ticket pricing transparency , as well as tough compensation measures in the package travel directive . #% Madam President , I notice from the voting record that my vote was not recorded for the first two votes , for which I was present , and which I thought that my machine had registered . #% Andorra uses the euro , the Channel Islands use the pound sterling , but they pick and choose which laws they want to follow . #% in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party ( EPLP ) has abstained on the legislative proposal , due to the fact the UK is not obliged to follow this Directive , as it has an opt-out/opt in on JHA measures concerning immigration and asylum . #% Only one in four girls attend primary school in Niger ; if girls start to go to school then women will start to break into their own grain stores . #% Before France or other Member States find themselves condemned before the Strasbourg or Luxembourg courts they need to remember that a European model of integration rests on respect for differences and freedom to choose , not on illiberal imposition of uniformity . #% We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels . #% We have enough problems with REACH without adding to them on a very small level . #% Are they just going to stand alone or are we actually going to see some action on them ? #% They were much cleverer , much more scheming than that . #% Parliament can bring its weight and views to bear in different ways and often with much greater flexibility . #% As we speak two ferries owned by P&O operating on the Dover/Calais route , an important connection between old and new Europe , are undergoing major refits in Germany . #% I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for all his efforts in steering this measure so swiftly and effectively through the committee . #% He is under-resourced and this is bringing the European Union into disrepute at present . #% To paraphrase William Shakespeare , I come not to bury radioactive waste but to praise nuclear energy : that is to say , to provide a reminder that nuclear energy is vitally important to European electricity and , therefore , our people must have great confidence in the safety standards applied to its generation . #% We are looking for action rather than words in this issue . #% So firstly , I should like to address Mrs de Palacio and secondly , Commissioner Schreyer . #% I think this is one of the key things they should be doing , and it would be interesting to know why certain Member States have not yet actually signed up to the relevant conventions and protocols . #% The splits that occurred in NATO and elsewhere in the lead-up to the Iraq war were a deliberate consequence of this policy . #% There is a feeling that some Members are beginning to doubt its utility because it always produces the same result . #% Possibly the most important founding principle of the European Union was peace and those who seek to join the Union must try to conduct their domestic and their foreign affairs in as peaceable a fashion as possible . #% Mr President , I wish particularly to emphasise the need to reimburse non-profit organisations or charities for the VAT they pay . #% A four-level regulatory approach and the creation of two more committees ! #% Then the 150 , 000 to 180 , 000 new jobs a year the Commission projects - the ambitious plans laid down in the Delors White Paper - will be much closer to becoming a reality . #% I am pleased to see that there is a gap in the agenda in the autumn for a further report from Mr Fabra Vallés . #% Does it have the political will ever to emerge as a partner with the United States ? #% The liberation of e-commerce is the element of any dynamic European economy of the future ; the counterbalance that has to be struck and which has to be fully realised is the effects it has on those who would use it as consumers . #% I will try to be brief . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by joining colleagues in condemning all human rights violations in Colombia , in expressing solidarity with the peasant farmers and indigenous peoples denied access to making a living off the land and to repeat the call we made in Colombia for justice for the 120 families forcibly evicted from their land at Bellacruz . #% Naturally , as you would expect from me as a leader of a party that puts national sovereignty above the integrationalist tendencies of the EU , I strongly object to this process of gradual integration . #% We need something to channel that debate into a set of conclusions that the IGC can work on . #% I am particularly happy to see what has occurred in Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . #% 
In my own country this would mean GBP 45 - 55 or EUR 70 - 90 per animal without any benefit in return and , as Mr Goodwill has already said , the scheme could have the effect of reducing the market price of certain categories of cattle , particularly of young bulls . #% There has been talk about capping the common agricultural policy and yet there has been no mention of how we are going to use the funding from Pillar One to Pillar Two . #% Finally , the call for a more simple procedure for logging complaints would simplify and demystify the complaints procedure for European citizens . #% Mr President , shortly before the summer break the Supreme Court of Indonesia finally acquitted all those military officers indicted for the unlawful killing of civilians in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor during the run-up to Timorese independence when there were attempts to derail the UN-led independence process . #% Since the PDB several things have happened , including the Council 's vote on its draft budget which is what we vote upon . #% I look forward to a further review of the uniform electoral procedure , by which time I trust that the Convention will have established the argument for regional seats in the larger States as well as for some element of a transnational list . #% Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens , not just in farms affected by ISA . #% This year 's report also sets out , for the first time , to provide readers with practical examples of the EU in action . #% I have no problem about telematics being included in such a programme and I generally support the Galileo project . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission and the Council , and I think we can rely on the Commissioner to take a very strong stand on these important issues . #% But the point is very strongly made by Hungarian Governments , Hungarian politicians and Hungarian people that Hungary has been part of Europe for ever and what it is seeking now is simply accession to the European Union . #% We are treated to terms like ` strategic objects ' , ` policy strategy ' , ` new directions ' , ` effective communications ' and ` genuine dialogues ' . #% All of us in Europe have an interest in helping to improve security , employment and living standards and resettling refugees and displaced persons in a part of our continent . #% I would hope that the House would agree on this occasion not to accept a verbal amendment . #% I thank Mr Manzella for that and we in the EPP Group will support his report . #% We would also have been more reassured if the resolution had included our concerns about the methodology which is being used to assess the risks of depleted uranium . #% One of the problems with agriculture is that we are not bringing young people back into it and one of the things we must do is move away from the constrictions of quotas . #% It is intended to harmonise Member States ' asylum policy and give more rights and privileges to those seeking asylum . #% We believe that one important means of encouraging people to take part in a period of worked-linked training in another Member State is to ensure that experience is validated and recognised across the European Union . #% I strongly oppose Mr Daul 's report on the sugar market which aims to extend the existing system , unchanged , until 2006 . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I support the report of the rapporteur and the work of the Commission . #% Under Rwandan law they have no rights to property or inheritance . #% We must have consistent interpretation by data protection commissioners that the IMEI number is not personal data - which it is regarded as in Germany . #% The Commission has made an effort in its SEPA roadmap of September 2009 . #% Finally , with regard to Cyprus , I agree there are strong possibilities for the two communities to reach a comprehensive settlement , but this requires goodwill and flexibility on sides and indeed pressure from the Commission on both sides . #% These concerns have arisen because of what the committee adopted . #% Mr President , I should like to return to the subject of the annual legislative programme , after that digression on the European budget . #% Mr Duisenberg , of course , enjoyed the support of Deutsche Bank in his fight for the presidency of the ECB . #% One point we must address : my country , the United Kingdom , is now suffering from the high pound on international currency exchange rates . #% I am sure the Mr Zappalà would agree with that . #% The destabilisation operation was financed by sections of private enterprise , frightened by the government 's radical programme of social reform and poverty alleviation and by its close association with the trade union movement . #% We certainly should not write in at this stage the requirement that these services must be managed on a ` not for profit ' basis . #% Since aspartame was also a source of this , all food products containing aspartame are clearly labelled to that effect , as the Commissioner said . #% This is folly and , say what you will , it is simply unacceptable . #% Within that rebate was hope of a payment from the social lines B3-4004 and B3-4003 . #% Should we not look at a less circus-like approach ? #% In conclusion , on these two items , we would like to see greater sensitivity on the part of the administration and the Bureau towards parliamentarians , because ultimately it is the Assembly that is sovereign . #% However , there are aspects of this report which could be misinterpreted or abused . #% We can not put economies in the European Union in that position and I do not believe that national parliaments will accept it . #% I will be putting questions to the Commission on this , but I must point out to my colleagues how illogical the situation is . #% President , this Parliament , by huge cross-party majorities , has made clear that it will no longer accept that animals should be made to suffer for the sake of developing yet more products to flatter human vanity . #% The key to achieving a satisfactory outcome to this problem must be the attainment of a political agreement between Parliament and the Council on a package of terms and conditions for Members of the European Parliament which are appropriate to the twenty-first century . #% I would only suggest to my colleagues that they should not be so over-sensitive . #% One of the issues that has concerned many of us is remuneration - when you can not determine what the length of an employment contract was - and issues regarding payment of national insurance and tax , which we know for many vulnerable workers are often taken out of their pay packets but not necessarily handed on to the authorities . #% Therefore , we can not support this proposal . #% We are concerned that while this is holding in the capital , there are still problems in the rural areas , with reports even today of tens of thousands of people fleeing into Monrovia from Totota in Central Liberia . #% Syria and Iran have also been extremely unhelpful in allowing Islamist fighters to infiltrate Iraq from their territories . #% Should there be an agency for human rights and democratisation ? #% We need to put more emphasis on peacekeeping and conflict prevention ; we need to put more emphasis on bringing other countries outside the European Union into conjunction with us . #% Finally , Amendment No 18 talks about annual training for cabin crews , including things like fire-fighting and the use of life rafts . #% I thoroughly concur with the Commissioner : when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been on delegations to various Member States and met its partner committees or European Affairs Committees in the national parliaments and asked them about their involvement in the national action plans - on employment or social inclusion , for example - it has received blank looks , because they have never heard of it : it is not something in which their government has involved them . #% I have also asked for risk-based flexibility in the application of certain measures so as to avoid unnecessary consequences for the poultry industry . #% No wonder Mugabe takes none of this seriously . #% If you look at the way we have used this power in the informal procedures that already exist , it is actually very unusual for parliaments to intervene and to blow the whistle . #% Such a common-sense and workable solution to the problems of football crime and disorder is long overdue . #% The ECR Group have nevertheless voted against this resolution for two specific reasons . #% These facilities should be seen very much as being at the heart of trying to achieve those economic goals . #% We must make sure that people understand the position in which the European Union has put itself . #% The risk capital action plan is not in itself a master plan for increased growth or job creation , but it is the essential framework . #% As long as the Commission is relatively satisfied , that really is an incredible outcome . #% Can I now call upon you first of all to ensure that the flag is immediately placed the right way up and also to take measures to ensure that in future it is always displayed correctly . #% So , I welcome what has been said today , but I do have some questions and , unusually for these sorts of debates , I would actually like some answers . #% They say turkeys do not vote for Christmas , but if the EU institutions vote for Turkey , it could be a serendipitous exception to the rule . #% The Treaty of Amsterdam gave a protocol giving a six-week period for ministers to discuss with their national parliaments . #% I welcome this first annual report by the Governor of the European Central Bank , Mr Duisenberg . #% The Commission and Parliament must be steadfast to support the deployment of so many European forces , not least at present in South Lebanon , as this exercise surely provides the greatest test for the development of our common foreign security and defence policy . #% 
a ) this should be left to member states to make appropriate arrangements #% Dr Rasha Al-Sabah , the long-serving Under-Secretary of Higher Education , is joined by Dr Fayezah Al-Khorafi , President of the University of Kuwait ; Her Excellency Nabila Al-Mulla , who is Ambassador of the State of Kuwait to Austria ; Siham Ruzuqi , the Assistant Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Oil ; another Assistant Under-Secretary : Sarah Duwaisan at the Ministry of Planning ; and in civil society : Shaikha Hussah Al-Salim Al-Mubarek Al-Sabah , the President of Dar Al-Athar Al-Islamiya , the Islamic Museum of Kuwait . #% In addition to the policy of target setting , the members of selection boards are reminded of the principles of equal opportunities to be taken into consideration in the selection of candidates . #% I particularly welcome also the reference in the report to the need for international cooperation drawing in other powers and partners . #% In fact , it was a very conciliatory letter but insisted on remaining with the code of practice of which I complained . #% Of course when duty-free goes , many of these bargains will go with it . #% These are areas where the Conservative Party has had a long-standing opposition to moving to the Community method . #% The Committee on Budgets needs to know a figure . #% These concerns will now multiply . #% The campaign was not free and fair because the media were biased . #% But medical science is making hope possible : early diagnosis , new drugs , specialist nurses , new therapies and knowledge leading to prevention . #% I had hoped , in the deliberations that Mr Bösch referred to within the JPC , that across our political divisions we would be able to temper some of the toughness of the strictures directed by the EU towards Slovakia . #% I ask those in this House who proclaim the glory of the Chechen freedom fighters how they account for the murder of innocent Muscovites ? #% May I remind my colleagues here today that Turkey has not used the death penalty in practice since 1984 . #% I choose six numbers every week and none of them ever comes up . #% Mr President , this is serious and I would ask you to look into it . #% I neither wish to deprive them of the political benefits nor drive the research from Europe to the Far East #% What everybody wants - whether they are farmers , citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union - is to feel that they have equal confidence , wherever they are , in the safety of the product that they are consuming . #% I particularly agree with the rapporteur 's recommendations in paragraph 11 that auditors should have a minimum level of compulsory insurance and be required to join a guarantee fund . #% I have corresponded with the President of our Parliament on this issue and she has written to me assuring me that this matter would be corrected and that the British flag would be flown the right way up . #% I think that Mr Cox 's approach is correct , but I would be interested to hear the Commissioner 's reaction to the question of how to make progress towards a definitive VAT system and how to recover VAT without undue cost and bureaucracy , to the question of the impact of telecoms liberalization on fiscal receipts - because this is a hugely growing market and the fiscal implications for chancellors really are very considerable . #% It is clear that companies and their employees still need some time to complete the learning process involved in establishing European works councils . #% So far as I am concerned it allows manufacturers to continue to produce engines which do not meet the highest air quality standards and perhaps to even put new ones on the market . #% Whilst thanking the President-in-Office for his reply , which is a very good one , will he bear in mind the fact that when we were considering in this House the Customs Union with Turkey , it was conveyed to many of us that , if that were approved , then Leyla Zana and other prisoners would automatically , in due course , be released . #% You were right . #% Here is a field where there is great potential for employment creation in the less-favoured regions . #% Would the Commissioner not agree that the Council , the Commission and those Members in this House who were foolish enough to vote for customs union , on the grounds that this would encourage Turkey to be more democratic , were pretty inept politically and tragically wrong ? #% Social inclusion , as has already been said , is a key component of a sustainable society , hence the need for a guaranteed minimum income to provide for basic needs . #% In the light of the information you have given us , Commissioner Bonino , I should like to know what finances you have been able to direct to the recurring crisis in Bangladesh , a country with which my own country , the United Kingdom , is very concerned and involved . #% I would urge all Members to come together to successfully conclude this legislation by moving forward as quickly as possible . #% We shall then vote for the amendments we supported in committee and for one further clarifying amendment which has been submitted since , but we shall oppose the amendments which we believe are a step too far in terms of what is desirable , practical and acceptable . #% I have just three very simple points to make in support of the position the rapporteur has taken . #% I ask Parliament to support my proposals , to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic . #% We must also be very careful not to whip up racist prejudice and we look forward to proposals based on Article 13 to combat racism . #% Tourists who unfortunately fall ill are suddenly taken from their hotel and deflected to private hospitals where they are then landed with a hefty bill . #% I urge the Commission to compile data on the impact of all these diseases on children and women . #% We should stick to the same formula that we have already adopted so as to have consistency in the text . #% The careful balance the Commissioner mentioned needs to be made very carefully , but we need facts and details on how the human rights situation throughout the world is being handled . #% This was reflected in the unanimous vote in our committee . #% It is through criminal intention , implicit approval and gross negligence that such large-scale human rights abuse has been permitted to take place . #% These three proposals : the agreement , the directive on seafarers ' hours and the ILO Convention are designed to come into effect together in mid-2002 . #% Thirdly , reference has been made to quotas . #% This House should reject this proposal . #% We need to ensure that all our citizens have access to high-quality screening programmes , diagnosis and treatment , including palliative care . #% It is also a confrontation over Côte d'Ivoire 's most valuable asset , cocoa . #% I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament . #% This is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement . #% When the leaders of the European countries sit down with the Americans and other allies there is a remarkable unanimity . #% Only 42 % of West Bank territory is controlled by the Palestinians , 58 % is either in military camps or settlements and too often the military camps lead to the settlements . #% It does not introduce a separate regime for the institutions - indeed , it can not . #% I have no doubt they take their responsibilities very seriously , and we should welcome the action of the Slovak government in inviting an independent panel of experts to inspect this plant . #% The Commission says it is taking it very seriously , but that is not good enough : we want an explicit endorsement . #% Obviously , I regret that the Commission is rather less than ambitious in its programmes of democratisation , and we hope to see that improve in the coming months . #% But as always we want that to be balanced by solidarity and social inclusion . #% Clearly serious health risks are very slight for the vast majority but for a few they are very real . #% I support the thrust of the amendments by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz , in particular with regard to the need for proper coordination between the fund 's activities and projects financed under Community structural programmes : with regard to ensuring that assistance from the fund is additional to and not a substitute for other public expenditure ; with regard to pursuing objectives that are consistent with the peace fund programme and with regard to ensuring that appropriate measures are taken by the Commission to publicize the Community participation in the activities of the fund . #% I fear these two precedents on 29 April . #% This is not serious . #% I made the point that the language of the budget is probably the twelfth language in this institution . #% We want to make sure that EU research initiatives complement market-driven research , thereby avoiding conflict or duplication . #% We think this is a good amendment because it gets right to the point . #% I say to the two Commissioners present today and to Members of the House that we only need to look at what the Council is proposing on the budget for Info 2000 and on the information society to see that the Council 's support for information technology does not even stretch to maintaining the budget lines that are necessary for the coming year to really develop information technology for the European Union . #% Mr President , despite attempts to make them otherwise , security and defence are matters for the European Council . #% I would like to place on the record our thanks as a Parliament for his work for public health over the last five years , particularly in the area of mental health and the way he has ensured that this issue has risen up the agenda . #% I propose that , while the rest of the debate takes place this afternoon , the actual vote be postponed until the Brussels part-session in two weeks ' time . #% Plainly , in the single market it is not and should not be . #% 
While there must be no relaxation whatsoever of the embargo on military supplies to Iraq , if arrangements could be reached to lift sanctions on other supplies , which are hurting the population more than Saddam , in return for the stabilization of Kurdish autonomy , this would be a very important step forward . #% But it has had the recent good fortune of Mr Zapatero 's new socialist government coming to power in Spain . #% Following the arrest of Mr Riad al-Turk , a 72 year-old lawyer and secretary-general of the banned Communist Party , there are suggestions that Syria might be about to enter a new phase of repression , following a gradual thawing of relations with the West and a desirable but limited opening-up of the Syrian economy to market forces . #% I have just returned from Washington as an ad hoc member of the US delegation . #% If this does not succeed , some states will press ahead and a two-speed EU will emerge . #% The reason is quite simple . #% We have looked at this further in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and it is especially of concern in the case of multicentre trials where administrative procedures can lead to extensive delays and confusion even before the commencement of the trial . #% It is mainly based outside the Union , but it is attacking our citizens and can cross internal frontiers inside the Union with total facility . #% Mr President , I speak on behalf of the British Conservative delegation at a time when a war is being fought in Iraq - on all our behalves - to remove a threat to our own people and to lift a tyrant from the backs of the Iraqis . #% We face competing pressures on the budget and I would hope that this Parliament will remain faithful to the view that Darfur should not drop out of our set of priorities at this crucial time . #% In my opinion , from the mid 1990s until 2000 the Equitable Life Assurance Society over-bonused its with-profit policies , which showed on paper at least that Equitable Life had the best results of all major assurance companies , thus encouraging people to take Equitable Life policies out . #% There are many others . #% Indeed , the trialogue process , it can be argued , has been more transparent than a conciliation process , in which only final texts of negotiations are published . #% The concerns expressed by the House have been eliminated largely because of the agreement and the good work that has gone into it . #% It seems to me that he wants to neuter the organisation before it begins . #% My group , the ECR Group , strongly believes that properly structured new EU financial instruments are therefore essential . #% Why has a decision not been taken immediately ? #% Since then the security situation has deteriorated catastrophically . #% There is massive interdependence between farming and its rural infrastructure . #% Levies on pesticides will fall heavily on the new expensive products , which by and large cause less ecological concern than some of the older , cheaper , off-patent products . #% Road transport enforcement is carried out by a variety of agencies , most of which have multiple responsibilities and duties . #% It is a catastrophic violation of individual private property . #% No , you rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty but you could not stop the Irish from voting , and the Irish said ` no ' . #% Of course , resources must be targeted where needed , but investigation needs to happen at the time of suspicion , not after the event . #% I say that subject to one proviso , and an important one : against that background the rules of the single market should apply in their entirety . #% Was it you ? #% The flaw lay in the approach to the soft bull bar . #% This is a bigger step for Europe and the European Parliament as it confirms its maturity . #% We must also remember that the Ombudsman is the other great defender of citizens ' rights . #% EU membership still remains a political football , which is not the best way to prepare for full membership of the European Union . #% We demand her immediate release and that of all political prisoners , which would be a major step towards the restoration of democracy . #% We want to see these things implemented in the three-year target period that he has set for himself . #% European society is changing and the interest in the situation of families and its implications for employment and social policy has been expressed in different forums . #% Clearly , paragraph 2 's stout defence of the Commission 's stance in rejecting renationalisation would differ from my own view , as we have already discussed . #% We need to be steadfast in the face of terrorism . #% I do not think any of the parliamentarians have any doubt at all about her passionate personal commitment towards trying to secure a positive outcome from the talks in Bonn , and I would also like to say a word of thanks to my Liberal colleague , Prime Minister Verhofstadt , for the emphasis he placed this morning on saying that the problem of climate change is the greatest single challenge facing the planet . #% US policies are not saving lives : they are only pandering to the fundamentalist conservative voters at home . #% You were kind enough to refer to my own report , which hopefully will be on the agenda at the next part-session . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the President-in-Office said that the new unity government in Palestine had not quite passed the litmus test . #% I refute that we are scrapping the human rights issue . #% Finally , I do not understand the 90-animal limit because surely extensification , greening the agricultural policy is the way forward . #% I am convinced that a reasonable , acceptable deal can be found on the bulk of the points , but there is one that seems to be extraordinarily difficult : the system of voting in the Council . #% Though time forbids me , Mr President , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House , I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas . #% In Council , too , we have seen an increasing willingness to approach this reform with some spirit , which I know was not shared by all Members back in 1999 when I first met with representatives and Member States in Helsinki . #% In doing so , I would like to point out a particular problem for my own country that might mitigate against support for additional spending . #% That was a direct reference to the British Government . #% We therefore desperately need to ensure that short sea shipping is promoted to enable the EU to fulfil its international obligations . #% This Parliament has repeatedly gone on record against the human rights abuses for which the Indonesian Government has been responsible . #% A productive single market of the 21st century will be our children 's inheritance , their jobs and prosperity . #% At the same time we condemn the kidnapping of the captured Israeli soldier and we call for his swift and safe release . #% The passing on of contaminated blood can and does have fatal consequences and I welcome strongly the proposals to regulate the transportation of blood and to ensure supervision by qualified staff , which represent an important step forward in this directive . #% Furthermore , in line with the Article 13 Action Programme on Anti-Discrimination , I have called for subsidies for the expenses for special events at European level to go up from `` not exceeding 80 % '' to `` not exceeding 90 % '' . #% Should it be a small group of out-of-touch politicians dictating what makes a better quality of life for the people , or should it be the millions of workers themselves , who currently enjoy the right to choose and who want to continue to decide for themselves ? #% It is going , in fact , to be extremely hard with regard to some of the requirements , but it strikes a satisfactory balance between the protection of the environment on the one hand and society 's need for a reliable and secure source of power at an affordable price , which is something we can not ignore . #% We need this national plan to ensure that the momentum that supports European integration in Turkey does not diminish . #% It was the pivotal point where economic and monetary union went from simply being an aspiration of the European Union to becoming a reality . #% At this stage there is not only Leyla Zana , important as she is , but there are many other Kurdish prisoners who are in a like condition . #% At that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children , the most vulnerable section of our society . #% I am also glad that we call in this report for the Americans to close down Guantanamo Bay . #% The main plank of our air quality strategy in this area is the national emission ceilings and , as long as they are met , Member States should have a degree of flexibility . #% It seems that there is no rule by which we can ask people who are invading the privacy of Members of this House to leave Parliament . #% This year alone , 190 million more of the highest-value banknotes in the world will hit our streets , and a suitcase full of these is worth seven times as much as a suitcase filled with 100-dollar bills . #% Often the money which the EU spends does not reach the fishermen or the countries for which it is intended . #% The wide-ranging nature of the final text and the safeguards it provides for consumers ' rights are a tribute to her negotiating skills . #% It is a dialogue with the deaf . #% Mr President , the British Conservatives i.e. the European Democrats do not support the idea that the proposed European Union constitution as discussed currently at the IGC in Rome is merely a tidying-up exercise . #% 
We mentioned in the debate the issue of an adequate income for older people . #% It will involve matters that have to do with the EU 's regional and environmental policy . #% Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee , including voting records and reasoning , are now published after about 6 weeks . #% What we are supposed to get there is the nitty-gritty detail as well . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , perhaps first we could send our good wishes to Commissioner Dimas and wish him a speedy recovery . #% So it can benefit all of us and we must take an interest . #% After consideration of existing legislation , be it on IPPC , landfill or Seveso , and in each case I have acted as the rapporteur at different stages of development of that legislation , it is clear that none of them can provide a comfortable solution to the range of problems presented by mining operations . #% The campaign happens every year and more than six million leaflets are printed and distributed across Europe , along with advertisements in the press , and we also get some television and video spots . #% Parliament must not be seen as another hoop that the Commission and the Council must jump through , but instead as a serious and equal player in the process . #% We can not assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen . #% The EU 's character is going to change very dramatically , particularly with the accession of the Central and East European countries . #% Obviously , a lot also needs to be done by the Member States -- preferably through intergovernmental cooperation -- to work towards more energy efficiency , to develop more technologies in the form of renewables , but also to interconnect their electricity grids in a pan-European system , which will drive down prices and allow spare capacity . #% India 's future growth is dependent on meeting spiralling energy needs . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this debate clearly follows on from our resolution last October on Arctic governance . #% And their prospects ? #% It is to urge the Commission to produce its communication on fair trade which can act as a base for new legislation ; for global research which can bring direct support to developing fair trade networks in the south as well as fair trade principles in the north ; to support in principle a separate budget line ending the necessity of using NGO co-financing monies which are often not appropriate for producer cooperatives within the developing world ; to end European discrimination against fair trade in fiscal terms , bringing forward preferential treatment which is compatible with the WTO because of the voluntary nature of the labels ; and finally , to recognize the dangers of the proliferation of labels and the need to have a serious dialogue about the link between fair trade and the new ethical trading being promoted through codes of conduct , on which I am drawing up a report for the Committee on Development and Cooperation . #% Whilst I am on my feet , Madam President , I would like to refer back to earlier this morning when you were in the chair . #% We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of agrochemicals , its diversion of rivers and its poor drainage system . #% Fresh information has come to light since the hearing in The Sunday Times this weekend which casts further doubt on whether Mr Busquin was truthful in his answers to Parliament . #% I would like to press the Commissioner a little further . #% The EU prides itself on inserting these human rights clauses into trade agreements . #% There is indeed a clinic in Romania that supplies the UK market . #% We , as a parliament , want to make sure that accountability is seen to work for those who elected us and to make sure that we have value for money in the running of the programmes . #% As someone who represents London , with its strong insurance sector , and in particular as someone who worked for several years for Lloyd 's of London , I appreciate what a significant single market achievement this is , based on the recognised principles of licensing home state control and mutual recognition . #% Is there an error in some respect in the title or is the report broader than that ? #% Politically it is clearly intended to undermine the nation state , and thus it threatens democracy in Europe . #% We thank you for all you have done and I thank Mr Hernández Mollar and other colleagues on the committee for everything they have done over the last few years . #% The rebate took to negotiate . #% We have requested this debate for two particular reasons which we wish to highlight . #% The rapporteur has worked hard and I am therefore particularly sorry to say that my Liberal Group can not unfortunately support most of his amendments . #% It is an unusual process but one in which Parliament has to give the message from its consultation that the Brussels Convention must not merely be transformed into a regulation it has to be brought up-to-date to meet the needs of the contemporary world . #% Those who seek re-election will no doubt be seeking to justify themselves on the basis of their record and new entrants will be of course arguing that they are better alternatives . #% There is no justification either for any argument in favour of transferring funds from Asia to Latin America , especially when we know about the desperate poverty of 800 million people in Asia . #% We can not get involved in the negotiations but the most important thing we can do - and I hope the House will agree - is to give strong support to the EU negotiating team and say to the Americans : ` come on , sign up , we need this agreement ' . #% Frankly , the leaders of the four main groups should be ashamed of themselves for the way they have behaved . #% In other words , we are potentially giving preferential access to flags of convenience . #% It would be helpful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter when he responds to the debate . #% The epidemic moved with terrifying speed . #% While recognising that a border dispute with Slovenia remains outstanding , we do not think that bilateral disputes can be allowed to delay Croatia 's membership . #% Why not reveal the questions to the public , why not to the petitioners ? #% It is a compromise . #% Focusing on issues which affect people 's daily lives , such as food safety , the euro and justice and home affairs , will ensure that citizens fully engage in the debate about Europe . #% Very few politicians will wish to speak out against such proposals , for fear that their words may be misinterpreted , but there is some concern that the link between the use of phthalates in toys and a risk to children has not been firmly established . #% I join with the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking him for his work . #% In my view , the consequences of postponement would be entirely negative : a slap in the face rather than encouragement ; a bad signal to the Bulgarian people . #% However , as President Prodi himself rightly indicated , there is still much room for improvement , and we would like to highlight three areas in which we consider that the document presented to us today is still seriously lacking . #% Firstly , we must resist the pressure for a narrow round of debate , wherever that comes from . #% Following the adoption of a resolution by this House on the situation in Turkish prisons , I wrote to the Turkish authorities drawing particular attention to the request that Members of this Parliament should visit Turkish prisons to see the situation for themselves . #% Therefore , by calling for the funding in these areas , the committee is showing an awareness of the importance of these modern-day issues . #% It will be a sovereign decision of this House to decide whether we can apply urgent procedure to this report . #% The statement by Botswana on behalf of those groups said very clearly that the revised texts fell far short of their expectations . #% Mr President , it is clear that in our European Union today changes are underway , particularly in the Commission , as a result of the refusal to give discharge for the 1996 budget and then the consequent and ultimate mass resignation of the Commission . #% Can you appeal to Mr Denktash to reopen negotiations urgently and accept that the huge swing against him in the election indicates a desire by his impoverished people for a settlement on the island ? #% That is why Sinn Féin , in particular , has to break the wall of silence so that it can set its community free . #% I hope it will be implemented without excessive difficulty , particularly for SMEs , at a cost that will not threaten the competitiveness of our industry . #% The report asks the Commission to undertake several activities . #% I would suggest therefore that , before leaping into the usual role of telling everyone else what is going wrong , the Commission this time spends its time examining why , when the chips were down , it performed so badly . #% As other speakers have already done , I should like to congratulate our two main rapporteurs , Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg . #% It is a pity that the EU as such is not represented in the UN system , so that the Commission and Parliament are only observers , although the President-in-Office did a very good job . #% It is up to this House to decide - as for every other interinstitutional agreement - by a simple majority whether to add this as an Annex to our Rules of Procedure , without changing the Rules of Procedure . #% It is much better to leave this on one side for now and see how the directive begins to work and come back to this in the future . #% Collectively , your terminology wipes out patentability throughout huge areas of technology , not just programming . #% It is now clear that all Commissioners are on probation and we should be paying particular attention to Neelie Kroes in her role as Competition Commissioner , as her previous job as a lobbyist could well bring about a conflict of interest . #% Whilst the EPLP believes that this is an extremely important opinion that raises many relevant points in trying to develop a Europe-wide solution linking to pollution to consumption , the EPLP believes that taxation is a matter of national competence and therefore can not support aims at harmonising taxation at an EU level to reach these aims without full unanimity . #% I noticed that when he last visited Parliament , he asked MEPs to try to find out and spread the word in their Member States to gain awareness of what was happening . #% That is the real agenda . #% 
Open media can be intrusive and the problem with the Internet today is that we have to find a way of dealing with the various segments within which its operations take place . #% We also fully support conclusion 5 of the report , which stresses the need for an holistic approach towards asylum and immigration looking at this as a horizontal policy objective and considering all policy areas , particularly those with an external dimension , such as trade , development , environment and agriculture . #% My concern is two-fold : first , the extent of redundancy in the text -- there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect , but I do not consider that this is one of them ; secondly , the range of issues covered -- I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them . #% The majority BNP Government , in power since 2001 , has particular problems with economic reform as it is often blocked by political in-fighting and corruption . #% I would therefore be extremely grateful if the Commissioner will be able to confirm this to the House now , since it is an important and crucial point to Members . #% I agree so far with the measures taken and I fully agree to the postponement of the report . #% We are delighted to see that is one of the 50 of 62 amendments which were accepted by the Commission and the Council . #% The most important source of revenue is expected to be royalties from intellectual property rights . #% Mr President , I also would to thank our rapporteur . #% Freedom of information ought to be a summit priority and so should ratification of the international criminal court and pursuing perpetrators of crimes against humanity . #% Mr President , I celebrate the fact that this report brings nearer the prospect of safer car fronts and therefore fewer pedestrian , cyclist and motorcyclist deaths . #% The fact that we are , I hope , bringing this matter to a speedy conclusion is testimony to her hard work . #% Secondly , I call upon the Romanian Government to reconsider its absolute ban on inter-country adoptions . #% Listening to them I now understand the concept of the big lie . #% I just wonder , Madam President-in-Office , whether people in history will remember the Belgian presidency of the year 2001 as the presidency that oversaw the demise of Europe 's civil aviation industry . #% I invite you to say that an inspection visit will be made , possibly from your department , from the Financial Controller and from the Court of Auditors . #% Many old sites are literally centuries old and have developed in such a way that they are now sites of scientific interest and contain particular flora and fauna . #% Firstly , I would cite the common foreign and security policy where we have a much clearer definition of what we gained in the interinstitutional agreement . #% All I am saying is that we , as the Committee on Budgets , should take the necessary steps to ensure that we have some allowance and that we will consider the figures in the next few months . #% One important aspect and , indeed , a prior condition to making progress on the career structure is that we must reach agreement on a multiannual framework governing movements in unit wage costs allowing the institutions , Parliament , the Commission and the Council to set a robust and structured framework for developing the careers of their staff . #% It is important that we deal with this matter . #% Certainly we all have to do our best to make it true . #% On his behalf , I present this to you . #% The minister also said to me : we can not pay ; we do not have the money to man all these crossings ! #% Therefore , their consolidation into a single general clause is clear , simple and straightforward . #% In another arena that would be called fraud and it is shameful that the UK has the worst record of late payments in Europe at a dismal average of 23 days . #% Otherwise those things we have tried to achieve on the issue of human rights and freedom of expression will be seriously undermined . #% That was an excellent , very helpful reply . #% Women are still genitally mutilated , human beings stoned to death , their limbs chopped off in the name of law . #% But certainly the absence of the US pushed the European Union into the front line . #% The província esquecida , or forgotten province of Portugal , as it was then known , conjured up a picture of a beautiful , remote Pacific island , an exotic mix of East and West producing a unique Catholic cultural heritage . #% We have been at this for years . #% I also want to know what will prevent troops from Muslim countries like Malaysia and Bangladesh , which do not recognise the State of Israel , from turning a blind eye to the rearmament of Hizbollah . #% He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner . #% Recycling , re-use and ultimate disposal are not cheap and not free . #% At the end there is a list of things that the Commission and Council want to bring back to us . #% The Party of European Socialists welcomes and supports the amendments from the committee which underline the need for an ecological basis for fish stock management in the Antarctic Sea and for all nations fishing in the area to take responsibility for control of their vessels and their catches . #% We need to rescue the hungry and vulnerable , support moves to bring political stability , but also respect the various traditions of those five Somali nations so that they can come together through these conferences to live as neighbours in peace and prosperity . #% Whatever the arguments about the budgets , they pay and then argue about how it is all to be spent , which is not real budgeting in any sense that I understand . #% The European Parliamentary Labour Party is pleased to have been able to inject a degree of balance and impartiality into this report , which was severely lacking in the first draft presented to Committee . #% When Members are speaking in debate , either in committee or in plenary , they should declare an interest , but that should not prevent them from voting on a subject . #% He has probably received , as I have , a number of letters from the Additives Survivors ' Network , who relate pretty grim stories of the adverse consequences of salt of aspartame for some of them . #% My Group supports the common position with some exceptions , and they will all make themselves heard in this debate . #% Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process , and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change . #% Therefore the majority view of the Socialist Group is that the common position should be adopted unamended . #% I would like to isolate four points which are of particular significance . #% Either we are serious about building up a genuine Europe , embracing all the countries which were separated from western Europe for 40 years by an accident of history , which we must ensure never happens again , and take steps that we know are necessary to make that possible , or a majority of this Parliament votes for amendments calling for subsidies we know are unsustainable and betray this historic moment of change . #% We are in a serious situation , not least because this is a nuclear state and the risk of a failed nuclear state is one that should make us all feel very nervous indeed . #% These proposed rules are throwing their businesses into turmoil . #% They should not be forced to buy professional advice they neither need nor want . #% We in this House respect human rights and cultural diversity . #% Whilst I would like to demand that the ECB take note of what the Court of Auditors has said , I could have used this report to attack the ECB and got great headlines for myself back home , but that was not the role of the rapporteur . #% That has significant implications for the whole question of immunities and it explains why we are in the present muddle . #% I urge the Commissioner to involve this House fully . #% Does the rapporteur have evidence of the FDA 's inadequacy and the inadequacy of its own assessment ? #% Amendment 4 concerns gender balance and the governing and management structures of the Agency . #% I was honoured to produce the opinion from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . #% I want to state , however , that , contrary to popular opinion , this is not exclusively a problem brought about by intensive agriculture . #% But I would like to start doing something in preparation this year . #% Allow me to remind the Commission that it has a Treaty obligation , under Article 197 , to answer questions posed by Parliament . #% It was a judgment made , not by a small majority of judges in that body , but by a vote of 15 to 2 , a very large majority , in favour of the principle that in terms of human rights , citizens of Gibraltar should be able to vote in European elections . #% Thanks to Parliament 's insistence we have also reached compromise on the ability of national authorities to delegate approval of prospectuses to stock exchanges and others such as the nominated advisors in the aim market . #% Passenger safety and security are of paramount importance and , as such , I hope that the Commission 's forthcoming proposal will reflect our strong stance . #% We all recognise that , while much has been done to promote human rights within the European Union , there is still scope to improve . #% That said , we need to ensure that aid is channelled through trusted organisations and we need to offer the leadership a road map for reform . #% At the same time , on the markets in northern Ghana , there was US-subsidised rice and EU-processed tomato products , cheaper than the local produce . #% 
Taiwan is a prosperous democracy with a top-quality public health system . #% Yet we have been told that a soft landing is all we can hope for in Hong Kong . #% If colleagues in this House start quoting the poisonous drivel from The Sun and attributing it , however indirectly as Mr Macartney was doing , to the actions of a party they oppose , that is dangerous . #% There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared . #% In a couple of weeks ' time , Parliament will send an ad hoc delegation to Kosovo to try and make an assessment . #% It concerns corporate social responsibility . #% Just look around the shelves in supermarkets and see what is claimed on so many products , including an increasing range of sweets and confectionery -- some of those claims are frankly absurd . #% This is an extremely important issue for Parliament to try to ensure that taxpayers ' money is managed and supervised correctly within the Member States . #% The first is that it introduces uniform test standards for plastic fuel tanks ; that covers all types of motor vehicles , both cars and commercial vehicles . #% Could the Commissioner , in response to my supplementary , give a firmer commitment to actually quantify the assistance we give ? #% We were told that it would be restricted to just four subjects and now it is clear that the agenda is wide open . #% Perhaps I could highlight some of the issues which we would like the Council and Commission to consider . #% In this morning 's , the leader of the UK 's Liberal Democrats , Sir Menzies Campbell , said that Britain 's extradition arrangements with the USA were a constitutional disgrace . #% If colleagues from Limburg would like to come and talk to me about our experience in the West Midlands , we can show you the programmes we have put in place , not just to retrain and redeploy people , but also to help those smaller companies in the supply chain affected by changes in production . #% My Group welcomes the latest decision by the Commission to launch a campaign to inform passengers of their rights - something which the airlines in particular have failed to do over many years . #% Why have nine Member States , including Germany , Ireland , and Portugal , failed to sign the UN optional protocol against torture ? #% ( Applause from the PSE Group ) As for the problems , the sensitive issues which Mrs Oomen-Ruijten talks about will still be there in June . #% That does not represent British people 's views ; that is not Europe 's attitude towards Islam . #% I can fully understand their reasons for joining NATO , where governments cooperate together , but the EU that they joined last weekend is about to become a different EU in just six weeks ' time , because with the Constitution comes a new legal order . #% The directive is also right to mention the role that consumers must also play in disposing of electrical waste . #% Nor does it recognise the changing way in which wine is distributed , marketed or consumed , especially in northern Europe . #% Finally , under an opt-in regime , people might opt to receive mailings from organisations that could be embarrassing for them , such as gay organisations when they did not wish to come out , or they could be open to malicious abuse . #% The majority of herds that have experienced BSE in the UK have had only one or two isolated cases . #% I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report . #% It is quite clear that the situation is deteriorating in Turkey and we must all deeply regret the action the military have taken . #% If and when Mr Dimas replies to the debate , I would like to ask him to give us some up-to-date news on exactly how Natura 2000 is progressing . #% Commissioner , I think now is the time for Parliament and the Commission , along with Member States , to really pull together to establish the tax incentives and get everything in place so that we can deliver a very good biofuel/biomass policy for Europe . #% I know that the Commission is very keen that we have these benchmarks , and I wonder if the Council supports this view . #% What about the other twelve Member States ? #% Parliament should amend the proposal in order to reflect the diversity of those markets . #% I hope that this afternoon the Commissioner , whom I greatly respect , as indeed I do Commissioner Bolkestein , will now at long last give us a straight answer to a straight question . #% Quite clearly we are entering a very dangerous time : we have two years in which to get this right , to measure the value of equivalence and reach convergence with countries around the world . #% The amendment sets a realistic , but urgent date of 2005 for that . #% Other parts of this report , which state that proof of adequate retirement cover is a prerequisite for third-country nationals obtaining some rights or the same rights , are equally subjective . #% All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive . #% They are the backbone of their future . #% In conjunction with these changes , Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly . #% Another EU import tariff scheme has come unstuck : recently sugar , now bananas , and all for pan-EU harmony . #% I ask you if this is a cause for concern and I can assure you that these negotiations have to be continued and concluded in a most positive and constructive way , indeed , in your own words - and I wrote them down , ' for an agreement which fulfils the aspirations and interests of both parties ' and one reflecting the view that South Africa certainly deserves special consideration in this matter . #% Furthermore , I should like to echo Mrs Maij-Weggen 's very important point . #% Several thousand people have died and hundreds have been arrested . #% We have drawn on research from around the world , and my report looks at the following issues : engagement with parents , which is very important for early years for young children ; staff and the quality of services and qualifications required ; and integrating early years services with the rest of the education systems in Member States . #% It is an attempt to subvert democracy and filibuster to a degree which is ludicrous . #% I will not mention all of them ( the House will be pleased to know ) . #% The crisis in Niger this year is not exceptional ; for many people , the hunger they now face is only a slight worsening of what they see every year . #% Despite this long delay , there was further incompetence , dare I say , within the Secretariat because the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy under Mrs Flesch as the rapporteur had produced some very useful amendments to the report which only came to the Committee on Employment after we had voted on the report . #% In a similar vein , making insurance purchase easier and more competitive , by enabling citizens to get their insurance claim records delivered to them wherever they have had insurance previously , so that they can use their past clean record to gain important price and coverage benefits for their insurance is an important benefit . #% In competition policy and internal market rules we need an amendment to the merger regulation to include considerations related to employment and social rights and the inclusion , for example , of social clauses in the public procurement framework . #% Mr van Velzen wants to make one suggestion , and that is on the division of competences within the Commission . #% Culture has not come out of the budget process as well as it wished , but we are doing rather better than the Council of Ministers ' proposal and have figures close to the 1999 level . #% Therefore , all the changes we propose must have the consent of the people . #% I ask Parliament , Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem . #% Mr President , it saddens me that back in 1999 I made my maiden speech in the European Parliament on East Timor , shortly before the United Nations sent in a peacekeeping force which paved the way for its eventual independence . #% National politicians do not get credit for fighting crime outside their own countries . #% Therefore , it is absolutely unnecessary to question the validity of the conclusion of the European Union 's independent scientific committee - the SCF - that aspartame is a substance safe for human consumption . #% The Nice Summit might have been a halting step forward in terms of efficiency , but it is a serious step backward in terms of legitimacy and transparency as far as the conduct of the EU 's trade policy is concerned . #% Madam President , Mr Prodi has mentioned the competitiveness of European industry in the course of his introductory remarks . #% We have removed some of the health claim anomalies -- not least , may I say , on light ale , which no more claimed that people would become light than a cough sweet claims that people will cough . #% The priorities are also stated as being the new staff management policy , a policy that the Secretary-General has outlined very clearly both to Parliament and to the staff . #% The state of affairs there appals many Pakistanis , both within the country and throughout the world , people who are proud of their religious faith and who are also committed to fundamental human rights . #% We have seen rigged elections in Armenia and Azerbaijan , while in Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev has flouted the country 's constitution and cowed the opposition . #% The PPE part of the PPE-DE Group is in favour of discharge for the agencies for numerous reasons , many of which I do not understand , considering in general terms that the state of the Commission 's accounts is just a pile of pants I am using colloquialisms to give the interpreters a test at this time in the evening . #% I should like to personally thank the President-in-Office for his efforts in this matter . #% The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through , for the benefit of all Zimbabweans . #% In a news bulletin of 24 October , the Chinese Government said that it was an internal affair for China and that we had no right to interfere . #% The budget is not enough . #% 
He was actually referring to an extremely important issue which is covered by Rule 166 . #% Their use is indeed wide-spread and the activities in which they have a role are many and various , so we have sought to set new , stronger limits on their emission in a whole range of larger industrial installations . #% With the Commission now taking it to court over the breaches of the stability and growth pact , Germany is effectively hoisted by its own petard . #% What part of the word ` no ' do you not understand ? #% At the same time , I call upon the Likud Party to remove all references in its manifesto to its claims that the West Bank is an integral and perpetual part of the State of Israel . #% Mr Tindemans ' report on a common security policy for the EU contains some unacceptable elements . #% Services will be reduced as potential competitors cherry-pick only the profitable areas of business , meaning less development in the sector . #% Is Mr Byrne satisfied that the European Union already has the capacity to monitor effectively any signs that an animal epidemic , or a major human pandemic , has started to occur here , given the likelihood of concealment ? #% Mr President , continuing with the ratification procedure in the remaining Member States would have the attraction of showing that this Constitution does have the support of the majority of Member States and of the peoples of the European Union . #% Otherwise such payments amount to nothing more than financing terrorism . #% We also welcome the general call for a tax review for reductions in fiscal and social security burdens plus red tape , all of which increase unemployment and bear down on jobs . #% Special offer fares of around GBP 16 are available to all citizens of the European Union for day trips . #% If the medicines available to us are restricted , then again it is the animal that suffers . #% There is thus no guarantee that payment will be made . #% Our citizens expect Europe to make them secure . #% Mr President , I would like to propose the following oral amendment : ` Calls upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and to release him unless he is to be charged with a recognised criminal offence ; similarly calls for the release of Chen Guangcheng , who has helped citizens in their attempts to sue their local authorities for carrying out forced abortions and sterilisations , and of Bu Dongwei , who has been assigned to two and a half years of `` Re-education through Labour '' ( RTL ) and who is detained at an undisclosed location ; therefore urges the authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders can carry out peaceful and legitimate activities without fear of arbitrary arrest , torture or ill-treatment and that they be given access to proper legal representation in the event of arrest ; ' . #% All you need do is ask for the version with the signatures of the various signatories from the different groups that combined in this joint resolution . #% These agencies are generally already used to working within a regulated framework . #% This is the fourth time running I have been here to listen to his presentation . #% However , I am concerned in particular that we do not have the support of port workers themselves . #% Introducing the marriage issue distracts from the real priority , to which Liberals are absolutely committed , which is to give legal recognition to same-sex and unmarried partnerships : that really is a matter of fundamental rights . #% The amendment seems to be against stevia and wants another investigation of that . #% Mr President , you have given me the floor as rapporteur but in fact the name on the report is that of Mrs Damião . #% But my key point is that even if tough new rules are adopted tomorrow , as we hope , this should not be seen as a green light to lift the de facto moratorium . #% No date has been set for an end to export subsidies . #% I would just like to ask the President-in-Office if he will agree with the main conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry , in particular those that relate to the role that computerization can play in preventing the loss by fraud of excise duty to Member States and own resources to the European Union budget ? #% On Monday evening the Socialist Group expressed a reservation about one of the candidates . #% The Institutional Committee then drafts a report on this report , and we end up debating a year and a half later the events of a year and a half before on the basis of a report on a report . #% It is predicted that 250 000 will die in the European Union of these diseases in the next 35 years . #% The pioneers sought to make a peaceful Europe and they , of course , succeeded . #% We have two very modest requests of the budget which are contained within the Buitenweg report . #% If we catch them early and apply the appropriate health measures , we can make an enormous saving on the health care budgets of the fifteen Member States in which this currently accounts for 8 % . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner what actions he has taken to persuade the US to abandon its embargo on the sale of medicines , which are cheap for the US to produce ? #% This state of affairs explains in part why the government of President Ben Ali has had to impose a rather tough regime , which falls well short of the standards we would enjoy in the EU . #% Secondly , the abolition of the definition of international shuttle services , which never existed in national legislation , will , again , greatly clarify matters . #% There is also the joke about the tourist who , lost in depths of Ireland , asked a local how to get to Tipperary and he was told ' I would not start from here ' . #% The visits to the UK and the Netherlands allowed us to listen to everyone who was affected . #% These institutions may appear to be mutually exclusive , whereas in fact both `` sides '' could learn a lot from one another and work more effectively in unison . #% The move to the third generation is going to open up new markets for small and large businesses . #% Its reactionary proposals appear to want to move away from QMV to permanent unanimity on the financial perspectives , and also to remove Parliament 's right of assent . #% The House will know that the most important political points in the discussions on this early retirement scheme that have so far taken place in the Council and in Parliament relate to the fact that the proposed scheme only concerns the Commission , which is committed to implementing the scheme in a budgetary neutral way . #% Nevertheless , would you not agree that since the unanimous confirmation of the safety of the date-based export scheme , provided you personally endorse it in this House , as I hope you will , there is a very limited area for clarification of what more can be done . #% It is right to stress this point again tonight . #% We must remember that this work programme is very important but that it is taking place in a wider context , which is a profound debate about where our European Union is going , what its future is . #% Cover can be extended for 30 days to encourage citizens to go and exercise their rights in a single market and shop across borders . #% Mr President , I am distinctly uneasy about this proposal , but there does not seem to be an easy answer . #% Mr President , it is very kind of Commissioner Monti to read me out my question . #% However , the most important part of the agreement , clause 6 , which covers elimination , prevention and protection , unfortunately includes some ambiguity regarding risk assessment and precisely which preventative elements need to be implemented by employers and when . #% I wonder if many people will notice the celebration . #% However , there are a number of paragraphs that we fundamentally disagree with , for instance paragraphs 4 , 16 , 28 , 31 , 47 and 132 . #% Parliament should let the legal process run its course and allow the Court to reach a proper decision . #% It is no secret that my group would not have chosen Mr Giscard d' Estaing as its preferred candidate , but as you know , Mr President , we have had experiences of constitutional reports from Mr Giscard d' Estaing in this Parliament . #% I , for one , welcome Turkey 's accession to the European Union in the course of time . #% However there is more than a hint of heavy-handedness in this debate with regard to a country which is small enough not to have to be appeased because it is neither politically nor economically important to the European Union . #% In rural areas , including large parts of my own constituency of the West Midlands , the percentage could be higher still . #% Members of the European Parliament , before you give this Commission power , remember that 60 years ago , an Iron Curtain came down on Europe but now , with this Commission , there is an economic iron fist and it is being felt in Greece today . #% Let us not forget that sugar producers , processors and refiners are not the poorest people on this planet . #% That is very good news . #% I do not take a religious perspective , but it is clear that it is not only Europeans who feel strongly that the situation at Guantanamo Bay offends against our sense of justice . #% Meanwhile , tax increases caused by the implementation of the IMF structural adjustment package have increased poverty and , to save money , much-needed credits previously available to poor farmers have been cut . #% I am sure such a relationship will continue with any future chair as well . #% As the common fisheries policy is widely acknowledged as having been disastrous , so too is the CAP . #% There also needs to be help for farmers wishing to retire from the sector . #% Prime Minister , I am told by my government that in Copenhagen , you were always well briefed , determined , clever and gave real leadership . #% I feel that we have to take this extremely seriously . #% The accession process for other candidate countries , or indeed the addition of new countries to the accession process , should not impact on the timetable for Bulgaria and the assessment of its progress . #% 
In particular , Commissioner , I would like to thank your own staff - Mr Schulte-Braucks and Mr Delneufcourt , who I think has been largely responsible for many of those 400 pages . #% The European Union has to have a common policy in relation to China . #% The United Nations World Food Programme expects to dispense aid to almost four million malnourished people this year -- over one third of the population . #% There is a great deal of goodwill towards the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme , as demonstrated by the speed with which the committee has conducted its business on the Locatelli report . #% Indeed , do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat ? #% I hope that the EU counts itself as such a democracy and that this principle will be fully expressed in the forthcoming vote . #% It did not take it seriously in 1998 when we had the problem and fans across Europe were denied the opportunity to see the World Cup . #% This is a rather bizarre proposal from the point of view of comitology - two different annexes controlled by two different management systems . #% Mr President , I have taken our Vice-President , Mr Dimitrakopoulos ' chair , just to remind ourselves that democracy in the Mediterranean did not begin with this debate . #% Imagine that it happens to your daughter , your son , your father , your mother , your brother , your sister . #% Batteries which are sold now will not come into the waste stream for more than 16 years . #% I recognise that what he has done is lay down the gauntlet to Parliament to get its act together on carrying out assessments of its own amendments . #% We in the UK are currently witnessing something of the order of 7,000 new applicants for asylum every month and over 80 % of these eventually turn out after investigation to be bogus . #% Just as resolutions of this Parliament on the rights of people with autism and on the recognition of sign language for deaf people have meant real achievements , I believe that will be true from today onwards for people with multiple sclerosis . #% It is fair to say that in the past there was a traditional view that the European Parliament and the European Commission should operate in an almost permanent state of collusion to take on the vested interests of Member States and so promote European integration . #% In Britain we say ` you must put your money where your mouth is ' . #% It is crazy to carry on as we do when nearly 50 % of the 130 species of shark are now endangered . #% Mr President , Mr Barroso wants the European Union to engage with civil society ; Mr Winkler wants to motivate EU citizens . #% It is the paramount duty of all politicians in Europe to achieve that as soon as possible . #% It ignores what folk might want to see , given freedom of choice . #% I was working entirely on the assumption that the reason we were calling for these declarations was that the Member States would look into where the waste and fraud had come and , maybe , even corruption . #% It comprehensively rejects those who claim that the WTO is beyond redemption ; that it can not be reformed ; that it is inherently biased against the poor or the dispossessed ; and that it is just an agent for the rule of the jungle , rather than the rule of law . #% When this case first went to the court , 11 of the then 15 Member States opposed it ; the court ignored them . #% We want a British voice . #% With regard to the number of coins and the dimensions of the coins : again I would support the rapporteur . #% The alternative resolutions tabled substantially modified the Report , and did not meet the consistent position we have held for 5 years now . #% I would like to give a few examples of why we support this new strategy . #% The expectation is to reach completion by 2005 in terms of a regulatory framework and 2010 for the knowledge-based economy . #% I would like to end by thanking those who helped me with this report , especially my researcher Nicky Smith , who waded through every single statistic . #% Mr President , the problem here is that Member States fail to enforce the rules in far too many instances . #% What a contrast to the series of Members States ' proposals . #% Mr President , we stand today at the brink of an historic process as we vote to finally reunite in democracy , peace and prosperity our divided continent of Europe , with the accession of ten new members . #% That is what they are paid to be doing here ; we are paid to legislate ! #% The controls are now better and , as a result of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health being set up in February and the evidence it collates , we can now say that we have a rapid-alert system that ought to work . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , I shall start by welcoming yesterday 's appointment of Mariangela Zappia as Head of Delegation in Geneva . #% I would hope that the President-in-Office gives us clear answers to the six questions listed within the oral question and that he does not give us the answers that Ecofin gave us on 8 November 2005 . #% I have heard religion mentioned . #% This third reading stage it is not the end of the journey , but it is a very significant point on that road towards the protection of human health and the enhancement of animal welfare . #% I believe this is the wrong way around . #% I should like to make it clear that I actually did vote in both of those votes and voted against . #% In any case , even the British can not get it right for all of our country . #% Surely they could remain , in the same way that national patent filings have now coexisted with European patents for nearly 30 years . #% Also , could he comment on rumours that European multinationals based in South Africa , which have been protected by their industrial regime , are seeking to restrict the scope of industrial free trade within the context of this agreement ? #% Our British system has worked extremely well for decades , so why should British ports be disrupted when , clearly , this form of legislation is aimed at certain ports on the continent ? #% I am afraid oil demand will not go down unless there is more concrete structural action on both renewables and energy efficiency . #% If that is the case , what about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and what role will Parliament have in renegotiating or reassessing the financial perspective ? #% Mr Cashman said that the European Union is fifteen countries . #% Madam President , I agree with most of what has been said tonight . #% Given the pursuit of those higher returns for potential new and growing firms , it is not perhaps surprising to learn that an entire industry has sprung up in this field . #% Also in the rules as I recall , you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence , for the second week running , I miss out on a question . #% Many of us objected to this , but we did not object to Mr Watson 's right to speak his mind . #% My committee feels that the money , inadequate at the moment , should be used to improve the facilities and services offered , which is why we also want to see an overall strategy for the development of services , with a view to refugees and displaced persons being able to play a fully active role in society as equals . #% A rise in military and political violence has since ensued , including the flight of some 65 000 civilians to safety in Thailand . #% This House also called for the reinforcement of the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses , inter alia , with regard to discrimination , etc. based on sexual orientation . #% I think it is becoming clear that the self-regulation that Mr Frattini talked about is probably no longer enough . #% Not doing this might be a mistake of historic consequences that could lead to very serious disorder in the future . #% I welcome the agreement reached by EU foreign ministers to freeze the assets of Hamas , but regret their delay in coming to this decision . #% Mr Kreissl-Dörfler 's report provides important guidelines should future legislation be required to tackle a new outbreak , were it to occur anywhere across the European Union . #% The future of European democracy rests very heavily on Irish shoulders . #% The general public , the taxpayers of Europe , are looking for the reform which we promised almost three years ago . #% Mr President , the European Constitution is dead . #% The Treaty prescribes the creation of an area of freedom , justice and security , but the Tampere summit is in danger of turning only into a security summit . #% The second point which is very important is that there ought to be a target or targeted fund for the micro companies in particular . #% We believe that competition rules need to give way to general-interest services , and not the reverse . #% The compromise , by contrast , only allows data over 15 years old to be shared , again increasing the likelihood that repeat tests would be undertaken . #% My objective has been to create an agency with greater independence and decision-making powers . #% 
This is notably exemplified by the way in which the 133 Committee continues to take important and highly political decisions in the trade field without any published records or public account . #% These concerns and the added concerns about constitutional implications and loss of sovereignty leave my country , the UK , happy to remain outside for the time being . #% There are not many amendments and I can see no reason at all for delaying any further this report . #% Inward investment , the development of civil society , small businesses and citizens ' rights and freedoms , are also part of the democratic process that is starting to come together . #% The sentence of death by stoning , which is carried out by burying her alive up to her neck and then inviting onlookers to stone her , was delayed until after the birth of her child . #% The only answer I can give is that if a Member State recognises that the children produced by a stable relationship qualify for the variety of benefits , we will fully recognise that . #% We did not anticipate effectively the extraordinary scale of animal movements , particularly of sheep , in February 2000 and later . #% I stress that the second part of my amendment states that ` the buying authorities publish , along with the call for tender , the names of those firms or persons who have advised in the drawing up of the specifications ' . #% His support for Berlin during the Cold War , his inaugural address : ' ask not what your country can do for you ' , but also for the Kennedy Peace Corps . #% However , responsibility for ratification of the Treaty lies with the Member States , in accordance with national law . #% It is unthinkable that we should move to nearly 30 Member States without the IGC re-examining that question . #% Organised crime is low . #% The Council and the Commission have accepted the vast majority of the amendments passed by Parliament at its first reading in March 2002 : on the choice of EU regulator for bonds , on a light touch for small and medium-sized businesses , on tailoring requirements to different issues , on lightening the burden on issues . #% This resolution reflects a widely held sense of outrage . #% I do not just want to know about 96 things that you are starting , I want to know how you are getting on with the existing work we have asked you to do and what priorities you are allocating to that . #% I would like to remind colleagues that when you apply for and are granted a patent it does not have to include all the details . #% Finally , I should like to thank the rapporteur . #% We already see in far too many countries , pensioners with an inadequate basic pension unable to participate fully in society and often unable to meet their basic needs . #% In particular , we support the rapporteur 's criticism of the Commission 's failure to ensure that Bulgaria and Romania achieve adequate standards of financial control . #% Here I want to join my colleagues in urging both the Commission and the Council to take speedy action to implement the measures to further organic husbandry , as recommended by the Committee on Agriculture , for which Mrs Barthet-Mayer has been such an eloquent spokeswoman on this issue . #% That is highly regrettable and I would ask the President to ask her to attend that session so that she can hear the views and opinions of this Parliament . #% We remember in the past all the allegations of graft when there was direct EU budgetary aid to the Palestinian Authority under Arafat . #% As Mr MacCormick says , we have to get people across the Union together talking region to region , university to university . #% Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament . #% However , there is , as I still say , the essential point and what I have added to it is that there should be cooperation and some kind of harmonisation , not only of the protection that is afforded , but the response mechanism in the event of such a tragedy , or an attempt being made . #% Anyone can give advice and still bid for the contract , as long as the advice that has been given does not preclude others from competing fairly . #% The amount of money that can be put into a small suitcase will be roughly ten times larger than it would have been if we had restricted the currency to smaller notes . #% In many cases the victims are seen as the offenders : we must turn that around . #% It is because they know it is not going to be consequential on their profits . #% Updating our tourism statistics database can , in turn , play an important role in giving policy makers a good basis for implementing successful tourism policies . #% Too many athletes and coaches either do not understand this or knowingly take the risk . #% In particular it seems that the EU must now accept the verdict of developing countries that they do not want negotiations on the Singapore issues . #% We all need to rally round and encourage Prime Minister Erdogan to carry on where he seemed to start last August but where he has stalled , no doubt because of the army . #% It is one of the great benefits of Europe which we have recently brought to the public and we should publicise it much better . #% If I thought they were going to do the same thing next year , i.e. submit an SAB at the end of July , I would not hesitate to call a special meeting of the Budgets Committee within the 45-day timetable to make sure that we blocked it so that we could discuss it in full . #% However , the setting at the moment of any kind of European-wide environmental taxes must be better thought out . #% I have to ask why the interinstitutional talks on this issue are still stalled ? #% I hope the Commission will make sure in the Action Programme , proposed to accompany this package , that we have a lot of projects from the applicant states . #% These are standards which I , and my colleagues in the current Commission , sincerely want to meet . #% So why is growth so poor ? #% Today 's vote will help this process and I strongly support it and hope it will mean funds will flow . #% We are asking , as stated in the resolution , for a report from the Commission as to how it is going to achieve this objective of eliminating outstanding commitments . #% Employment must be the core of that agenda . #% Those values are central to our work here in Parliament and to our work with developing countries , and that is democracy , the rule of law and , above all , the eradication of poverty . #% Most credit rating agencies employ children who can barely read a balance sheet . #% During the last ten years we have witnessed a remarkable transformation in that country and through change of political systems and socio-economic reforms it has already achieved the political and economic basis for accession . #% I note with interest his reference to telecommunications and the changes in the shape of the communication industry . #% Thus the key to safety is an effective post-licensing surveillance system , sensitive enough to identify adverse reactions speedily and to enable swift and effective action to be taken . #% The only way to guarantee equal treatment is to end transitional measures . #% Only in this way is the transatlantic security link properly guaranteed . #% I obviously agree with the rapporteur that competition rules must be applied rigorously in order to prevent cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of the aid . #% The greatest service that could be done to Western security and transatlantic relations would be to draw back ESDP under the Nato umbrella and for us all to work together in solidarity for common ends . #% We , as a group , would like to have a five-year financial perspective negotiated from 2005 to apply from 2006 onwards . #% We also need to highlight the link between cancer and obesity - the most avoidable cause of cancer after tobacco . #% However , the total percentage of renewable energy used in the EU has remained at 6 % since 1990 . #% Yet many of my colleagues here believe that the fence represents an annexation of Palestinian territory by Israel , although the final borders will be settled only through a land-for-peace deal . #% We know in this House that on-call working is a very controversial issue and something that we do not particularly welcome . #% We welcome the fact that the UN has appealed for nearly USD 36 million worth of humanitarian aid , anticipating the food shortages that will result later this year from the current political events in Madagascar , but we strongly condemn the coup d'état and all attempts to seize power by undemocratic means . #% What I do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve . #% In the interests of time , I will make just one other point . #% In my own country , the United Kingdom , that cuts across national provisions . #% It may be that there are other sectors for which a similar approach would be helpful . #% Pressure must be brought to finally resolve the Transnistrian question , which truncates and corrupts the Moldovan state . #% The Commission has no plans to initiate medical examination programmes . #% Jacques Santer recently berated Member State governments who had some queries about the single currency timetable . #% My greatest concern is the proposal contained in some of the amendments adopted in committee to extend the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency to take on security . #% 
So it was not something that just happened ` over there ' . #% If we had more cooperation with the Member States we would not have as many problems . #% Why not a simple declaration of human rights under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty without the need for a charter for litigation ? #% The Italian so-called ` final compromise package ' is not acceptable to the Liberal Group -- nor , I suspect , to a majority of this Parliament . #% Finally , let me say this : if we see one individual attacked because of religion , sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , whatever , and we stand back and do nothing then we create the conditions that brought about the Second World War . #% This meant that all the top companies had to exclude themselves from the revising process if they wanted to bid . #% Mr President , I will try not to read any sinister political motivation into that . #% Regarding amendments resubmitted by colleagues , Amendment No 67 , concerning the setting of MRLs , covers vulnerable groups . #% I am not entirely sure that , if we adopt it as it is , it will have the effects that Mr Ford fears . #% It is crucial that all the partners in this great project begin to trust each other and the service , including the most populous and imperious states . #% Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale , the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials , which is already very strong , will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training , the allocation of responsibility , the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing . #% In conclusion , the message is quite simple : Terrorism must not be allowed to win . #% In our view , nothing has slowed down the WTO more than the debacle in Seattle which was caused in no small part by the chaotic and exclusive structures , rules and procedures of the WTO . #% In addition , we consider that all the technical annexes to this directive are important and should be subject to adaptation by a technical committee that operates in a way that respects the modus vivendi and which we would hope to see developed into a true partnership between the Commission , Parliament and the Council in the coming few years . #% However , I say to Mr Libicki that they are also the source of Europe 's greatest dynamism , prosperity and cultural richness . #% I have detected a bit of gloom among a number of colleagues . #% I have certainly learned a great deal from it . #% It is surely much more irresponsible to launch such a politically and commercially sensitive trade dispute without even a ritual nod towards the normal standards of transparency and political probity . #% These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege . #% One of the other things that has particularly suffered is the credibility of government . #% Paragraph 11 should read ` five ' crossing points instead of ` four ' , because that would bring us up to date with the facts as they are today . #% Mr President , this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure , which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the report . #% We need to ensure , however , that when we reform those processes - whether it be issues concerning co-regulation or external agencies - we see democratic control as the key factor , democratic control in a democratic framework . #% What happens in another part of the world affects us . #% Although we have article 5 in the Lomé Convention , what will you do specifically to enact it in response to the countries that I have referred to in the question ? #% These difficulties occur because the whole spirit of the EU is to use centralised direction in a vain attempt to achieve an idealised society by making laws and restricting activity . #% Thirdly , why were the officials of polling stations in the north replaced at midday by military and other civilian personnel ? #% We have to accept , however , that there are times when it is roads that provide the necessary access into the hinterland . #% Increaisng subsidies over three years to rich countries is totally indefensible . #% I want to ask you and those others who preside over these sessions to be much more strict about points of order . #% Mr President , the earthquake that struck Turkey in the early hours of 17 August was the worst in over half a century in a region that is prone to such shocks . #% It is vital to keep to the timetable and the road map . #% We are not interested in using this as a device for protectionism to prevent workers being posted . #% Positive abstention and the greatest scope for qualified majority voting will lead the way to the development of the CFSP , although , of course , the section on qualified majority voting is really no more than a slightly more ambitious version of what we already have in the Maastricht Treaty and , ultimately , will depend on political will to see it carried out . #% Similarly the beautiful cream coloured carpets used in some of the committee rooms I predict will be irreversibly stained and soiled within 3 months and rendered unusable , making it a very poor and impractical choice of colour and ultimately a waste of resources . #% What would be the attitude of the EU if it were a company , not a country , that chose to ignore legislation which other similar businesses were complying with ? #% She said at one point , rather blandly I thought , that she was going to propose tangible measures in various sectors . #% That would be a better approach , both right in principle and right in practice . #% However , we can not afford to behave in an erratic , inconsequential and fragmented manner . #% Fulfilling both of these objectives requires a delicate balance to be struck . #% She has issued a recommendation on drink driving . #% Commissioner Rehn has correctly observed that for Turkey the journey is as important as the destination . #% I think the election process was respected by the people . #% That is why I so welcome Mr Beaupuy 's report and indeed his leadership of the Urban and Housing Intergroup in this Parliament . #% We believe that the Commission 's proposals are along the right lines . #% However , it did so on that day some two-and-a-half years ago when Parliament rejected the takeover directive . #% There is not a major legal difficulty here , it is a technical problem . #% It is not our intention to introduce amendments tonight which prevent this directive coming into force , or in any sense allow for the postponement of serious discussion until the next millennium . #% In the meantime , we have to keep monitoring this serious issue , about which many citizens are concerned . #% The consumer decides on price . #% We need to make use of modern and easy means of communication , but please do not make that an excuse for having dismal paper means for publicising and contacting the ombudsman . #% Indeed , there are now doubts over the viability of the project . #% I hope that in Oslo , on 10 December , should the ceremony take place , we have the most muscular presence on behalf of the European Union , standing by its foreign policy priorities of human rights and democracy . #% We sympathise with his position and ask why it is that the US pharmaceuticals industry seems to have been able to marshal US government support in backing its irrational reaction to the EU proposal . #% The British Government has made it clear that Burma would not be deemed a full participating Member of next year 's ASEM meeting in London under the British Presidency . #% Will there be comparable programmes in the future ? #% I ask the EU to be proactive and to offer its services as a mediator , as no other body seems to be doing so . #% The facts are clear . #% Constant references to events which took place generations ago in different circumstances should be avoided . #% Once this directive eventually comes into force , it will represent one more step towards the completion of a fully functioning single market . #% The history of this project means , however , that the Commission considers that certainty about the realistic hand-over date can only be established when a specific date has been fixed in a contract that will also make provision for financial penalties for late delivery . #% The hearings are not even mentioned in the Treaties . #% So far as employment rights are concerned , rights of assessment and promotion , rights of appointment to management , there is no barrier and no hierarchy has expressed any direct or indirect desire to install such a barrier . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs , Mr Groote , Mr Krahmer and particularly Mrs Harms , for their excellent cooperation on this report . #% It has now been on the statute book for over a year and my understanding is that there are still companies who are just refusing to comply with that directive . #% My group would like to focus on that point . #% 
Madam President , I must refute what Mr Brok said . #% If there is alleged past failure , then the place to seek redress is in the national courts . #% I would also like confirmation from Commissioner Solbes that , in his opinion , for the UK to join the euro it will have to spend at least two years locked into the ERM II phase first before proceeding . #% This House has often asserted that the rule of law rests on the presumption of innocence in the absence of the proof of guilt . #% For example , if a Minister goes down on his knees , cut his wrists and writes a pledge in letters of blood that he will deliver the habitats directive in full within an agreed timetable , is she prepared to assist the region and provide structural funding in such circumstances ? #% Whilst we seek greater coordination of tax authorities in trying to assist SMEs involved in cross-border trade , we acknowledge that this issue remains the competence of the EU Member States . #% If it is lost then the rapporteur can do what he wishes after that . #% This culture of closed decision-making is a major setback in the fight to peel back the layers of secrecy , one which parallels our own struggle with the European Council . #% I believe that we have managed to do so . #% It is a terrible shame that several Member State governments - my own included - have set their hearts and minds against the proposed directive on temporary employment agency workers . #% I support both contributors in that regard . #% The divisions of the past into the technical areas of voice telephony , broadcasting and new services have led to a complex legislative and regulatory framework which has arisen due to a variety of different technologies being applied . #% If the Council was to refrain from commenting on matters where it had no competence , there would be very few matters in the world that it would be able to comment on . #% If the Treaty had been brought into being before such a proposal had come forward we would not have accepted it . #% I understand the Commissioner 's difficulty in explaining why this has happened . #% However , Terry Pearce from Precision Components remains sceptical about Europe 's involvement . #% Reading your paper , it struck me that in a sense the first stage of recovery in the building of Europe is for the Commission itself to recover its self-confidence and poise . #% Young people at work or training in another European country will need a level of protection . #% I assume that they will be working together with agencies such as UNHCR and others that have such expertise . #% Later , I chaired the observer delegation to the Palestine elections . #% Madam President , batteries form part of our everyday lives . #% The Commissioners are politicians who hold office thanks to the confidence they receive from the European Parliament , and only for as long as they continue to enjoy that confidence , because we can of course dismiss them in a vote of censure . #% The Commission has ruthlessly exploited the decision of the court in order to publish a list of nine new areas of competence , which gives it the right to create new laws and impose criminal penalties . #% At present , it seems that animals have more rights than children in Europe . #% There is a real doubt , however , that these statements of principle will actually become reality . #% It goes far further than we could support . #% You talked this morning about leading in Europe , and there is much talk of five-year plans , of the great visions that you have ; but it seems to me that you have one or two problems . #% Now we have to have a foolproof method of measuring all the ingredients . #% In East Timor an estimated one-third of the population has died since the Indonesian invasion of 1975 . #% We support the Spanish Government and security forces in their tough stance against ETA terrorism and express solidarity with the Spanish people and in particular , those that have suffered directly as victims of terrorism . #% I understand the regional pride of many members from Belgium and I do not question that much time is being spent by the organisers of Euro 2000 looking into the safety and security aspects of the competition . #% Is it not ludicrous to keep calling for mobility of labour to boost economic growth while preventing those 20 million from going to work in another Member State ? #% What measures can be taken to protect us , given this danger ? #% We want to see support for organisations of disabled people . #% The Helsinki Council made Turkey an official candidate country . #% In the case of the United Kingdom , is it worth us losing the presumption of innocence before guilt ? #% We will rigorously assess the case of each individual country to make sure that the tough questions are answered and that we do not shirk our responsibilities . #% We will help our planet and our future by utilising a variety of measures and not by making one scheme fit all . #% Religious minorities were targeted by the government , but I am pleased to hear now that has been vetoed by the president . #% The Commission must put its money where its mouth is and actually fund some sensible programmes for disabled people . #% The final point is that penalties must be approximated throughout Europe . #% Two amendments have been tabled to make it clear that we are talking about the EUR 1 billion from both the EU and the Member States . #% Of course we want prime ministers to provide protection from threats like organised crime , drug running , terrorism and sex crimes , but let them also focus on the threat of discrimination and racism . #% In some ways , for very good reasons , the Council showed a good degree of diligence in its considerations of this proposal . #% We support Commissioners Fischler 's proposals to reform the CAP and believe it is long overdue . #% In our view , a blanket spread in the use of the opt-out is not the answer to SIMAP and Jaeger . #% I am frankly amazed that , amongst all this talk of legality , I have not heard one word about Iraqi treatment of prisoners of war , which is contrary to the Geneva Convention . #% The rapporteur also referred , quite rightly , to the Kosovo crisis , in which Member States failed to take on their responsibilities and poorer states , such as Albania , were left to deal with large numbers of refugees . #% We are very mindful of that . #% Aside from the Internal Market Services Directive , we do not want a lot more legislation during your Commission in the internal market area . #% I want to see the EU move on to a new agenda : a reforming agenda that tackles effectively the sense of alienation between the institutions of Brussels ; a reforming agenda that works for fundamental economic reform through liberalisation and more open markets , and puts growth at the forefront of its priorities . #% Mr President-in-Office , we have that opportunity all the time . #% I should also like to mention the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport . #% Afghanistan is now at an historical crossroad . #% This war is a major disaster and all possible power must be mobilised to restore peace at long last . #% Mr President , I would agree with much of what we have heard already in the debate this evening . #% If they do not have them , things do not work . #% Finally , I should like to ask that we also get an acknowledgement from the Council that Question Time is not just a time for MEPs to ask questions : it is also a time for the Presidency-in-Office to provide answers . #% Concerning an appeal , I understand his caution , but he said that we can make an appeal . #% How can you have a financial perspective unless you know what the policy priorities are going to be ? #% We are facing a catastrophe that affects both the survival of our closest relatives and the people who rely on forests for their livelihoods . #% 50 % are deliberate and SMEs wait 50 % longer than big businesses to receive their pay . #% I would not be happy with that and I am sure other people in other areas of interest in Category IV would adopt a similar attitude . #% Did they not know that only a bloodbath could only ever ensue as a result ? #% Amazing . #% Thank you for your offer to send me more information . #%
