She has been a great asset to the Community and a great source of support on issues that have very often been discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs . #% In the event of the disappearance from the market of a manufacturer , such a guarantee would ensure that the costs do not have to be borne by society or by other manufacturers . #% I hope we will be in a position to help Robert 's family if the necessity arises , if none of the witnesses , nor indeed the IRA or Sinn Féin themselves , are brave and honourable enough to supply to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or the Ombudsman the information necessary to institute criminal proceedings . #% Mr President , once again we are seeing the same situation . #% Both sides must respect international humanitarian law and protect and assist the civilian population in the combat zone , as well as in the safe zone . #% The first concerns the whereabouts of Aung San Suu Kyi . #% I heard talk here today of how wrong it was of President Barroso to mention that the Commission was going to drop ` x ' number of directives , or that it was going to reduce the number of directives in force . #% At the same time , I would expect the donors to insist that the Bhutanese Government facilitate a rapid repatriation of the refugees . #% It is only when we receive full explanations that we can give this support . #% I do not agree with a harmonised tax system or with - as Mr Berthu said - many of the harmonisations that are going on within the EU . #% Please ensure that aid from the EU , and indeed American aid , is used as it should be used , not to increase the attacks by the militia against the peace communities in the name of trying to take out the guerrillas . #% The Council wishes to maintain and deepen relations with Albania . #% A lot of new computers have just one password to turn on the computer and do not have a separate password to control access to the Internet . #% I appeal to the Commissioner to give us a more favourable response this evening , because the vote tomorrow will go in favour of the study , and it is time for the Commission to face up to that . #% This should ideally be part of a global solution , with industry and governments sitting down with the International Civil Aviation Organization , as Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Kyoto Protocol suggests . #% I have carefully read the Court of Auditors ' report on the accounts for that year , particularly in relation to agriculture and the Structural Funds . #% It is perceived as one of the big Member States using bully-boy tactics to impose its will to the detriment of a small nation such as Ireland or Portugal . #% I fully agree with this objective which will help prevent some of the overcrowding and environmental problems associated with big cities . #% It is a completely separate fuel sector which has also fertiliser as a component . #% Of course , that is important but it is also very important to have the will of the majority . #% We have succeeded in obtaining many improvements . #% However , merely throwing it to Parliament when there is no time available to put a reasoned and responsible viewpoint forward is a bigger insult to Parliament than not consulting it at all . #% I share Mr Howitt 's concern that the existing laws do not crack down on the proceeds of crime . #% I welcome the return of this report from conciliation and I hope it will not be too long before all our Member States transpose it and it becomes law . #% Madam President , for too long the European Union has had its hands tied when it comes to fighting organised crime . #% This process should give priority to the meeting of human needs and the fulfilment of basic human rights . #% However , all of us , and the EU institutions in particular , need to recognise that the plutonium being sent across the seas to Japan from both Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France is directly usable in nuclear explosive devices . #% I am very proud of what you have achieved and you should rightly be proud of a job very well done . #% Support for coalfield communities , learning projects are an essential component of achieving economic and social cohesion . #% Most importantly , it must be remembered that the dignity of the Members of this House and their rights as elected representatives of the people of Europe must be foremost in any formulation of our rules . #% There have been controversies during your Presidency and I agree with Enrique Barón Crespo that you indeed had the courage of your convictions . #% I would like to express my full confidence in Commissioner Pinheiro and his team of negotiators who I know will make every effort to conclude an agreement in line with the negotiating mandate they have been given by the Council of Ministers ; a mandate which did not reflect the public statements or commitments given by heads of state or government to President Mandela which , of course , raised very highly the level of expectations in South Africa . #% As a result of this new initiative , all European Union Member States will establish formal incident-reporting systems to facilitate the collection of information on actual or potential safety deficiencies involving aeroplanes in Europe . #% But I have a problem when we impose from on high purist-type ideas on those who can not defend themselves . #% I certainly recognise that the greatest environmental disasters occur as a consequence either of irresponsibility or the actions of those who are driven by the profit motive , irrespective of the consequences . #% I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX . #% I reject this notion and support the concept of voluntary modulation which was agreed by the 15 Member States in Berlin . #% Integrated coastal zone management initiatives usually focus on a central coordinating mechanism which requires comparatively low levels of core funding . #% The challenges that lie ahead are great , not just for the quality of life for those who reside in an increasingly urbanised Europe . #% This is blatant , modern-day colonialism and we should not allow it . #% The list is not exhaustive . #% Equally , it is important that there is an intensification of support for employment initiatives in urban and rural blackspots . #% Fisheries , unlike any other industry , depend so much on seasonality and weather factors . #% This means that anyone supporting this principle must abide by its decisions , including the use of veto . #% We must find some fast-track codecision procedure which can be used in these circumstances and fully respects the role of the Members of this House . #% We still see - and unfortunately this is at the heart of most of these cases - parents using their unfortunate children as weapons in the war between the sexes . #% To ask farmers to increase their scale to make up that difference is just neither practical nor possible . #% In Ireland , such statements quite simply polarise the debate about whether we defend the nation or build Europe . #% There are occasions when `` a one size fits all '' economic model does not fit . #% As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice , we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades . #% Article 301 of the penal code remains in place to punish those responsible for ` a public denigration of Turkishness or State authorities ' . #% How much innovation do you think will occur if that lone programmer needs to contract a team of patent lawyers ? #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I welcome the action of the Committee on Legal Affairs in putting this timely question to the Commission . #% The Commission is meant to be putting together a policy on invasive alien species , but so far we have seen no sign of it . #% I refer to Annex VI on the restrictions on the movement of equidae in this area . #% . I wish to draw the attention of the presidency to the Euratom Treaty . #% Could it not have been made to coincide with the ending of the HELIOS programme ? #% Mr President , although it is hard to imagine from the relative comfort and security of a western European country like Ireland , globally persecution is more widespread than ever . #% I know that we have sent out a tender for an international management team , but we are fiddling while Rome burns . #% New buildings continue to be erected on the settlements in and around Jerusalem and the prospects for the roadmap appear dim unless action is taken in the immediate future . #% Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January . #% Indeed , the trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical contracts has a strong gender and generational dimension . #% At the moment , it is a hugely politically-charged issue . #% Would she also accept that in my country , Ireland , the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union , because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union . #% This is one of the most important issues to be dealt with by Parliament in the last few years . #% Let us be very careful about border controls in relation to importing again this horrible disease particularly to countries that are now rabies-free . #% 
At the moment it is unused and is guarded by Turkish troops . #% When the Commission 's proposals first appeared , we , in the Green Party , welcomed them . #% We can now afford to do this and these excellent professionals are a boost to our health service . #% Tomorrow we must give this report a ringing endorsement , but we must also ensure that we do not tie our hands . #% Their only alternative is to remain working with Irish Ferries and earn approximately 50 % of their current salary . #% Mr President , this is perhaps one of the most important debates we have had in this House . #% Anyone who does not understand that will pay the price through higher interest rates and an inflation-prone Euro-zone . #% Industry has given the Member States , the Commission and Parliament a very clear message : it wants consistent judgments under Community jurisdiction and a common jurisprudence , in particular regarding enforcement . #% This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated . #% The Israeli Government has failed to meet its obligations to dismantle settlement outposts and freeze settlement activity . #% To take an example , in 1992 we as a Union drew up the Petersberg Tasks which offered comprehensive non-military and military security options . #% It is not the first time a Commission President has attended a G8 meeting , or that a Prime Minister and President-in-Office has attended a G8 or G7 meeting . #% The creation of a single European market has largely removed the restrictions on the free movement of capital , goods and services throughout the Union . #% Is it intended to make it mandatory on national governments to implement such a regional policy , thus providing jobs in the regions to sustain rural communities and provide off-farm employment for farmers who do not have viable farms and other rural dwellers ? #% -- Mr President , I am pleased to have this brief opportunity to strongly support this resolution . #% When governments set targets for reducing CO2 emissions , they have a responsibility to introduce mechanisms and structures that will facilitate this . #% It is carried by small flies , by what we call midges , and has to be brought under control this summer . #% I would also like to say that personally I am very glad that the resolution includes a proscription of the death penalty . #% We now need to work in earnest to begin the programme of reform for 1999 . #% They have seriously weakened what was already a very weak proposal , primarily by removing any vestige of a reduction in fishing effort : the very thing that is most needed . #% I am greatly concerned that these basic protections are not sufficiently enshrined in this current proposal . #% We should make progress on trade conditional on progress in securing and improving human rights . #% Here is the position of the Official Genetic Interest Group in the UK : ' If a patent is granted on a product or therapy or pharmaceutical product which incorporates or relies upon knowledge of a gene sequence , the patent protection should not cover the sequence itself . #% By doing so the legitimacy of the European integration project has been enhanced and the potential for creating a more democratic and inclusive Europe has also been created . #% I would like a precise answer here today . #% Minister Roche deserves a boost after all his work and , most importantly of all , the civil servants deserve not only a good pat on the back , but also perhaps a few extra euros as a result of the new agreements ! #% That is a total distortion of the truth and an abuse of the urgency procedure in this Parliament . #% Despite this , the RDA for Vitamin E remains a measly 10 IU . #% The supply must be safe but , by definition , a voluntary patient who might have HIV is no safer than a person with no health problems and who is paid . #% Enlargement of the Union to include countries from Central and Eastern Europe is absolutely unthinkable unless we have this kind of control over organized crime . #% I wonder if the fact that you did not have enough resources at your disposal has anything to do with the report that was published yesterday by the Court of Auditors , which says that a lot of work is being impeded by people being on short-term contracts . #% We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament , by members of national parliaments and students of European politics . #% The report 's proposal for the development of a strategy at EU level to address the impact of adverse weather conditions on EU agriculture is very welcome and indeed very pertinent , considering the exceptionally harsh climatic conditions experienced by farmers over the past months . #% We also believe that the EU must ensure coherence between its internal and external policies . #% I should like to say to Mr Prodi how welcome he is here today . #% Mr President , I would like to wish the President-in-Office and his government colleagues every success during the Irish presidency . #% We must tackle this by improved forecasting of payment requirements , but I firmly reject any notion that global amounts could in any way be reduced . #% Mr President , this issue demonstrates beautifully the need for something like the European Union . #% This report and investigation brought home the wider effects . #% It is one thing to play at superstatehood in this rarefied House ; it is quite another to face the real issues of our electorate . #% It is clear that there are a number of gaps remaining and that the insuree and the claimant still face certain difficulties which need to be addressed . #% Only then will the objective of obtaining genuine economic impact be secured for those regions . #% I think that should be referred to the Bureau . #% It is quite clear that this form of punishment is not a deterrent to crime . #% My own country never applied for reduced rates . #% A greater level of dialogue will have to take place to hammer out these issues . #% Neither the Commission nor the Council has covered itself in glory in the past on this issue but we have a more consistent approach now . #% Agreement on the rules under which the new agreement will be concluded is due by the end of March this year , and agreement on the new round itself by the beginning of 2005 . #% Two years ago almost to the day , I stated in this House that decisions and objectives of fish recovery plans can not disregard the social and economic consequences they will have . #% While the American government has halted the movement of potentially dangerous nuclear materials , BNFL is insisting that it will run its nuclear trains from reactors to its controversial Sellafield reprocessing plant . #% The courage and perseverance of the political leaders in the North of Ireland , together with the contribution of the Irish Taoiseach , his predecessors , the British Prime Minister and his predecessors , is only to be commended . #% The credibility of our single currency and its public image and acceptance depend on all Member States adhering fully to it and the rules being applied evenly under the Stability Pact . #% These proposals reflect the reporting requirements of the Marrakesh Accords to the Kyoto Protocol , including the use of flexible mechanisms and registries . #% The Greens are voting against this agreement , as we do with all third-country agreements . #% I share the concerns of colleagues . #% There is no use talking about helping Poland into a position of power when that could be disastrous for the agriculture interests of other parts of the Union . #% I do not want to be told that I can not take fibre , garlic , cranberry juice or folic acid , if I happen to be pregnant . #% We are going to end up with a serious problem in relation to the marine environment . #% To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so , at the end of the day , results in our really helping ourselves . #% We failed , and failed miserably . #% Bearing that in mind , I would ask you , Mr Blair , to concentrate on the urban problems as opposed to dismantling the CAP , which hopefully will strengthen rural communities in the years ahead . #% For myself , I want a complete list of ingredients and a mention of any nutrient-damaging process like irradiation , bleaching , saturation etc. to which the ingredients were exposed . #% Given the circumstances at the time -- the Iron Curtain , the cold war and the military polarisation between East and West -- few other than de Gaulle could have believed that would happen . #% In the rush to secure a WTO deal , I trust that this basic obligation is not being either jeopardised or compromised . #% Can I say , Commissioner , that certainly the very rosy view that has been written for you by the textile unit in DGIII is not my personal experience of the textile sectors within my region and I am sure Mr Caudron will also have a different view from the French region that he represents . #% In relation to ongoing legal action , I can not understand who the Commission is trying to protect . #% 
A few days ago our shipyard was to close because it failed to win the contract to build two ships . #% Those are practical measures which can assist employment growth and retention . #% Agricultural statistics for the period 1993-2003 #% This gear helps with the live release of marlin and so can contribute to the conservation of the stocks . #% I would ask you to write to the Angolan Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels for an explanation of why we were prevented from visiting Angola at the very last moment . #% By tackling climate change in a serious manner , we not only help to preserve our planet for our grandchildren and future generations , but we would also save them and ourselves monetary cost , given that the climate change costs incurred as we aim to protect disappearing species and habitats are very high . #% The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement , while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement . #% No directive has caused me more concern and more anguish in reaching my decision . #% I do , however , regret that the Council and the Commission were quite slow in making progress here . #% As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , it is good news because towns such as Naas , Newbridge , Kilcullen , Wicklow , Athy , Arklow , Kildare and Monasterevin must all in the near future secure the necessary finance for the upgrading of their respective railway operations . #% This information was officially reaffirmed in a démarche to the Danish Presidency six weeks after we arrived in Pakistan . #% However , we must not take for granted the great outpouring of support from the public , who were way ahead of the politicians . #% I would also like to object in very strong terms to the personal attacks on me by the Conservative Party last night . #% I , like my colleagues , do not think that the European Union should be involved in setting out treatment programmes or setting out the delivery of medical services to individual citizens - that is obviously best dealt with at national or local level . #% The effect of the environment legal base is substantively the same as the single market ( Article 95 ) base , which also allows Member States to take stricter measures . #% The CFP needs to combine all aspects of the fishing industry in order to provide a viable future for our fishing communities . #% The other point I wish to make relates to the clause which appears to facilitate the Atlantic Dawn . #% These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps . #% This is basically cosmetics - things to boost people 's egos , making a huge amount of money for the industry . #% We have to deal with the legislation , the powers and the Treaties before us today , and not with what may be given to us in the future under any future Treaty . #% For this reason and for the reasons I have already referred to , I propose to abstain on the final vote on this report while at the same time , firmly recording my support for the Amsterdam Treaty . #% Yes , I agree with an awful lot has been done and we need what is proposed before us here today , but I would rather we use the OIE or WTO standard , so that all countries could agree on the classification , so that what we do in Europe would not be considered a trade barrier by the rest of the world with whom we must trade our meat products and live animals . #% Today , 25 November , 7 650 ILO conventions have been ratified globally , with 47 in the last 12 months . #% I would say to the honourable Member , who I know to be an honourable man , that the problem of Northern Ireland is a problem of double minority . #% An average of ten persons are killed per day in Colombia because of socio-political violence . #% We have obviously achieved this . #% I would ask the rapporteur , if possible , to take on board an idea which I put forward in this House two years ago and am still trying to get support for , which is a charter of carers ' rights . #% President-in-Office , I should like to point out , in relation to health , that one of the big issues with alcohol consumption is its link to youth suicide . #% It is a regrettable decision and it is also unjustifiable . #% Partnership at work must be based on the firm foundation of union recognition . #% A ` Swiss cheese ' Palestinian State on the West Bank , with the Israelis controlling the cheese and the Palestinians controlling the holes , will not work and will not deliver peace to Israel in the long term . #% I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment . #% The truth is that in the Fléchard case , Fléchard was suspected of fraud , the Irish government fined and punished them to the extent of EUR 17 million . #% They have found a previously unknown pathway by which radiation can subvert living cells . #% I also had the honour of being the rapporteur for the report on disability . #% That can best be done through a new federalism based on a European constitution . #% Within the European Union an environmental impact assessment must be carried out on the construction of new roads , water and sewage facilities and large infrastructure projects . #% Likewise , who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first implemented that the number of long-term unemployed would still continue to be the same five years later ? #% That reason is to depoliticise decision-making when it comes to the agricultural budget . #% The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict . #% Surely an Europe which strives to be a Continental power , proud of its economic progress and intellectual capital should not be afraid to acknowledge its spiritual dimension , a dimension which will lend us strength as we work towards peace and security . #% Recent discussions between representatives of the Palestinian authority and Prime Minister Sharon must be seen as a somewhat positive move , but negotiations must surely be meaningful and can not be seen as a cosmetic exercise under any circumstances . #% When the 8300 investors in Ireland , who were putting money aside for their pensions , and about 4000 such investors in Germany went to their respective regulators , they were told to go and talk to the UK regulator . #% Unfortunately there is another element , the witness protection scheme . #% I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states in which the family and marriage is protected . #% Therefore , whilst it is important that each of us must stand up for the inalienable freedoms and rights enjoyed by each individual citizen , as well as by groups of citizens , I think there is a better way to deal with this problem than through a Charter , namely through the incorporation of the Convention into European Union law and its enforcement at national Member State level . #% What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future . #% That was meant to happen in the Fourth Framework Programme and it did not . #% While most of these initiatives were worthwhile in themselves , they were too numerous to implement in a single year . #% We often hide behind structural deficiencies and I would certainly acknowledge that there are structural deficiencies , not least the requirement for unanimity . #% This European Union has a key role to play on the European stage in leading that battle and not falling into line behind those who only see security as an answer to this appalling problem . #% Equally we need to take a strong stand on food imports from outside the EU . #% Is the Minister aware that the Indonesian Foreign Minister has recently taken up this case in a big way and is planning to make a presentation during the UN General Summit which takes place later on this year ? #% It does not make sense . #% We must see and analyse the effects of this directive . #% It is not an unimportant element of this debate . #% This process will be furthered , not diminished , by the enlargement of the Union . #% Given that , as it now stands , companies can opt in or opt out , we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27 ; that is hardly simplification . #% If the Convention drafts such a constitution without the Charter it will , in my view , be a disgrace . #% Based upon my experiences there , I would like to make a few points in the context of the Fava report and the Commission communication , both of which I warmly welcome . #% If these prove to be true , then Israel itself and its army are as guilty of acts of terrorism as those who plan , support and carry out suicide bombings . #% Overall , the protocol offers allocated fishing rights for various species , or category of vessel , to Spain , Italy , Portugal and France . #% So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case . #% I am sorry , Mr President , I can not carry on with this disruption . #% But one should remember that , between 1982 and 1992 , the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked ; they are getting less now , and there was a generous amount of money . #% I should like to raise questions on the social criteria . #% 
I would continue to urge the Italian Presidency of the Council to use every diplomatic means available to get the Middle East peace process back on track . #% At the same time as declaring he was in favour of transparency and openness in relation to this issue , he admitted that he only began to take action on it when it became a public issue about a week ago , despite his role as Secretary-General of NATO during the Balkans War . #% The establishment of a single currency in less than two years ' time is now firmly on course ; the stability and growth pact ensures that the financial markets , investors and the general public can all be confident that the Euro will be a stable currency and will not be subject to fluctuations because of short-term policies being pursued by one or more governments within the new currency zone . #% All of us believe that we must set clear limits to patentability . #% Could you explain what the situation is ? #% The real winners would be the beef barons of South America , if we were to allow Irish farmers to be sold out . #% I am afraid there has been no progress on practical transposition in our Member States . #% For every measure we take here , we are supposed to have an employment audit . #% This fifth Irish presidency takes place at a time when the Union is facing exceptional challenges , including the preparations for economic and monetary union and for enlargement and the revision of the treaties . #% Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper , so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts . #% Mr President , I voted against this report on the Nice Treaty , but I found it ironic that my colleagues from the main political establishment parties in Ireland , who criticised the no-campaign in Ireland saying we have no grounds for criticism , endorsed a report today which is extremely critical of the Nice Treaty . #% We need rigorous enforcement of all legislation so any complaints can be dealt with quickly . #% Who decides when articles of the Treaty are in conflict or when the Commission acts in such a way as to bring those articles into conflict with one another ? #% I also praise the rapporteur for his excellent work and his highly technical dossier . #% I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level . #% I am really sorry that he has not been handed that card . #% I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process . #% That means an increase in the justice and home affairs budget . #% It is not the same situation , but this example helps to illustrate how complex and sensitive these situations are and how the principle of subsidiarity should apply at all times . #% Given its importance for improving quality of life and well-being , there is a role for both public and private initiative in innovation . #% The hours that this dedicated group of individuals currently has to work in Ireland are unacceptably long . #% Yet , in any country in Europe there are employers and businesses crying out for staff and they claim they can not get them . #% Although I feel that we have been successful in raising the awareness and communicating the severity of the situation over the years , we must maintain pressure to ensure that research into the cause of these mortality rates continues and remains well funded . #% In 1970 , 63 % of the world 's population lived in a rural environment , in 2020 it will be 45 per cent . #% By saving energy , we produce fewer CO2 emissions and other pollutants . #% PEACE focuses specifically on reconciliation and the projects it has funded have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations . #% The basic underlying food-safety legislation is that safety should be established on the basis of scientific risk assessment and that consumers should be able to purchase products of their choice provided that they are safe . #% author . - Thank you very much for your reply . #% Mr President , I wish to speak in a personal capacity on a point of order because I have been traduced here tonight by the rapporteur , Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca . #% It is the most visible contribution so far by the European Union to building a stable society in Northern Ireland and , to that extent , it has enormous symbolic value as well . #% Requirements for the placing of veterinary medicinal products on the market have been harmonised since the early 1980s when Council Directive 81/851 was adopted . #% There will be a 30 % increase in the number of vessels , which averaged 42 under the previous protocol , to 55 . #% Mr President , Strasbourg is a beautiful and historic city but , for those of us living some distance away , it is extremely difficult to access . #% However , rehabilitation programmes for children , young people and women must be an intrinsic part of this new initiative . #% There are people in Europe killing each other because of differences over religion , ethnicity and nationality , there are people going to bed hungry , there are people sleeping outdoors and there are people without adequate health care . #% We should not criminalize these people but look at ways of dealing with the root causes of the problem . #% As to the argument whether you slaughter the whole of the herd , there is no scientific evidence to say you should . #% We want a consolidated European space policy . #% I believe that this view is now widely accepted and I hope that the Commission now accepts it also . #% Mr President , I take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the families of five young teenage girls who tragically lost their lives two days ago in Ireland in an accident involving a school bus in which they were travelling . #% The new proposal brings us a further step forward by hopefully ensuring that each Member State will take the necessary measures to guarantee that facilitating or in any way profiting from child prostitution or child pornography is penalised , including by terms of imprisonment of not less than four years . #% Mr President , I wanted to make a point of order because I wish to congratulate you on your patience on taking us through this vote . #% I certainly would commend to you that you examine the question of bringing forward as part of your project a constitution for Europe in the new millennium . #% However , it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation . #% We are speaking today about the 70th anniversary of Franco 's coup . #% The Hague Convention is meant to do one thing , and one thing only . #% The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats - hydrocarbons , radioactive substances and other harmful substances - will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public . #% However , the Barcelona Council targets for childcare are yet to be attained , affecting lower income families the most . #% The Luas tribunal must begin as a matter of urgency . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying , on behalf of my group , that we are very strongly in favour of continuing a form of common fisheries policy within the European Union , because we understand that the management of resources is the best way forward for securing guarantees for the continuation of social and economic development in a lot of coastal regions of the European Union , which would have no other benefit and could not get employment or other developments except from their own natural resources , for example fishing and aquaculture . #% However , the brutal violence of the last fortnight , and indeed over the last 33 months of the intifada , has deepened animosities and intensified emotional hatreds . #% It is very clear that we need to convert old social spending methods into new economic and social opportunity . #% I certainly believe we can improve the situation , I believe this can be achieved , and I believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable . #% It is not true to say , as Mr Chichester implies , that this has been completely solved , that everyone knows exactly how to do it and how much it costs . #% It is illogical to use different strands of the cohesion policy to tackle their socio-economic problems . #% Over the years , Irish farmers have taken great pride in high quality food produced naturally . #% It is a legal obligation . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Mr President , there has not been any assessment of the social , environmental and economic effects of an economic agreement between the European Union and Canada . #% I think it was 16 May last year , the time of the first reading . #% I believe the vast majority holds this view because of the influence of scare stories and theories which are completely without scientific foundation . #% No , there is only disgrace in resisting reform where it is needed . #% Fishermen have promoted the following as alternatives in Northern Ireland : further targeted decommissioning ; real-time closures ; additional technical conservation measures . #% The President-in-Office of the Council , Prime Minister Bertie Ahern , will present to this meeting an assessment as to the state of the negotiations with regard to the new EU treaty . #% I agree with the Commissioner on the need to rebalance the market . #% There is a major contradiction in what the Commission is doing and I wish the Commission would revert to its previous approach of being extremely progressive on the conservation of fisheries . #% We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation . #% 
The European Union needs to be extremely diligent to ensure the same fate does not befall the people who go out and vote . #% I am answering questions here as President-in-Office of the European Union Council of Ministers . #% We are trying to prevent people from coming in and we need to implement measures which will prevent asylum-seekers resorting to traffickers in their effort to reach a country where they can seek asylum , as they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention . #% But those working in general and the capacity of those out of work to get a sustainable job are in part tied up with this question because telecoms , energy , transport , and post are all essential cost structures within the private sector , for which the traded public service sector is critically important in efficiency terms . #% Many governments and many human rights organizations have called for his release and for the release of all political prisoners . #% There is a need for greater communication and understanding not only of what Europe does but also of the responsibility of its citizens to ensure we are as good as we can be . #% This directive must , I believe , ensure that professionals do not face the same uncertainty and obstacles I encountered in exercising the right , as an EU citizen , to exercise one 's profession in the single market . #% I also wish to thank the Commissioner for the fullness and openness of his reporting to Parliament . #% Last November , the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter . #% Herring is being sold at 20 % lower prices than last year . #% Our consumers expect European agriculture to deliver on these multifunctional aspects , and our farmers are prepared to do this . #% In the Doha Development Round , the plan should be about justice and ending poverty , but it seems to be more about dismantling things to make way for the big players , about getting rid of small producers , who are inefficient , democratic and difficult to control and have inconvenient notions as regards lifestyles , and about assigning each area and each country a specialty in which to work efficiently without bothering anyone . #% All of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have to accept responsibility for the present situation . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs van den Burg for an enormously well done job and the Commissioner for introducing this directive . #% On the one side there is the prospect of slipping into violence - a renewed violence , but without hope ; or alternatively , a renewed commitment to redoubling efforts to engage once and for all , and perhaps for the first time , in a genuine and meaningful political dialogue . #% It would appear to put business interests first , which is a very dangerous precedent because environmental and health and food safety requirements should come before any business interests . #% Madam President , I want to thank Mr Gallagher for his report and to say that I agree completely with him when he makes the point that we have to accept the scientific information that is provided to us , and that it is on the basis of scientific information rather than political expediency that we must make decisions relating to conservation . #% On a separate but not unrelated matter , a conciliation process is going to begin shortly in relation to the issue of the new EU regulation concerning the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation security . #% I am also pleased to say that the summit in Dublin was one of the more successful summit meetings in recent years . #% Yes , my friends , we have to have a strong Europol , yes , we have got to work towards that and , yes , we must look to cooperate where it is in the best interests of everyone . #% How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC ? #% I shall not attend such a meeting because it seems to me you should make a ruling from the Chair and we should be done with the matter . #% A Commission declaration attached to the new DCI will contain , also for the first time , the benchmark that the Committee on Development has been using since 2003 to promote increased focus on the key MDG sectors of basic education and basic health , and the Commission has never before accepted the Committee 's 20 % benchmark for these sectors , which has been accepted on this occasion . #% The longer the conflict continues , the more it becomes a source of regional instability . #% Under Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure , there has to be an exchange of letters between the European Parliament and the Italian Government so that we can actually confirm his entitlement to vote and if that is the case , of course , it is a valid vote . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , as PPE-DE Group members will know , I recommended that we reject this amendment because I felt it was too prescriptive . #% This is why I welcome this communication , which seeks to put in place procedures to deal with out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes . #% Literacy rates need to be improved , especially in the context of the elections where literacy was a huge problem . #% If no measures are taken , the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50 % above the 1995 levels by 2010 . #% Madam President , I extend my congratulations and good wishes on your election as President of the European Parliament . #% Mr Söderman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe . #% We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time . #% I recognise that it is not an easy task because chemical precursors have a legal use as well as being a key part of illicit drug production . #% And the matter does not end there . #% They fly flags of convenience and then , when they break the rules , Member States , for example Spain , turn around and say : ' Oh , well , it was flying a British flag ' , when the reality is that it was a Spanish-owned vessel . #% While free movement facilitates trafficking in terms of the removal of border controls , on the other hand , one would imagine that increased police cooperation should be in a position to tackle the problem . #% The Members States of the Union must set up a public oil holding body and there must be harmonisation and coordination of crisis measures at European level . #% Where should we go to from here , is now the essential question . #% in writing . - The Youth on The Move ( YoM ) programme represents an opportunity to unleash the potential of young people and enable them to contribute to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in the EU . #% The debate and discussions generated by the Green Paper will be incorporated into the Commission 's White Paper for consideration by the Council this year . #% However , we must all work to ensure that air accidents are reduced to a bare minimum . #% Preceding the downfall of the Roman Empire it was customary to take out the imperial decree , unroll the great scroll of purple and gold , read it , have it copied and distribute it - and nobody took the slightest notice of it . #% While I have registered serious concerns about what I viewed as the reported lack of tolerance expressed by my former colleague Mr Buttiglione -- a PPE-DE colleague for the last five years -- in his statements on certain issues such as Baltic minorities , homosexuality and sinning , single mothers and fathers , I agree to support his candidature on balance . #% The European Union approach must be governed by three key principles : ensuring safe water supplies , arresting the decline of water quality and the restoration of polluted waters . #% You have to be able to give adequate answers to the sort of hostile newspaper articles which are in the United Kingdom 's press today , for example . #% . -- Mr President , this report deals with the Commission 's review of the multi-annual guidance programmes . #% If they can be encouraged to give their support by starting their training in schools , the good practice will be continued in the home . #% The United States has endorsed the Israeli position . #% Why are we having these draconian measures placed upon our farmers when they do not need it or want it , and when all they want to do is produce good food ? #% It is quite interesting that you recognise such potential actually exists . #% Of course this is not something that we can act on alone and we hope we will win the support of other Member States for this approach . #% The UK continues to have a flourishing trade in British-made military goods . #% Justice , it seems , is eluding these brave people and so they have come to us . #% If they have unemployment - and it is , I have to say , then new to them - they look after their unemployed better than do other countries . #% This is a whole area which will become much more centre-stage in the context of enlargement because there will be , in the context of the Union , that much more pressure from Member States to accommodate minority languages . #% Therefore , now that the trial has come to a conclusion , it is very important , Mr President , that you , on behalf of the Members of this House , intervene on their behalf - as the British Government is doing in many cases where its own citizens are in difficulties . #% Much of the discussion in committee centred around transport of mature animals for slaughter on mainland Europe . #% Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Caspian Sea . #% The consequences for farm income , and by implication the agricultural budget , are difficult at this time to comprehend . #% This must have been very difficult for the rapporteur in face of Members of this Parliament who want to drag their heels for the benefit of the packaging industry . #% Having struggled with the budget of the energy programmes over the last two years I was aware of that lack . #% This is a clear response to those who argue for an undue focus on short-term cuts to expenditure , which could in fact jeopardise longer-term growth . #% Mr President , I want to remove the second part of the amendment because apparently a lot of people would support the first part , but not the second part . #% Further debate on these topics will be led by the presidency which will seek to build on the experience and expertise gained to date and will try to construct a common approach to social exclusion and poverty . #% Yet , within two years , Commissioner Mandelson seems to be prepared to sacrifice the European model of agriculture in order to hammer out a deal at the WTO , by forcing farmers to bear a disproportionate share of the burden . #% But so be it . #% 
I know what I am talking about in this regard . #% A special Euro barometer on EMF indicated that Europeans are divided in their concerns about the potential health risks of EMF : 14 % not at all concerned , 35 % not very concerned , 35 % fairly concerned and 13 % very concerned . #% We find it incredible that so many MEPs would reject measures to ensure that public health is protected . #% It is quite interesting when you look at the figures , which show that 70 % of the workforce that will be employed in the year 2010 is already at work , but only 20 % of the technology which will be used in that year is available at the present time . #% Finally , we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today . #% Please believe me when I say that I do not believe that the Irish people wish to deny the accession countries the opportunities and support that we as a small under-developed country have experienced and put to great use over the last three decades . #% However , I believe that the Parliament needs to review our entire working methods and staffing with a view to improving our effectiveness and efficiency . #% I am concerned about the role of Parliament in this whole process . #% I think it is very timely , and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone , because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection . #% The Haitian Ambassador attended when I launched that particular book . #% Against this background I caution against any attempt to radically alter the administration and structure of the agricultural budget agreed in Berlin . #% This , I hope , will have a particular impact on emerging cooperatives in the accession countries and serve also to strengthen the European social model throughout the enlarged Union . #% In the case of Ireland , we export young animals for finishing ; so live transport is essential and central to the agricultural economy . #% Indeed , at present , some Ulster fishermen are awaiting trial in Liverpool Crown Court . #% There is pretty much universal agreement that this deplorable situation is due to the excess capacity of the world 's fishing fleets . #% We have a multi-pronged approach , we spend millions and millions on research into renewable energy . #% In addition , will he guarantee that this unit will provide the appropriate parliamentary committees with all the relevant information including analyses , recommendations and strategies on any potential crisis which should be monitored by this Parliament . #% So the 1 April deadline still looks rather ambitious . #% The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are not the only matter up for discussion within the Middle East . #% On that basis and according to what everyone else has said , I appeal to colleagues for support for the legal base of Article 175 tomorrow , with the proper Commission policing -- please -- of the internal market , as required of them under Article 176 . #% Yet within four days of our preliminary report being published in Islamabad you effectively distanced yourself from our conclusions that it was a seriously flawed process . #% The deluge in neighbouring Kilkenny is the worst in 60 years ! #% There are no quick fixes and we can not overstate the importance of the alliance-building that has been done to date with the support of the International Fund for Ireland . #% Live exports are an important feature of Ireland 's cattle sector . #% That is why I am heartened by the fact that Thabo Mbeke has met with Morgan Tsvangirai , the head of the opposition in Zimbabwe . #% Commissioner Byrne and his officials deserve great credit for their untiring efforts in this respect . #% We still have no answer on the issue of training compensation . #% One area which must be emphasized above all is transport . #% Today 's resolution is a relatively mild call on the Sri Lankan authorities to respect the rights of their citizens . #% Indeed , the President , Mr Barroso , said : ` nobody has a monopoly on truth ' -- and that includes the Portuguese Government and ` Women on Waves ' . #% When we look at what the Council agreed upon in Lisbon and the new European initiative in particular and consider utilising the advantages which would accrue to Europe from the telecommunications revolution , we can see that there are many great opportunities out there to be grasped , but they require proper order , proper rules and proper regulation to ensure their use for the benefit of all . #% Should we continue the emphasis on information and communication technologies which has been present in the fourth framework programme ? #% We must get intervention - medical and educational - to all those thousands of people , especially children who , since the New Year , have become disabled for life . #% In Ireland too we have our problems . #% Here I call on the Commissioner to target fleets which impose unsustainable pressure on key stocks . #% We are all disappointed at the rate of progress in the negotiations for the trade cooperation and development agreement with South Africa but it is important that the end result of the negotiations is an agreement which is beneficial to the long-term interest of both parties to these negotiations . #% Does he think that this policy needs to be reviewed and that an individual regulation to suit each Member State is required in the spending of structural funds ? #% Payments are the financial lubricants that allow the real economy to function . #% In exposing and standing up to the thuggery of Sinn Féin / IRA , the McCartney sisters have shown remarkable bravery . #% I went for a walk across the bridge from Strasbourg in France to Kehl in Germany and I stopped and meditated . #% It is extremely important therefore that the measures we are proposing here today are proportionate and justified , and are effective , not only in dealing with terrorism , but also in seeking to ensure that terrorism can not thrive . #% The illicit trafficking and transfer of young players across borders is a worrying issue . #% Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date . #% We need imaginative steps like this if we are to stand any chance of reducing the threat of global warming . #% What exactly is your intention in relation to that ? #% It is estimated by the Irish Exporters Association that a truck travelling from Ireland to mainland Europe via Holyhead and Dover will incur a road use charge of EUR 120 and an external cost of EUR 30 . #% Our task and role today is to listen to our Estonian colleagues and to hear their cries and their pleas for assistance and solidarity . #% I fully respect the Commission 's right of initiative , but I would urge that the Commission should not simply start in February with a general statement of priorities and then , in November , bring forward a specific work programme . #% The expansion of the single market should be of real and tangible interest to European exporters and to indigenous European companies seeking investment abroad . #% In these circumstances , full implementation of the Rail Package would result in a considerable burden on the administrations of these Member States without any of the benefits to consumers that the Package is designed to bring about . #% I warmly welcome this Green Paper as a European debate-launcher on learning disabilities , major depression , suicide , imprisonment of suffers and the affect of inappropriate imprisonment so that Member States can share research and best practice for the benefit of our citizens . #% This House has rejected that proposal again today . #% The beef crisis has already diverted attention from important work under way in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% But the resulting congestion now acts as a serious brake on further growth . #% In Ireland we have a commonly used phrase - `` if it is not broken , why fix it '' . #% We expect Member States to take their responsibilities seriously in both implementing and enforcing the ban . #% The European Union would make an important contribution to taking the deepest concerns of people everywhere in the Union seriously if it could produce a binding framework for the Member States . #% We are not combating global warming ; we are not dealing with the effects of the CO2 problem ; we are not researching and promoting renewable energy sufficiency and we are complacent on the issue of nuclear technology . #% However , considerable anxiety has been created in Ireland by irresponsible scaremongering on this issue by people fundamentally opposed to European integration , people like my colleague in this Parliament , Mrs McKenna of the Green Group , and the ethnic nationalists of the Sinn Fein Party in Ireland . #% However , it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete . #% The additional resources include an increase in the monthly assistance allowance available to MEPs to support their increased legislative role under the Lisbon Treaty . #% This is very important , because I believe that issues of taxation should be addressed by national parliaments and not decided centrally by the European Union . #% Ironically , the United States , the world 's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax . #% The fact that we are dealing here very often with delicate family matters is very often used by local police forces as an excuse not to become involved in these cases - that these are family matters and should be left to the lawyers to sort out . #% Specific safeguards are necessary in the health care sector . #% However , it is with some concern that I read in some newspaper reports back in Ireland that the Taoiseach is putting forward a suggestion for a European coastguard . #% 
AIDS , malaria and TB still claim some four million lives a year . #% Everyone recognises the need to control and monitor animal diseases , not only because of the human health implications , but also because of the economic consequences where there are outbreaks . #% Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects , we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages . #% It was not easy to decide on our tactics . #% It is also important that the European Commission strictly adheres to enforcing the principle of additionality through uniform verification methods . #% Next , as many speakers have mentioned , there is a need to coordinate the broad economic policies with regard to employment strategy , to ensure that the two match . #% Under the Amsterdam Treaty , Parliament has the power of codecision with the Council in the area of consumer protection and public health matters . #% If democracy and human rights were functioning in our Member States , then we would not have children going to school on bread and jam , and that is the reality of it . #% First of all , the only way we are going to solve the whole question of drug addiction and the health problems it poses is by reducing demand totally . #% In very simple and blunt terms , we are here today to try and pick up the pieces after what has been a bruising experience for all Member States within the European Union . #% I want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in Ireland . #% Now , just to get back to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty currently being negotiated in Geneva : there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests . #% Since January 2000 , there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults . #% As I said on a previous occasion we should not play God with research . #% This is a matter I will be raising directly with the Committee on Agriculture . #% My opinion is that we should not be using formula anyway . #% Like the rapporteur , I welcome the Commission scoreboard to measure the state of implementation of the action plan for the single market . #% Finally I have just come from a meeting of the Intergroup on Ageing . #% Plan Colombia will result in USD 1.3 billion from the US being allocated for mainly military purposes . #% We can not put one human life above another . #% Good for him . #% Madam President , the Tempus programme has been successful ; it has made a unique contribution to the third-level system of education in the countries of central and eastern Europe . #% What I welcome today in the Donnelly report and in the Commission 's earlier report , is that this is the type of strategy that enables . #% After the war in Iraq the Middle East region has become more unstable and it is incumbent on us all to ensure that we get the peace process in the Middle East back on track . #% Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks , and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry . #% If we sit back and allow Member States to stall on the current directive , by not putting pressure on them through a new directive , we would be making a grave mistake . #% Finally , I want to congratulate the Commissioner . #% In this regard , I want to recognise the work of Mr Harbour in particular , who has put an enormous amount of effort into bringing the compromise wording this far on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . #% I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this , by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty . #% Groundwater is a major national resource . #% Hopefully , the collective will of the young people in particular will be listened to at Gleneagles . #% Ninety per cent of our total beef production and 80 % of our milk production is exported . #% These instruments have proven popular with consumers and producers alike . #% The Daphne Programme will aim to promote information campaigns on potential risks of violence and ways of avoiding them , encourage pilot projects and innovative measures and help to create a Community information source to assist NGOs . #% These are some of the areas which featured most prominently in recent street disturbances and which show high levels of deprivation and neglect . #% Mr President-in-Office , we have heard your remarks on the EU-US agenda , and , as a member of this Parliament 's US Delegation , I can tell you that we have just returned from Washington , where we had meetings with members of the Congress , and a lot of our discussions obviously focused on the Helms-Burton legislation - legislation that is very damaging to our European interests . #% If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent , because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns . #% In this respect the role of the European Safety Agency needs to be increased in checking international standards and issuing certificates of approval . #% She was given no assistance in spite of the fact that both Mr di Pietro and the bodyguard knew that Mrs Baldi was there as a guest of honour from this institution . #% There appears to be a total lack of understanding there of what postal services are all about . #% Ireland gains because it has a surplus in its trade with the rest of the Community , except the British . #% I want to thank the Commission and my colleagues for highlighting the terrible ills that face us in the world and for trying to raise awareness of the appalling vista that lies ahead . #% We have received assurances by the Turkish authorities of their intention to pursue the process of constitutional and legislative reform . #% It has already been said that promises were given in this House by the Commission that it would undertake a social and economic impact study into the abolition of duty-free sales . #% It is the fifth fuel - coal , gas , renewables , nuclear - the fifth fuel , with a 30 % potential , is energy efficiency . #% Decisions on taxation policy are best left to individual Member States . #% I would like to know from the Commission why it considers this undesirable now , after almost twenty years ? #% If we really want to exercise influence on the world stage , then EU leaders must agree on merging the functions of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations , served by a single administration , adequately resourced , and using all our instruments in the policy areas - such as trade , development , environment , justice and home affairs - to support clear political objectives at the heart of our foreign policy . #% I ask the Commissioner today , who has been doing an extremely good job , to consider increasing the level of sampling as an initial step . #% We need other measures as well as this directive . #% Unfortunately , there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of Tamils in Sri Lanka . #% Since the tragic killing of Robert McCartney , I am concerned that politicians have pushed their own electoral agenda in the context of the recent elections and have lost sight of the real point of all this . #% Some in this House - I believe from the outset that they have been a minority , though perhaps rather vocal in terms of the media - have talked of targeting individual nominees . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as I agree with the fundamental point that there should be ` transition ' regulation in this sector . #% Irish farmers are worried that beef and dairy will be sacrificed next , in an effort to get trade concessions in services . #% The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time . #% In my own country the government failed to take recommendations and even directives seriously and implement them in a way that actually achieves their original aim . #% It is in all our interests to encourage these countries to reach their maximum potential as soon as possible . #% It must release Palestinian monies and it must face an international inquiry into its actions in relation to Lebanon . #% We all need to put beyond doubt the absence of a cost factor in the exchange mechanism . #% Secondly , the establishment of a relationship between financial compensation for fishing rights and payment for development is an improvement in the agreement . #% Considering that we are voting on the Reding report on terrorism today , it would be appropriate for this House to commemorate and pay tribute to the victims of state terrorism , as well as all forms of paramilitary terrorism in our fight to ensure that people 's lives and the right to life is secured for ever . #% Thank you , as Enda Kenny said recently in the Dáil , to the Permanent Representation and all the civil servants behind the scenes who made this technically a very good presidency . #% Others would cite a much higher figure . #% The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage , as we have already heard , the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy , particularly fossil fuels and nuclear . #% I hope that when a similar situation arises following the next intergovernmental conference , our procedures are changed to facilitate such a vote . #% 
From this table , you will see that , although there has been an overall increase over previous protocols , there has been a reduction for a number of stocks . #% He used a STOA inquiry which is exactly what we should do in this Parliament to test our views . #% These are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable . #% Mr President , I have recently returned from Sri Lanka , where I was continuing my engagement with the peace process at the invitation of those involved . #% I expect the elections next week will result in Hamas being elected and represented . #% Madam President , today we again debate human rights across the world and point out the deficiencies of others . #% As to your answer , I disagree with its contents . #% If you do , you will ultimately face the same fate . #% Mr President , the new directive calls for a uniform , transparent and flexible regime for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to facilitate the free movement of qualified persons within the enlarged European Union . #% author . - Mr President , I initiated this urgency resolution in order to exert political and public pressure on getting the EU peacekeeping mission to the eastern Chad border region deployed as soon as possible . #% The people within Europe today did not vote against more jobs , did not vote against better social protection , did not vote against better trade , did not vote against better Community development programmes , did not vote against giving more aid to the developing world , did not vote against protection for our environment , did not vote against ensuring sustainable development in fisheries and other industries . #% Enlargement on 1 May 2004 will strengthen our voice and position on the international stage in favour of Kyoto . #% You may say that this point is not relevant to this debate , but I put it to the House that unless we can ensure the conformity , viability and profitability of the production base of Europe 's food sector , we are unlikely to reach the standards to which we aspire . #% Surely it should have been the other way around . #% If we have a common European corporate tax regime , we will lose one of the greatest factors in maintaining our economic independence and our current state of prosperity . #% Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million . #% She will probably tell you that the shape of our roads is inadequate . #% Furthermore , a timescale has to be brought in . #% The Irish Government and other EU governments must also retain discretion at a national level over the participation in any future military operations . #% We need to learn from the failures and mistakes of EU laws . #% Lest this should get out of hand , my appeal would be for a calm assessment of the matter , to make an evaluation and find a way forward . #% We should also have the humility to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five-year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were . #% It is unfortunate that during the many months - almost one year - that have passed since the first discussion of the dossier in committee , interinstitutional negotiations have not made any progress . #% They can not both be right . #% I am pleased to acknowledge the introduction of an Innovation Alliance between UCD and TCD in Ireland , which is a fine example of investing in researchers at the beginning of their careers . #% We must not get to a situation where Member States are able to draw false conclusions , undermining our spending programmes where we know that they are vital to citizens ' opportunities . #% Last week a family with five special needs children had their children taken from them . #% That is what we all want to do . #% I am not at ease with voting for Niebler but it is a better ethical position than creating new embryos for destruction . #% I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market . #% The revenue secured by patents and by licensing out our inventions to our global competitors gives us a return on the investment and assists us in creating jobs and growth . #% I very much regret that and I have already assured him that I will use my offices to try to resolve that difficulty . #% That is my one criticism still that , in this respect , we want to go it alone in Europe , rather than operate a worldwide basis in relation to this . #% in writing . - How is this still going on ? #% The circumstances of Robert McCartney 's murder shocked very many people . #% The Commission proposal would allow for the product to only be used in pre-packaged , clearly labelled combined meat products with the name of the enzyme , thrombin - a blood-derived product - in the list of ingredients . #% Now , that is a gross distortion of the treaties which are neutral as regards where aid or money should come from to assist the aviation industry . #% We already have a truly great Constitution , for which Irish men and women laid down their lives , a Constitution which gives us a genuine foundation for real and respectful cooperation with our European neighbours . #% Owing to technological progress , those ideas on children 's rights must now also be linked into cyber security , as we have seen the Internet -- despite its wonderful intent , brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all -- being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs want to see improvements in the Single Market and to facilitate cross-border transactions for consumers and small businesses . #% What I want to say is that we should try to find a solution . #% We must meet our Kyoto commitments : we have international treaties and obligations under them and it is time that we took this more seriously . #% I do not want to see a repeat of the Cancun round of WTO talks , which was a lost opportunity and , indeed , set progress back in this regard by at least two years . #% It is up to the 15 Member States of the European Union to implement the provisions of this recommendation . #% I agree with his observation that while the human rights dialogue could indeed be useful , unfortunately up to now it has not produced tangible results . #% This time , in the United Kingdom and elsewhere , many of the headline writers point to the fight to save duty-free sales . #% Certainly , what is happening does not reflect the European aspiration to unity . #% That is the period in which Scottish and Irish fishermen sell a lot of their produce and the prices at the end of the year are extremely important to them . #% Indeed , most of the research effort in the field of neurodegenerative diseases is carried out by Member States , with a relatively low level of transnational coordination , leading to fragmentation and limited sharing of knowledge and best practices among Member States . #% Could I ask if that is the situation ? #% My group will be supporting its general tenor . #% However , in spite of these concerns , which I hope to alter by amendment later via the legislative process , I vote in favour . #% Look at what happened in the last GATT round : the EU traded in a principled way our agricultural rights for other non-agricultural areas . #% People who did not own property were living in ravines and on the sides of mountains , in shacks and in any thing they could put together , because they did not own the property in which they were living . #% While the Russian authorities condemn Chechen resistance fighters on the one hand , on the other hand they support ` resistance fighters ' in parts of Georgia . #% I continue to be perplexed at our Taoiseach 's attempt to once again play the neutrality card in Barcelona in an effort to get the Nice Treaty supported . #% Biofuels offer excellent new opportunities and can utilise the expertise notably of Irish tillage farmers . #% We are not prescriptive in the manner of achieving this . #% We are calling for this in the context of the UN 's responsibility to protect , based on the failure of the Sudanese Government to protect its own population from war crimes and crimes against humanity , and a failure to provide humanitarian assistance to the population . #% It is good that we have recognised the need to test children 's medicine specifically for children . #% Across Europe and the world , it behoves us all to stand resolutely against it and its despicable apologists . #% However , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern . #% Over the past year in the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies we discussed various ways of finding answers to these medical problems . #% In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern . #% For some of us , that is closer than for others . #% We have to be frank about this . #% 
There is no reason why animal protection can not be a legitimate reason for adopting trade restrictive measures . #% We have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world . #% Countries on the periphery , such as Ireland , with extensive sea coasts must be supported at EU level in their efforts to track and intercept drug-smuggling . #% We need to look seriously and seek to engage with those sections of the communities of Europe that are alienated to the point of murder and terror . #% The Conservatives should accept the verdict of this report and address the issues . #% However , it must not get bogged down debating institutional points concerning relationships , for example between NATO/WEU , and the national idiosyncrasies of some Member States relating to their security obligations . #% As long as we have surpluses this system will be necessary . #% We have brought ourselves to the point of accepting that , although it may not come out of the IGC , for indirect tax , but not yet for direct tax . #% The future is running fast to meet us and we still have no clear analysis of the impact of EMU on our regions . #% Because we need to do much better than this . #% You also , if I understood the translation correctly , believe that the Treaty should be simplified but without changing its content . #% Secondly , with regard to the question of junior doctors in training , it was unfortunate that when the original working time directive was proposed by the Commission , this sector was excluded . #% The Commission should have stuck to its original position and the Socialists should not have done a U-turn on this issue either . #% Notwithstanding by feminist credentials , I have to say that I still believe that the family is the most satisfactory and effective social union for the care both of the young and the old . #% If we had had a referendum in Ireland on that , rather than on the Treaty of Nice , it would have received 100 % support . #% We hope that the EU draws a lesson from this whole experience . #% While I was speaking I said that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is in Dublin this evening meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister . #% Today , what we are talking about , to put it simply , is the ownership of ideas . #% Mr Cappato asks , ` When will the Council raise this issue with the competent US authorities ? ' #% The construction company that dealt with it is still waiting for quite a considerable amount of money , and since it is a small construction company from Northern Ireland , the long delay in payment is also causing problems there . #% We want a simpler and more certain tax-based definition than that proposed by the Commission . #% The next section relates to the death penalty , an area where the European Union has had a lot of success in influencing its neighbours through the Neighbourhood Policy and has brought about a moratorium on the death penalty in many countries . #% author . - I want to ask the Commissioner if he will look at the non-direct financing aspects of the problems that SMEs are encountering . #% Can we take the moral high ground , when the European Union , in the interests of profit - and profit alone - is selling weapons and instruments around the world with which to inflict punishment and death on people We have to look to ourselves first and see what we are doing to fuel human rights abuses in the world . #% Secondly , environmental standards . #% Suicide rates increase with age . #% If we are going to put in place comprehensive marketing campaigns to warn young people of the dangers of smoking , we need the necessary financial resources to oversee such a programme . #% Having said that , I am all for balancing the taxation structure of motoring in order to decrease emissions - carbon emissions and particles and NOx and all the rest , but how that is done in each Member State is up to each Member State to decide and this is what we must be very careful about . #% We have to do it by , in the first place , seeking to construct a unity in the European Union . #% For the large majority the issue was peaceful and proper demonstration . #% That is the major reservation that I have about what we are proposing here tonight . #% You say it is not for the Council to monitor but who is monitoring it ? #% The few words I have said about Martin O'Hagan are entirely inadequate to convey the shock and the horror that people of all political and religious persuasions in Ireland feel at this horrible deed . #% Given the steps taken by Russia recently and the vulnerability of some Member States to Russian petulance , would the President-in-Office not agree that the essential element of maintaining security of supply lies in the complete liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union , and will he take steps to bring that about ? #% Thirdly , a very solid and continuously evolving education and training system , because the real tools we should use to adapt our workforce to the present , as well as future , conditions are those of education and knowledge . #% The promotion of cosmetic surgery in general is a major problem . #% I believe that all of us who are committed to resolving this issue now have a profound responsibility to work together in a cohesive manner , with the interests of the consumer and producers in mind . #% I hope that in the very near future - possibly in the autumn - the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy will take an initiative and we will have a much more comprehensive report to deal with the many concerns which this House and indeed I myself , as rapporteur , have relating to Hong Kong . #% I would reiterate in conclusion my support for the use of OIE provisions to have an internationally recognised basis for classification , a basis supported by 150 countries in resolving world trade disputes and recognised by the WTO . #% The difficulty , however lies in bringing them together . #% Mr Quinn , the Finance Minister , has described EMU as fundamentally a political project , but he has failed to identify any political benefits which will come from it , or allay fears that it will simply widen the gap between rich and poor . #% In this regard I have proposed tomorrow two amendments to item 2 and item 3 , adding a word : `` to ensure that EU-funded programmes do not cause ` unauthorised ' damage or destruction to actual or potential protected sites '' . #% Mr President , this hygiene package consists of a number of elements , all of which are very important : a proposal on general food hygiene , a proposal on food and animal origin and a proposal on official controls mainly concerning slaughterhouses . #% It is important that we have a dialogue not only with Kosovo but also with Serbia , to give them the encouragement to move forward and to find a new path in the nation-building process . #% The Commission 's role as Guardian of the Treaty and initiator of legislation is fully respected by this House and does not need to be constantly reiterated . #% While recognising that it may be a diplomatic formality , as we say in the resolution , at the same time it is very effective and signals a change of opinion in the United States . #% This view was made plain in Council working groups and was reflected in the final draft Presidency Proposal , a draft that is supported by the vast majority of Member States . #% There will be more detailed financial provisions : the financial provisions of the proposal were another area of very serious concern for the Committee , as they were extremely general and very far from the level of detail to which Parliament , as part of the budgetary authority , was accustomed . #% Unlike some other speakers , I consider it necessary and timely . #% There is no case for breaking these agreements . #% Back in the 1950s , at the time of the Euratom Treaty , there was an optimism about nuclear power which was , frankly , unrealistic . #% More work needs to be done in the area . #% We must also acknowledge that an EU defence policy must be underpinned by a coherent common foreign and security policy . #% We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred . #% However , let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation - the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act , making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites . #% The scientific studies commissioned by the Commission highlighted a number of key hazards relating to PVC , in particular during disposal . #% The Constitution is a dream that we need to have put into practice . #% This is not the only brutal murder that has , unfortunately , taken place on our island in the last 30 years ; but this one has caused many across the world to sit up and recognise the activity that is continuing in Ireland seven years after the historic Good Friday Agreement . #% I was very impressed at the beginning of the year to hear from the German Presidency that they would forward the ACP papers to Parliament in the same way as they had forwarded the papers for the Asian and Latin American countries . #% The common organization of the market in beef is an important measure in the overall framework of the common agricultural policy and is of great importance to my country , Ireland , where beef production is one of the main farm enterprises . #% You put tremendous effort into it . #% Mr President , it is absolutely unacceptable that more than 600 people , including children , have been held for two years in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial , in circumstances which no democratic state could legitimately stand over . #% In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas . #% I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress . #% When it comes to shipbuilding itself , I also think that we need to look at what kind of shipbuilding takes place . #% Respect and tolerance are needed more than anything else now . #% 
It is particularly important in this critical phase of talks for the EU to continue its commitment and for the International Fund to give a signal to our international partners that we still need to underpin the peace process with grass roots projects . #% However , in the case of Sweden , they have nudged the Community more towards the whole question of openness and transparency and have been among the leading Member States in putting this item on the agenda . #% Mr President , I would like you to take up this matter with the Italian authorities to secure an apology for Mrs Baldi from the appropriate authorities and Mr di Pietro . #% Amendments by the European Parliament have ensured that the importance of European cinema is being recognised under the MEDIA programme for the purpose of intercultural dialogue , linguistic and cultural diversity and non-discrimination . #% Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what I am really saying to you Commissioner , and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again : There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen . #% Let us put the past behind us and start with a clean sheet of paper . #% Second , our citizens ' attitudes to the euro reflects the economic situations in their own countries and their insecurity about their futures , pensions , jobs for their children and many other issues . #% This is excellent work done by this Parliament . #% We also have to address that in a serious way if we are to get to the root of this problem . #% A possible solution , following a comprehensive impact assessment , would appear to be incorporation of aviation into a reviewed existing ETS , with the proviso that all flights landing and taking off in Europe must be included . #% Commissioner , that was a very long , quite technical answer . #% Mr President , I commend Mr Liese for his dedicated work on this very sensitive and technical subject . #% It was with American aid that a shattered Europe was able to reconstruct and develop in the post war years . #% But really the strategy here is to pretend that there is no alternative and to try to force the Irish people into saying ` yes ' to something they have already said ` no ' to . #% With all due respect to Mr Stevenson , who is a good representative of his people and very enthusiastic , I do not accept that the common fisheries policy is a failure . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur , Professor MacCormick , for his work on these two very difficult and contentious reports . #% The suggestion put forward by some Member States that EU spending should be frozen at current levels until 2006 means , in effect , that the richer Member States are seeking to have the cost of enlargement met by the less-developed countries . #% It is also important that consumers have sufficient information and legal redress , either through the law courts or through ADR systems . #% Madam President , I am hoping that East Timor will be top of Ireland 's agenda on foreign policy during the Irish presidency . #% The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient . #% Increasing security , logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the NGOs on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse . #% Finally , on this day we remember the victims and their families whose lives have been shattered . #% Paragraph G is inaccurate . #% In the late 1980s and early 1990s a voluntary group called the Chernobyl Children 's Project was set up in Ireland by one woman who saw the horrors of Chernobyl . #% We need industry to go out and sell renewable energy . #% How many more times do we say `` never again '' before we actually take a decision to ensure that when we make a promise like that we will keep that promise and plan to keep that promise ? #% At a time when many of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East , we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living . #% In particular how can entrepreneurs learn from mistakes and failures , and if they fail once , be encouraged to continue and learn from those mistakes ? #% I want to go back to the area of the correlation tables . #% The other thing the Indonesians have to realise is that we need people to have access to East Timor . #% So we go back now to the Conference of Presidents , because that is where the pressure for this particular rule came from . #% I support the content of this report , however I do not feel that Amendment 21 proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which calls on the European Commission to identify measures to coordinate Member States ' fiscal policy and taxation , has any place in a report which purports to encourage innovation and competitiveness ; on the contrary it is only by fostering a greater sense of competitiveness between SMEs and other businesses across the EU in terms of their differing fiscal obligations and other variable market conditions that a truly competitive and innovative market will become a reality for all European businesses . #% The Commission has been found guilty of malpractice . #% I wish Sri Lanka well and I would urge all the political leaders on the island and its citizens to support this peace process and cherish the hope that it will bring permanent peace to their country . #% The guilty people continue to walk the streets of their community and to associate with their political family despite the pretence of disowning them by the Sinn Féin leadership . #% It will take a lot of courage to stand up to the nonsense that goes on about those pretty animals . #% We demand fiscal neutrality of the states . #% If my memory is correct , he won three times in all . #% What we now need to see is the practical and rapid implementation of these action plans . #% Consumer confidence in beef is at an all-time low , and consumers expect and deserve better from us . #% We are particularly concerned about depleted uranium because depleted uranium is a small-scale nuclear weapon . #% This Parliament rightly objected very strongly and criticised all those who were involved in terrorist acts , called for solidarity amongst Member States and amongst all the institutions of the European Union and sought to ensure that we could cooperate to fight the evil of terrorism . #% In Ireland we seem to think that all the so-called ` better jobs ' are the future and unwisely we starve out family farming . #% Apparently , a contract has been signed by a new travel agency to replace Wagonlit . #% This resolution seeks to encourage initiatives and action and ask the Commission to help perhaps with financial mechanisms to support the re-settlement of these people . #% We are retracting from milk , poultry and grain markets , not to mention beef . #% In today 's Times newspaper UEFA and FIFA are clearly indicating that this will lead to lower transfer fees , which has a knock-on impact , particularly for smaller clubs in my area . #% These small quantities are further diluted to almost non-existence . #% In short , the consumer must at all times be given a choice . #% The Commission indicated that it will be modifying its proposal on the performance reserve . #% It is important that these negotiations are undertaken in a calm and rational manner . #% Mr President , I support the resolution before us today . #% Furthermore , the report refers to the fact that we should explore the possibility of using animal protein as a source of animal feed . #% Even in the Official Report it is not quite clear on some of the pages . #% If we want enlightened social policies , in the European tradition , we need to reform our economies . #% The UK would be in class 4 , Ireland would be in class 3 under either classification system , the SSC or the OIE . #% Mr Lechner should be aware that the judgement is interim and that we will not have a final judgement until the autumn . #% It would be very untidy of us as a parliament to vote on a contradictory text in light of this most recent information . #% Let me go straight to one particular point of concern for the agriculture budget , namely , the clearance of accounts line . #% The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time . #% These are all problems that Europe has to solve in partnership , not only between the Commission and Parliament but also between the Commission , Parliament , the Member State Governments and the Member State parliaments . #% We do not yet know the implications of this decision , which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme . #% In many cases I do not believe that we have a guarantee that the money has gone where we expect it to go . #% We urge the Commission to move as quickly as possible to amend the necessary regulation , to allow extrapolation , the use of passports for horses and to resolve the problem . #% Mr President , after the last vote , I would now ask that you put immediately to the vote the other amendments tabled by the other groups to the effect that we should not have a transitional period . #% It is very alarming that this Parliament , and indeed the EU institutions as a whole , have very little concern about the use of depleted uranium . #% 
I welcome President Santer 's initiative on territorial , regional and local employment pacts . #% I want to talk about some of the issues we dealt with , not in detail but just to give a flavour . #% in writing . - I voted for this report as the situation in Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe . #% I am sure he will be aware of efforts to reach agreement on the reform of the common agricultural policy in advance of the World Trade Agreement and the June deadline , which the committee has set . #% We have not taken that issue to hand satisfactorily . #% Funding will also be provided for conferences and seminars so as to promote educational and student mobility between the European Union and colleges around the world . #% If we want to be passionate , then let our passion be based on facts . #% This will allow passengers , as consumers , to exercise the choice perhaps not to drink alcohol , perhaps to take aspirin three or four days before flying or to wear these new compression socks which help regulate blood flow in the legs . #% The EU and EU Member States should also provide more finance for the care of survivors of torture . #% But the IAEA are now trying to do the same thing to others as they did to the children with thyroid cancer : they are effectively denying these people screening and treatment . #% I wish to raise the question with the President-in-Office of the change in American policy since we in the European Union changed the whole direction of the support we give to agriculture following the last round of GATT negotiations . #% The environmental benefit of their management , their energy and their skills is also being lost . #% It is very important that we have the opportunity to question the Commission on this sensitive issue and the issue between questioning and debate should not loom so large . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very objective report . #% We need a more independent investigation process . #% There may be some sense behind the suggestions , but it is not at all clear to us . #% The directive must make it mandatory for landfill sites to be located beyond a certain distance from residential areas . #% Would the Commissioner be in a position to say whether there is universal support for the ratification of the 1996 Hague Convention ? #% Good farming practice and a stable and experienced farming population are the best guarantee for what Europe needs , which is a safe , secure and healthy food supply . #% Issues such as continuing high levels of unemployment in some of the Member States , tackling poverty , combating discrimination on grounds of disability , promoting active ageing and providing childcare facilities are all important and need to be dealt with as priorities . #% We want child pornography on news groups blocked . #% So you must correct this if it is an incorrect reflection of your views in that interview . #% But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people . #% Some say they know the answer , but I have not come to any conclusion . #% It is clear that there is a great fear among many people , particularly the people who elected me , that this Charter will override national constitutions , in particular as regards the support and protection of fundamental institutions such as family , marriage and the protection of life , born and unborn . #% Force can not defeat force , but peace can be built on peace . #% The imminent reform of the CAP gives us a real opportunity to address these issues . #% From my own experience and my Green perspective , this is a very effective way to deal with these funds and can be more effective than national administration . #% Our quality food products are closely linked to our grass-based natural environment . #% There is no magic wand that we can wave to bring about a magic solution . #% I would agree with Dagmar Roth-Behrendt and others who have spoken here , that adults have free will to take up smoking or to take up drinking , but it is deplorable that young people are encouraged to take up smoking as the result of billboard advertising and advertising generally . #% Before making my contribution , I would like to stress that I am not speaking on behalf of the IND/DEM Group as it has no position on this topic . #% I am not in a position to hand down rulings that might be better sought from the Court of Justice . #% We have to thank the Commissioner himself , who has demonstrated commitment and dedication to this issue , and the Council and the Presidency again , which have made all this happen . #% While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported . #% Last-minute efforts to shelve the motion , without consultation , threatened to set a dangerous precedent that , in my view , would have significantly damaged the credibility both of the urgency procedure and perhaps , more importantly , Parliament 's work on human rights issues generally . #% The Lloyd 's petitioners are not only from the UK : they come from my country , Ireland , as well , and indeed also from Denmark and Germany , not to mention the investors who brought cases before the courts in the United States . #% Genetic research has much to offer mankind in alleviating disease , enhancing food security and quality and in the area of environmental protection . #% The reality , and I think the cause of the frustration that many dairy farmers feel , is that while they have seen to some extent what Mr Lyon referred to as the green shoots emerging , this money has not passed through into their bank accounts yet . #% It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system . #% I voted in support of this report despite some misgivings and concern with the overall thrust of the report . #% Mr President , I believe that both Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli would be very proud of the events of 1 May . #% The opportunities provided by this protocol for EU fisheries companies , combined with the process of privatisation in Chilean fisheries , threaten the sustainability of the artisanal fisheries sector . #% Mr President , I welcome this excellent initiative . #% These negotiations should not detract from one particular fact , namely that the enlargement of the Union will take place on 1 May 2004 . #% It is now proposed to complement this first initiative with a new directive that would address both mandatory and confidential reporting of incidents , defects or malfunctions which may constitute a hazard for civil aviation operations , called `` occurrences '' . #% We call for an immediate and lasting response to our parliamentary resolution . #% It is a new phenomenon to us , but it saddens me to see people that I believed to be decent and compassionate acting in a racist and xenophobic way - and that includes many of the people in my own constituency . #% The key issue now under debate is whether we should have a strict or a relaxed admission policy . #% There is a serious matter . #% I am opposed to nuclear reprocessing and I believe that all reprocessing plants in the UK and elsewhere should be closed . #% With its harmonization of the tax system , the EU is gradually assuming all the characteristics of a single state . #% And thirdly , an orientation of technological innovation in the less-favoured regions towards the promotion of sustainable development , promoting local skills and using local natural and human resources . #% Finally , Mr President , I feel that I must mention the questions to the Commission and in particular Question 53 by Mr Alf Lomas on racism and fundamentalism in Brussels . #% I share the concerns expressed by the Irish presidency and others that the timescale proposed under Articles 5 to 9 of the directive are simply not achievable . #% This approach is followed very successfully in the South Pacific on tuna and there is no reason whatsoever that it should not apply here . #% You have supported communities and shown faith with ordinary people in the border regions of Ireland . #% We welcome the green light given to Cyprus but it now requires a deeper EU-led engagement to resolve that problem under the aegis of the United Nations . #% I have always believed that if the EU requires that of farmers , it must pay compensation . #% People are dying in huge numbers and at some point the international community is obliged to act more firmly . #% I have tabled amendments in my report to underline my opposition to the patenting of software as such . #% When we see the children killed in Qana , all justifications seem petty and shallow . #% I do not dismiss the malign role of Hizbollah in all of this , nor indeed -- as has not been mentioned so far -- the malign influence of the United States in encouraging Israel in its actions . #% This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us . #% We need the release of all political prisoners , and we need to allow democracy to govern . #% It will be recommended to the producers of consumer goods to attach to their product a list giving at least one contact address in every Member State where the product is marketed . #% 
We are not thinking about the countries we are robbing of their people , because our motives are selfish : we need to look after our own . #% Any attempt by Israel to expel him from the Occupied Territories will only undermine the Palestinian Authority and will further inflame the security situation . #% I favour a substantial strengthening of EU-Saudi relations and urge the EU institutions to increase our presence in the region . #% I welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of TSEs in cattle and believe , Commissioner , that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in Member States . #% As a result of this new directive there will be a threefold reduction in the sulphur content of petrol in cars and a seven-fold reduction in the sulphur content of diesel by 2005 . #% The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one . #% However , it is a notoriously difficult area to enforce because of outside conditions , such as bad weather , that will affect the way fishermen operate . #% As a committee , we have re-tabled an amendment and are calling on Parliament to fully support this amendment . #% It will return a dividend . #% Over one half of the threat to the climate disappears if you use energy in a way that saves money - if , for example , your household appliances are efficient . #% We should enshrine fundamental rights for all citizens of the Union in the Treaty : the right to a decent income , health care , education , housing , work , training , welfare services , community and family life . #% These changes are needed immediately , otherwise there will be a further collapse in the market for beef . #% We do not find the answers in here . #% It must certainly be a source of great encouragement to you . #% After the attacks on the Twin Towers on that terrible day in 2001 , the United States concentrated on terrorism : where the next attack was coming from , homeland security . #% I support this programme because of its social values . #% Only last week Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries passed an amendment stating clearly that fish balances shall not be disturbed in western waters and therefore it is in this context that relative stability must be understood . #% In fact , 1 1/2 million cattle must be exported every year , both as beef and live cattle . #% Coming , as it did , on the back of BSE in the United Kingdom , this disease wrecked the rural economy and destroyed many farmers in the UK . #% The European Commission and European Parliament certainly want all Member States to take advantage of the cleaner new technologies which are coming on-stream to deal with the problem of waste management . #% The twenty-fifth of January is a date which will be etched in the memory of the Colombian people but , regrettably , for the wrong reasons . #% With regard to recital E in the compromise text I should like just to point out that I was not involved in the negotiations and I wonder if there would be any way of getting agreement on a change because there is an inaccuracy . #% The European Union was , in fact , very well placed . #% These immigrants are under-paid ; they are often housed in disgraceful conditions . #% What is important is that the EU directs funding for research across Member States to ensure we have a full and accurate picture of the scope of the problem . #% The report points the finger at Islam , fostering discrimination and undermining respect for different religions and cultures . #% By bringing the killers of Robert to justice , there is a bigger statement being made in terms of a total rejection by all decent people of this continued wanton killing , maiming and violence . #% They have been living in exile now for almost 30 years . #% Mr President , we welcome the recent announcement by the Americans that they are starting to think multilaterally once again . #% It must be painful for the Commissioner and Mr Jarzembowski to see such wide-ranging opposition to this proposal as there is here today . #% I should like to quote what you said about the technical assistance office for Leonardo : ` whether or not we continue cooperating with the technical assistance office in question will depend on a clear improvement in its management ' . #% Madam President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on this public health issue . #% The question of the changes which will take place over the next few years concerning the age profile in the European Union and the effect that will have is something which is concentrating all of our minds , not only because of the purely economic aspects - how we can pay the old age pension for people who are over 65 years of age , how we can have a new breed of workers entering the labour market to ensure that they pay enough social security etcetera - but there is also the great question of how we care for those who are elderly . #% The question at issue is whether , and if so under what conditions , a derogation may be made from the normal rules governing design protection , that is exclusive rights , to enable third parties to use spare parts without the authorization of the right-holder for the purpose of repairing complex products , such as motor vehicles . #% This is not just about protecting farmers ' interests ; it is also a very clear and important issue regarding food security , security of food supply and of the standard and quality of food , and security as regards ensuring that biodiversity and the available alternatives are maintained in the rural areas of Europe . #% This is an example of how Member States , having approved directives and transposed them , are failing to ensure that they are implemented . #% The problem we are dealing with here is deeply ingrained in our society , not just in far-off , distant societies which have particular religious views in relation to women . #% But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament . #% As regards additives in general , there is very little advantage to the consumer in the vast majority of them . #% It is not sarin gas which creates the spectacular death and destruction which the terrorists need for the 6 o'clock news . #% However , there is a lack of engagement with the European Union and often a lack of trust about where they see the European Union going . #% If you had a scenario where more science equals more growth , more consumption of natural resources , more unemployment for technological reasons and an increasing divergence between poor and rich people , poor and rich regions and poor and rich hemispheres of this world , it would be completely unacceptable and very dangerous . #% What Mrs Nicole Pery reported to the Bureau was quite simply that she had various documents from different groups and individuals and many varied suggestions on this particular matter . #% The St Malo Summit concluded that the EU needed , and I quote , ` strengthened armed forces that can react rapidly to the new risks and which are supported by a strong and competitive European defence industry and technology ' . #% The latest statement , for example , by a British scientist that the disease is transmitted by cows to their unborn calves is creating further doubts in the minds of consumers . #% The most important thing is that we reach a fair compromise that is the best option available for this House and for the citizens we represent , while noting what our colleague , Mr Szájer has said . #% All too often when there is one abduction there is a re-abduction by the other parent . #% Maybe there is a difference in language and interpretation and that what the President of the Commission meant to say was consolidation , or codification , which happens in every single government . #% I believe this to be a serious violation of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% In the last election my own party had a slogan which stated : ' A lot done , more to do ' . #% I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post-2013 . #% Each and every one of the students spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their community . #% By contrast , the rapporteur Mrs Liotard has worked hard to add some substance to the proposal . #% I had requested an explanation of vote for the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party on two reports . #% We must be able to offer industry and SMEs a better deal to ensure that the protection of intellectual property is genuinely an opportunity to create and encourage innovation . #% But precisely because of these potential programming delays it is important that in Parliament 's priorities the idea of transitional programmes are the same length for all objectives : six years to allow regions coming off regional aid adequate time to put into place self-sustaining programmes by using financial opportunities of loans and venture capital . #% In my own country gang warfare , intimidation and shootings are becoming all too frequent an occurrence , particularly in my own constituency . #% Will you take on board the point that eggs within the EU produced unlawfully after 1 January 2012 will either have the same stamp , will not be allowed to be exported outside the country in which they are produced or will not be allowed to go onto the market ? #% Finally , I would urge that it is important that some of the undertakings by Member States to include renewables in the energy mix in the electricity sector be at least equal to the total EU commitment made in the White Paper on renewable energy , as endorsed by the Council and this Parliament . #% For many years Mr Tom Hyland , an Irishman who has made this the cause of his life , has led international demands for action on East Timor . #% If not , thousands of workers will be added to our shameful statistics . #% I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter , namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties . #% I had the opportunity to visit refugee camps in Thailand that are overflowing with people who have fled from Burma 's Karen province and Karenni province . #% Our electorate does not think that much of us that it wants the privilege of paying to have us as European political parties . #% First of all , on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , I should like formally to move the oral question , the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention . #% I want to focus on improving better regulation for the internal market and ensuring that we achieve a sense of purpose in our law-making for consumers in the internal market . #% 
In the streets of Hong Kong we saw Korean farmers fighting for their livelihoods , small Korean farmers threatened by transnational grain corporations which are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries . #% While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position , I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit . #% I appeal for honesty in the presentation of this Constitution , for recognition that it is a charter designed to facilitate and build a European superstate with ever-diminishing national powers and ever-increasing centralised powers and all the apparatus of statehood . #% in writing . - I support this report , which highlights that precarious work disproportionately affects women workers . #% I believe the outermost regions of Europe should be given the required support that they need where possible in order to compensate for their location and the difficulties that entails . #% In conclusion , I believe that these Commission proposals are just that . #% A major step forward was made for the European Union at the Lisbon Summit , in its commitment not only to a competitive , dynamic economy but also to a society which is cohesive and based on full employment . #% These were the main concerns expressed . #% The labour force is growing steadily and unemployment is at last beginning to fall , down from almost 16 % in 1993 to actually just over 11 % this year . #% With more help of that kind , people could actually keep their affected loved ones at home with them longer if they wanted to . #% The decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world . #% Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Pinheiro , I welcome this excellent report by Michel Rocard on a new cooperation agreement to replace Lomé 4 . #% That , after all , is an objective of the Lisbon process . #% All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity . #% Up to 60 % of the fish caught are canned , as Mrs Stihler has said , and much of that is eaten by us in the northern hemisphere . #% I hope that he can ensure that any new Treaty will provide the legal framework needed successfully to fight organized crime and the drug trade . #% I understand that Commissioner Van Miert has already signed an agreement with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on making sure that these two maps are indeed coherent , and I wonder when you will refer that document to Parliament . #% However , I have one concern with regard to the question of a judgment that is not yet final : we are acting as judge and jury in denying somebody a right to be an applicant for a tender without having a final decision or analysis made as to whether that person is guilty of a crime or not . #% Given the protracted uncertainty that the failure to come to a decision on lifting the feed ban has caused to farmers and industry , I sincerely hope that this dossier will be adopted at first reading . #% I support wholeheartedly the report of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz ; except that I do not agree with her omission of domestic waste and will vote against it . #% At the same time , amongst the 7 200 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails , also held in breach of the Geneva Conventions , 1 500 are held for an indefinite period and 13 have already served 25 years . #% Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States , a third reading in conciliation was inevitable . #% Most synthetic drugs can be produced locally . #% As Mr Perry has rightly said , the people of Europe are effectively probing the laws of Europe , the directives of Europe and the issues that concern them most closely . #% Such action would clearly demonstrate the EU 's determination to make real and tangible progress on this all-important issue . #% The inescapable truth is that Sinn Féin , which masquerades as a democratic party and has two shameless Members in this House , is largely funded by organised criminal activity . #% So rather than repeat what has been said by other speakers , I just want to mention to the Dutch presidency two points on which I would like to see some action . #% The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing , positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy ; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about . #% I would like you confirm that it has done so . #% We need special courts that will deal with these issues as quickly as possible to prevent the inevitable trauma , particularly to the children , but also to both parents . #% Madam President , as you know I am a very enthusiastic anti-smoker . #% Clearly the way forward for an energy market such as the Irish one is through interconnection . #% However , I believe that the Commission is always under pressure to make excessive concessions to industrial fishing interests , and extending the right to fish for herring , even if some of it is of inferior quality , gives rise to serious doubts , even if Germany and Sweden did not catch their full quota in the Baltic . #% When an effort is occasionally made it is usually far too little and absolutely too late . #% The last point that I would make is that we should avoid using the -- Article 42 . #% As important as it may be for us to be prudent , prepared and aware of any dangers or risks that may present themselves , it is equally wrong of us to be scaremongering as regards any immediate threat and the dangers it presents . #% This includes a range of issues including the extension of qualified majority voting at Council level , the re-weighting of votes in the Council , the extension of codecision measures to the European Parliament and the reform of the European Commission . #% We have some concern about whether enough reflection has been given by Parliament - and certainly not enough in our own group - to say that we want to see majority voting in Council also for the area of direct taxation . #% There was some general agreement at the last meeting of EU foreign ministers , held in Rhodes on 3 May , that the EU must play a stronger role in the post-conflict situation in Iraq . #% My sole regret is that , to date , my region -- Northern Ireland -- has not yet availed itself of this facility , though I would have to say , biased as I am , that we are rich in such commodities . #% This is a human rights issue and the European Union has certain possibilities open to it . #% We must continue to enlarge and expand that role . #% However , I suppose we must be thankful that considerable progress was made at the Cologne , Faro and Helsinki Summits . #% Furthermore , we are calling on each Member State to ensure that convictions for such crimes are subject to the tracing , seizure and confiscation of all moveable and immovable assets representing the proceeds of those crimes . #% I want to hear from the Council today what role it feels it is prepared to accord to this House in terms of the scrutiny and accountability of issues which may be intergovernmental but which can not stand on one pillar alone ? #% But failure to act at all would be downright catastrophic . #% At my initiative , as rapporteur , I felt it was essential to reach a compromise with the Council on a second reading , and this package is exactly that . #% This round of trade talks must truly be a development round . #% In so doing , we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013 . #% Is its future to be shaped by people who genuinely subscribe to the Irish peace process and to the resolution of the problem in Ireland by democratic means , or are Sinn Féin and the IRA controlled by people who are prepared to tolerate and even support criminal acts of murder ? #% It is clear that the only way of breaking the current deadlock is through the intervention of a third party . #% In presenting this regulation to the public we should also highlight that this is probably the single most important piece of social legislation to come out of this Parliament and one that makes a real difference to people 's lives in that it reflects the realities in which the modern-day European Union citizen is working . #% Assisting developing countries in setting up fair and effective tax systems is another issue to be strengthened . #% Mr President , I should like to point out to the Commissioner that the Irish Government has mass-medicated my people with disodium monofluorophosphate for 40 years . #% With regard to the reform of the EU agricultural system , Commissioner Mandelson has succeeded in the negotiating mandate given to him by the EU governments . #% Let us look at the lessons . #% On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 . #% Also I want to emphasise that in 2004 Irish agricultural exports exceeded EUR 7 billion . #% For the first time ever an EU state was criticised unanimously , indeed reprimanded , by Ecofin . #% Not enough consideration has been given to criteria for granting aid . #% The Commission allows millions to be lost but has no consideration for those in the most desperate circumstances . #% Experience shows us that in the very short term they may succeed but the only thing those countries can do is to provide their own workers with lower standards of living . #% In this regard , it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost . #% In the interests of fighting international terrorism , these men should be returned to Colombia to finish the sentences they were given originally , and not be allowed to go free , as they are at present , to flout international will . #% All of us in this House -- if we are lucky enough to live long enough -- will grow old . #% The second concerns police information which is intended to assist in the gathering of data relating to counterfeiting at both strategic and operational levels . #% 
In relation to the institutional care of adults with handicaps , I visited an institution where 450 people were living in awful conditions , unacceptable to us here in the European Union . #% Their earnings are taken by traffickers , they are unable to speak the language and they are oppressed by the fear and the secrecy that surrounds this issue . #% Do not panic : the right people are on the job and hopefully we will have no more problems . #% In the report that has been presented there is no impact assessment , not even in respect of what the Commission describes as the engine for economic and employment generation in the Union : the SMEs . #% It has to stop . #% In this regard I compliment the Commissioner on his response to the most recent scare and share fully his views with regard to what has happened . #% The reality is that if any of us here won our national lotteries the likelihood is that we would invest it in property or something of that kind which we would get a return on and which would not require us to take on the difficulties of employment . #% I can not be repeated often enough : in an otherwise very successful city there are pockets of enormous deprivation . #% The Bulgarian criminal justice system has not given Michael a fair trial . #% We know the problems that the Member States have in their own waters , so it must be very difficult indeed for these other countries to be able to tackle these problems . #% This is extremely damaging to the health and safety of those workers . #% As the Rapporteur on EU-ETS , I am aware , as I hope we all are , of the need to act and act promptly if we hope to solve this challenge . #% The way forward for rural development is one of vision and confidence ; above all , we must look to the future ! #% For many valid reasons , we have had to emphasise the cause of women . #% The directive challenges the right of Member States and local authorities to regulate services . #% Mr President , I would simply like to place on the record the political view of the Liberal Group . #% I believe that the World Health Organisation has taken the correct approach on this issue . #% Perhaps they can find it out now . #% We need to have an illustrative renewables programme to counterbalance the illustrative nuclear programme which is produced . #% What has been the outcome of Mr Solana 's discussions and what response was received from the Iranians ? #% We have both retreated to hurling insults at each other across the Atlantic . #% Turkey is currently applying for membership of the EU and I support that move , but part of that process will have to be a requirement that major companies like Gama respect and protect workers ' rights within the EU . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate you on your election to your new post and I wish you well . #% There is no other way of ensuring that parties are not corrupted . #% I also thank Ms Malone for her good wishes . #% The President of our own Parliament said here today that there are 56 different directives dealing with the sale and production of goods for supply and for services . #% As the past months have shown , the importance of energy security has never been as acute . #% I do not believe that the troops in Iraq can oversee the peacekeeping efforts in that country . #% Apart from the political will not being there , the police will is not there either . #% I am delighted to hear that new initiatives are being undertaken in this area , because it is a growing problem . #% The European Union must be to the forefront in persuading our international partners to agree to all aspects of Kyoto . #% What will happen in relation to the education system in Iraq and how will it be reinstated ? #% It is necessary that provisions be made to compensate those affected by such designation . #% This was essential . #% I know that colleagues in Parliament are more than willing to contribute to such an exercise . #% Likewise , I found it particularly distasteful and very hard to watch the media coverage of a minority element at some of those demonstrations who were inflicting pain on themselves , especially young people . #% There is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises . #% Ireland has demonstrated how its young people are contributing in a major way to its significant economic growth . #% Each of us I am sure would wish to see action being taken to tackle the proceeds of cross-border crime and money laundering . #% We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels . #% Negotiations with the Council and the Commission - which should incidentally facilitate these negotiations - started in February 2010 . #% The problem was that they did not show any independence of mind in challenging culpable business partners and the executive board . #% Madam President , in the available time it is not possible to deal with the many challenges facing European agriculture or the role of farming as a central pillar in rural infrastructure . #% Listening to the debate here today , I am somewhat reminded of 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London . #% I am genuinely pleased with the response to it by the people who have already spoken . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to continue to champion this issue and emphasise it consistently in Göteborg , especially with a view to enabling the Irish to say `` yes '' to enlargement there . #% It is those kinds of skills that we sorely miss now that she is ex-chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs . #% Mr President , although Member State governments have strongly criticised human rights abuses , regrettably they adopt a different approach in relation to larger countries like China and Pakistan , where there are huge trading and geopolitical interests at stake . #% Like in many industrial sectors , businesses are relocating to countries where they can exploit workers to their own advantage . #% Secondly , it shows that , no matter how good your training or education or skills may be , there are people who will be caught in unemployment , and they must be guaranteed a safety net and security to allow them to have a proper and decent standard of living . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer . #% First I wish to reassure other victim parents , some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case , that their tragedies too are just as important to me . #% But they must speak with honesty , not using double-speak or with forked tongues . #% Therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs . #% We could and should have looked at issues like ` on call time ' in relation to home carers . #% Secondly , with regard to enlargement and integration capacity , particularly as regards Turkey , despite the efforts of some people to try to simplify the issue of Turkey in terms of being in favour of or against Cyprus , Cyprus is a single , separate issue . #% It is obvious from the opening speeches in this morning 's debate that the election campaign is already under way . #% In the absence of Mrs Damião , he has done excellent work in reaching the compromises which we have before us here in this debate . #% On ethics in biotechnology , the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings . #% More importantly , consumers continue to pay more and more for their food . #% The investment chapter would , outrageously , give corporations the right to sue governments when social or environmental policies cut across their profiteering . #% Mr President , I also wish to join in the congratulations to Sue Waddington on her report and to say that the Group Union for Europe will be more than happy to give full support to the report and all its contents , because it is a very balanced one . #% Mr President , on a real point of order , could you rule on whether or not Mr Watson 's intervention was actually a point of order ? #% Mr President , I want to congratulate President Santer on his continuing efforts to get national governments as well as the European institutions to give this serious problem the priority it deserves . #% Mr President , it is now exactly 20 years since I was lucky enough to get speaking time on my first day in Parliament . #% Enlargement in the wrong circumstances will certainly halt progress and will probably reverse it . #% 
It concerns the UK Charities Commissioner , in particular the Director of the Neurofibromatosis Association , and her information to this Parliament , for which she was later censured . #% There is very little competition in this field . #% They might have been brought up in religious fundamentalism and other cultures , where there was serious oppression of women and physical and sexual violence against women . #% Many of us do not understand why this could not have been done in seven minutes , because it is clear that we have principles . #% The directive can be seen as one of the basic instruments for an integrated product policy , where the whole life cycle of a product will be taken into consideration and eco-design can be promoted . #% In Ireland , as in many other places , we can not begin to deal with the problem of deteriorating human health or clean up our environment without tackling the problem of old mines and the waste that was left behind when the mines were closed and the mining companies dissolved . #% The problem with export refunds and the associated difficulty of developing third country markets had a bad impact on the profitability of the entire European beef sector . #% The current system has successful elements but it also contains flaws : surely it can not be right that the outdated , 13-year-old European Standard EN1384 ( Helmets for Equestrian Activities ) is still in use today despite concerns before its publication and 2 subsequent upgrade mandates from the Commission . #% It has been imposed upon them that they can not fish for about an 11 to 12 week period . #% Mr President , those who are resisting the notion of increasing the budget in this House should ponder one very stark statistic . #% The sums allocated in the Commissioner 's proposal for science and society were inadequate . #% It must also be made clear that the illegal movement of sheep by unscrupulous operators will not be tolerated . #% Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes . #% That is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end . #% On 6 November they reported that the Chilean Supreme Court had ordered Mrs Marin 's release within a day of her arrest and that General Pinochet had been persuaded that this was probably not the best way to approach this issue . #% It included a coalition of industry , waste-management , local and national authorities , environmental , health and consumer interests . #% As the Commissioner knows , there are regions which are not capable of taking down this funding , and obviously that imbalance will create uneven European development . #% I support a package of measures for our larger and busier airports covering aspects such as land-use planning and management , operational restrictions and a ban on the noisier Chapter 3 aircraft . #% The values of democracy were distorted , unwarranted concession after concession was made , but as each was pocketed , new demands appeared . #% This rules out the necessity of putting the designation on the front of the package . #% I would ask Members to support the resolution and our call for a full , independent , international judicial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case . #% Mr President , I also welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the common organisation of the market in sugar . #% Animals and , most importantly , people in the area suffer from an incredible range -- a tragic range -- of diseases , the kind that demonstrate an environmental attack on the immune system . #% They not only have the strong interest and support of citizens for their intrinsic value but they also have an important contribution to make to employment in our European regions . #% I endorse the recommendations in the report and I think the report clearly shows that cigarettes offer the fraudster a huge mark-up between the duty-free price and the actual sale price right throughout the European Union . #% I intend to vote against the proposed draft Council regulation because I believe that the technical details have not been properly or fully investigated . #% It is good to see that even although there is practically an empty Chamber they are still listening and taking note . #% It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas . #% Within the European Union these issues will continue to be raised and progress will be made . #% There are few areas where our policy pretensions and our actual effort stand in starker contrast than in the area of common foreign and security policy . #% No update has taken place . #% I warn that unless we become more vigilant and show a greater understanding of the unique and irreplaceable role of farmers in society , future generations and parliamentarians will be forced to react to save agriculture . #% This is clearly , therefore , the structure we should use in addressing global problems such as poverty . #% Regarding the Cartagena Protocol , it must be aid that our own European Commission tried to resist clauses to introduce Cartagena into the Directive 90/220 . #% Nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every Member State and they were not . #% We can at times hide behind the provisions of the Dublin Convention , which states that the first EU country that an asylum seeker enters must process their application for asylum . #% The Commission says that this is too difficult for all sorts of reasons , though it was one of the focal points in the recent partnership agreement discussion paper which the Commission produced . #% Among the measures used in different regions are : the use of observers to monitor a fishery and temporarily close it when there are too many small fish ; banning the discarding of fish ; and requiring the industry to submit plans on how they themselves will conduct the fishery in order to keep discards low . #% I fully respect your personal choice . #% We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2.2 billion . #% I believe it is very important that we all work together in a spirit of cooperation so as to ensure that the problems of social exclusion are solved within our community . #% Are we doing justice to anyone when we meet a delegation from India , say , or China once a year for one-and-a-half or two days ? #% For too long mental illness has not been at centre stage in our legislative process and , as is clear from the Commission 's Green Paper and its startling findings , public consciousness through more informed communication is slowly coming to realise that mental illness and its consequences affect the core of our population . #% The consumer must be able to see at a glance the certificate of origin which is the assurance of product safety . #% Lastly I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he would agree that this matter should now be raised within the UN Security Council . #% I will raise these issues at the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly in Jordan this weekend . #% Nine countries , including Ireland , Germany and Portugal , refuse to sign the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture . #% When the euro is launched it will be necessary to exchange money held in present currencies for the new currency . #% International cooperation is the bottom line . #% I hope that you will encourage cooperation between your staff , scientists and those involved in the industry . #% Now we are in the process of voting through a system that will provide confidence to consumers on a product-by-product basis , with nutritional and health claims based on scientific evidence . #% So for all of the reasons , it is very obvious that this EURES programme has enormous potential . #% Rebel groups are attacking relief agencies more frequently , forcing them to leave the area . #% I would say to the Commission that if we are to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of decision-making , we must reassure our citizens that their specific concerns have been taken into consideration . #% Papadimoulis report #% By addressing the issue of impunity and providing a fair forum for prosecutions , the court will help ease international tensions and promote peace and security , domestically and internationally . #% Confusion , however , was spread at a great rate by the fundamentalists of the left , by the fundamentalists of the right , by the cranks in the middle ; and the truth was not properly sold . #% It is all very well to speak of stringent controls , but you can not guard against human failure . #% I believe his own personal safety is at risk and I hope that when Parliament votes on this resolution that the Philippine Government will be made aware of the serious concern we have for Father Cullen 's personal safety and for his campaign to protect these very much at-risk children . #% Let me say that the criticism that appears to be directed at Mr Telkämper is totally unjustified . #% Mr Oostlander 's report is part of this approach at EU level and is to be welcomed . #% It treats the views of the outside world with contempt . #% Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised . #% The fishermen are looking for a fundamental review of the current quota system , they are looking for a review of the tie-up policies , they are looking for a review of the direction of the Common Fisheries Policy , they are looking for a review of the best way to achieve proper cod recovery and to achieve the recovery of other fish stocks . #% There are some encouraging signs that this may happen . #% There is the persecution of disabled people in some communist countries and the persecution based on tribal origin in the Sudan . #% 
The artisanal fisheries contribute over 90 % of fish consumed locally and provide 25 % of export earnings for the fisheries market . #% In 1997 it allocated under ECU 2 million to research in the disease . #% Mr President , I have noted very carefully what my Irish colleague has said . #% The Commission falls very short of this in the White Paper . #% The House can be assured that on every occasion that meetings of this type take place , these issues are raised . #% I would like to know what the Council ' s response to this is . #% There are now European-wide programmes operating in all elements of our education system . #% I support Mr Langen when he states that he is concerned to see that European farmers do not lose out as the new euro currency comes into play . #% They were applied for a reason . #% We want the General Affairs Council to do its business . #% Surplus beet is of limited value to growers and an ethanol plant would provide an alternative outlet for a significant quantity of such beet . #% Therefore , I ask you , Commissioner , what proposals will you make to the Council of Ministers and to the expert group for enhancing and strengthening Community interest in this area ? #% It is totally unacceptable to suggest reopening the Luxembourg Accord of last year . #% As a parliamentarian I have to accept that we use procedures sometimes as a way of either promoting or shielding ourselves from particular votes . #% I welcome the flexibility provided for in the derogations . #% Now is the time for the new Member States to ensure that they have real regional authorities -- not just paper tigers -- otherwise they may find that the Irish experience will be their experience tomorrow . #% Mr President , I spent last week in Turkey with members of the Human Rights Subcommittee . #% This is one of the reasons it has been successful to date . #% There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road , which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view . #% I also thank the European office dealing with human rights in Nigeria . #% If you look at the report itself , it is geared towards facilitating the common foreign and security policy . #% Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it is very appropriate that the European Union should engage in this political activity in order to make the point that we do not want to destroy but to support and maintain minority cultures and languages ? #% We must all face up to this fact and facilitate this process as much as possible . #% I understand that from the period from 1994 to 1999 , ECU 226.487 million were available to the UK to use for marketing and processing . #% Given the extent of monetary policy integration foreseen by the single currency project , it is vital that its economic policy counterparts , as they emerge , should involve all the institutions of the Union . #% I therefore urge that a firm and resolute stand be taken , with no fudging and no budging from the principle that no aid can flow from the EU to an authority run by the terrorists of Hamas . #% For me that is a massive dimension of funding which could very well be invested in the UK economy to help those people in the industry . #% It is sad they resorted to personal attacks when my report very much reflects the views of people in the regions . #% I am sure that the benefits of cooperation will encourage further cooperation and democratization . #% Given this fact , it is regrettable that he was subsequently elected as Prime Minster of Israel , this being the root of many of the current problems . #% Mr Curry had strong words for not only our Department of the Environment but also our Department of Finances policies , our Environmental Protection Agency , our Heritage Protection Agency and , indeed , our local authorities . #% Parliament has closely followed the functioning and impact of the instrument to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with these objectives . #% Recommendations are just something that they comply with if it suits them , but not if they do not . #% Second , much emphasis is being placed upon the lack of ability on the part of Europe to deliver on things like the Lisbon Agenda and creating more jobs . #% The full definition of the Prodi project properly should await the new parliamentary mandate and the nomination of the new Commission . #% Obviously , some people still feel upset that there is movement within Parliament . #% This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important , targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen . #% The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds . #% The tragic terrorist attacks in America last September highlighted the need for European Union Member States and our international partners to bolster cooperation to defeat the evils of international terrorism . #% EU governments fully recognise that the development of the European economy can not be achieved unless we take full advantage of new and evolving information technologies . #% So there it is . #% The prime objective of all legislation should be to allow the internal market to function without cross-border obstacles to the growth of industries . #% Can the Commissioner tell me what the Commission intends to do about that ? #% Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature death and illness in the whole of the European Union . #% Firstly , from the environmental viewpoint , the use of varieties which genetic alteration has made more resistant to soil-borne and air-borne diseases has drastically reduced the need for herbicides , fungicides and other chemical plant protection product which leave very damaging residues in the soil . #% This issue has come up under the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease review . #% The links between the nuclear power industry and the nuclear weapons industry for many years led to an ethos of tremendous secrecy and a refusal to admit anything could ever possibly be wrong . #% If the rapporteur 's proposals are accepted , however , I would still emphasize the need for detailed examination of the programme and monitoring of the expenditure . #% Mr President , homeopathic medicine has been officially recognised in certain Member States for many years but has been barely tolerated in others . #% Regrettably , in many parts of the world , but also in Northern Ireland , the lawyers and judges have found themselves in the front line where the trouble is most intense and the murder of Rosemary Nelson brings home to us once again the danger that many of these professionals put themselves into when defending one of their clients ' most basic human rights . #% The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases . #% In addition , it is crucial that Member States are allowed the necessary discretion and flexibility to decide for themselves their own goals and political measures , while reaching broad Community targets . #% We live in an internal market and there must be solidarity between the Member States and the European Union in the event of energy supply problems . #% I hope that by measuring the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide in these vehicles we will be able to develop possible measures to improve vehicle performance in these areas . #% I fully supported the text as adopted by the Council . #% For the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe , the academic debate should be well and truly over . #% Mr President , I also voted against this resolution . #% Would he agree that rural tourism requires additional funding under the proposed new operational programme for tourism ? #% I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid . #% Madam President , I should like to say on behalf of my group that we welcome the fact that this announcement was made first in this House and not to the media or elsewhere . #% Does the Council agree that the cultural policy in the EU must , or should reflect the feelings of the European people ? #% For many , the very expression ` genetically modified organism ' , is a concept lifted directly from science fiction . #% Europe needs flexibility to move forward and meet the challenges of globalisation . #% Not a single mention was made of the crisis being faced by the aviation industry in Europe as a result of this atrocity . #% Secondly , we have different types of employment systems in each Member State and a ` one size fits all ' approach will not necessarily work . #% To say that encryption will solve our problems is an admission of failure . #% 
The Commission is right to demand its right of association under the Treaty and , through that , for this Parliament to demand its right of accountability and scrutiny . #% We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty . #% This report highlights the need for real effective guidelines and standards for refugees . #% in writing . - This report addresses significant weaknesses in the current regulatory framework . #% It allows us , of course , to have spin-offs in a variety of sectors which have already been mentioned and which will enhance the SME sector . #% In that case , when the sensitivity of the availability of documents was clearly signalled , why was it not prioritised by the services in such a way as to avoid this ? #% The purpose of the directive is to implement the principle of equal treatment between persons , irrespective of religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation outside the labour market . #% I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place . #% I must pose the question : are we ordering our business in a correct fashion ? #% We took a general vote and there was an overwhelming desire to make a special reference to the child in the context of the family . #% I am confident that progress will be made in these areas in the forthcoming Irish presidency . #% We knew that the amendment would be defeated but nonetheless I and a number of my colleagues decided to vote for it because of our firm belief in the principle of habeas corpus and that it is a good one . #% Many of us have been involved in trying to find some way out of the planetary catastrophe that could ensue . #% No , not in any shape or form . #% I get the feeling that those concerned only with book-keeping have absolutely no understanding of what is happening out there in the real world . #% I call on the Commission to give Parliament a commitment in that regard before we cast our vote on this proposal . #% It has totally destabilized the prices and on four occasions since 1989 we have tried the minimum import price response and it has not worked . #% We almost had it , and the US pulled out at the last moment . #% From an Irish perspective we are witnessing the beginning of the end of reprocessing at Sellafield and we have allies . #% He recently stated that there would be two objectives for his new government : firstly , the application of Malta to join the European Union ; and secondly , the repairing of the public national finances in Malta . #% Mr President , at the moment I can do little more than thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities for this excellent report . #% Parliament should be forcing Indonesia to allow people in there to see what is really going on . #% I voted against both these reports . #% Mr President , firstly , I find it quite incredible that Mr Tindemans is being hailed here as a visionary . #% According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey in 2008 , this barrier is seen as a major concern by up to 60 % of retailers . #% There is a silent abhorrence of some of this research by citizens who expect us to reflect their concerns in this Parliament . #% The clear need of these countries to upgrade their industry , transport networks and environmental protection systems , will all have a major impact on the existing structural funds ' policy . #% The global statistics for the involvement of children in labour are really astonishing , particularly when you see the breakdown , where it is estimated that something like two million children globally are involved in prostitution and pornography and approximately six million children are in bonded or forced labour . #% I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market . #% It is not yet clear , for that matter , how far Member States are prepared to go in framing a common security policy . #% I strongly believe that there must be a complete ban on the feeding of swill to pigs . #% The recent cuts in quotas for several stocks in the EU last month provide ample illustration of the need to make conservation of stocks the main priority . #% Seattle failed because the United States , in particular , appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection , the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy , animal welfare , health concerns and social rights . #% Though still high at 35p per minute to make a call and 17p per minute to receive a call , they are set to fall further over the next three years . #% The Aarhus Convention demands that we the people contribute information and have access to it , that the people are part of every decision taken about the environment and that we have affordable and ready access to justice when it is necessary to protect the environment and the families in it . #% We can not stop supporting our farmers while the Americans and others continue with their export-enhancing schemes . #% I know , as the budget rapporteur for our committee , without a legal base it is very difficult . #% The imminent reform of the CFP presents an opportunity to take the policy in a new direction , away from excessive bureaucracy , and deliver on all the aspects which it should - environmentally , socially and economically . #% This will be very welcome . #% There are , of course , areas where I believe we can improve performance : better training for administrators through exchanges ; streamlining administrative processes ; strengthening the role of regions and local authorities ; combatting the irregularities in fraud by establishing clear audit trails ; better access to information . #% In welcoming the ceasefire , I offer that advice and that caution from the experience in my country . #% Our Amendment No 22 tries to correct this directive 's drafting . #% We need cogent , slimmed-down regulation , not costly duplication . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , just a little bit of respect for a rapporteur from my colleagues would be appreciated ! #% The occurrences of personal injury and damage to property are all too frequent , despite the best efforts of our various national safety councils to reduce such tragedies . #% Mr President , as you have probably gathered from the number of Irish contributors , this is a very vexed issue in my own country . #% This is an ongoing human rights issue and I agree with Mrs Larive that when looking at our relationships with many of the countries to which these children have been abducted , we must regard this as being one of the essential human rights . #% They feel that , if this Irish compromise goes through , it will be a retrograde step in relation to animal welfare . #% We have huge concerns about that . #% It seems to me that to get information on these types of initiatives you need to be a member of the Freemasons . #% The President-in-Office said that a host of instruments are available , but despite that , the EU-25 import dependency for energy , which was 48 % in 2002 , is projected to rise to 71 % by 2030 . #% But at the same time , the actions that we see after those words sometimes appear to undermine those very basic core tenets contained in the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Tackling gender stereotypes is necessary but not enough . #% I look forward to more . #% It is therefore evident that tough decisions will have to be taken if a deal is to be reached in time for the Hong Kong ministerial round next month . #% In general , the suffering of poor people in the Third World is not always eradicated by free trade -- sometimes quite the opposite . #% What about the common agricultural policy , Mr Blair ? #% But the other reason I resent the opportunist hypocrisy is this : those Members that complain about the current system are not obliged to take travel expenses . #% However , he will understand if , from my group 's perspective , I can not go along with the suggestion that we abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure . #% Finally , we also need to look at the involvement of China in all of this . #% In Ireland we have seriously restricted , and still restrict , the number of young Irish people who train for medicine , nursing , pharmacology and the therapies . #% Many actions and measures taken have brought with them great sacrifice and we must remain conscious of that . #% The choice for the nation-states is this : a choice between a Europe of cooperating sovereign nation-states , or a Europe that is itself a superstate . #% Those issues need to be factored into the WTO negotiations . #% They can hardly be perceived as providing a positive function . #% What improvements do you intend to make in terms of consultation of all the actors involved - consumers , SMEs , and the government departments that will have to implement any particular laws that emerge from this ? #% 
To have an effective influence on the world stage , we must end our paralysis in Common Foreign and Security Policy decision-making . #% But this is a short-sighted and short-term viewpoint , and we need to look at the wider implications . #% I would ask you to get a task force together of top-drawer implementers of communications to assist you in that . #% However , particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland , whose prosperity and employment levels depend to a large extent on its capacity to attract foreign investment . #% I would also extend the awareness of the dangers of mercury to include the fact that it is used as a convenient industrial preservative that needs to be replaced . #% However , the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism . #% Indeed , there are thresholds for getting elected to Parliament , never mind getting money for political parties . #% So , we must have good control but it must be targeted , it must be specific , it must be to the point , and it must be in areas where abuse has been found . #% This results in overexploitation . #% I do not , generally speaking , support the extra bans , particularly on SF6 and others . #% Last year the Court of Auditors drew attention to the fact that it is not only the institutions of the Union that are failing in the correct administration , but more importantly it is the national governments . #% I voted against Amendment 28 because it would allow the EU to backtrack on commitments of support to farmers by forcing countries to co-finance schemes such as the Single Farm Payment . #% The quote is directly from him . #% We want a more predictable base-deepening formula for determining the evolution of tax rates . #% I remember , as a schoolboy , seeing on television at home a visit by John Fitzgerald Kennedy to places I had never been in our divided continent . #% On the other hand I can not accept that countries which have strong currencies and are eligible to join the European Union , but are not willing to do so , should be given the facility of subsidizing the nominal reductions in prices which occur if their currencies appreciate against the Euro . #% As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy of the European Parliament , I support the need for Member States to establish harmonised environmental inspections . #% To the President-in-Office I would like to say that you have won respect and support from this institution for the semester . #% The revival of the Maltese application to join the European Union will ensure that it is dealt with in the context of the next round of enlargement negotiations , in accordance with commitments given by EU Heads of Government at Corfu . #% Mr President , I rise to make a point of order under Rule 127 . #% It should not be allowed to continue because this kind of bullying and harassment can be fatal and has in many instances resulted in people either taking their own lives or , through misadventure in the workplace , in others taking their lives . #% They can have an impact . #% It is going to cost us . #% Unfortunately , that way forward will not be found by trying to analyse why the voters in France and Holland said ` no ' . #% This becomes all the more important in the context of enlargement with the cultural and linguistic diversity in many of the applicant states . #% We need collectively to do much more than we are in dealing with this problem . #% We must have an end to this type of dishonesty that characterised Fianna Fáil 's approach to the question of joining Partnership for Peace . #% I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum . #% It is in this way that the Irish economy can make a positive contribution towards generating growth in the euro zone . #% I hope it represents a new dawn , a rebirth , a renaissance for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that all the political actors will now seize this moment to ground and root the peace in the institutions of that agreement . #% I am aware that concerns exist among frequent flyers and I am concerned about subjecting other passengers , such as pregnant women and children , to body scanners . #% Finally , the presidency has identified environmental policy as one of its priorities . #% She asked me to apologize for her not being able to be here . #% Quite honestly I am not too sure what I can do about it , but we will look at it and see if some improvement can take place . #% Illegal renditions by US agents have taken place . #% I would like in particular to commend my colleague , Mr McCartin , for his thorough and comprehensive work on the very important matter before us . #% Parliament 's priorities on the general framework regulation are , in fact , clear . #% Finally , it is important to support the use of alternatives to PVC products . #% Therefore , consensus may be difficult to achieve . #% If , in the struggle to defeat terrorism , we deny people civil and political rights then we are undermining our democracies . #% Health services , education services , transport and cultural services not only help to protect those who are at risk of poverty , but also keep tens if not hundreds of millions out of poverty by their very existence . #% Again we hear the Lisbon Strategy being trotted out : the mantra of Lisbon . #% We produce 1.3 billion tonnes of waste annually , some 40 million tonnes of which is hazardous . #% Therefore , the report calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments , which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy . #% The Irish presidency has proposed a compromise on this issue and the House needs to be aware that this compromise is completely unacceptable if the way Parliament voted is taken into account . #% This funding could then be doubled through co-financing instruments up to $ 50m . #% I am also concerned that to some extent the approach lacks scientific rigour in this area . #% The experience of agricultural trade liberalisation in Mexico should serve as a warning against the promotion of fully open markets as a solution for the needs of developing countries . #% I am sure the Commissioner will do the same . #% While I can fully appreciate and have great sympathy with the concerns of colleagues calling for burden-sharing , there is a fairly large amount of informal burden-sharing going on anyway . #% We were constantly told they were not part of the competence of the Treaties and our concerns for their welfare were beyond the reach of this Parliament . #% No one should be favoured or the whole basis of such a tax would be undermined . #% It must use its legitimate power to protect Amina Lawal and other Nigerian women in similar situations from this cruel , degrading and inhumane treatment under Sharia law . #% I believe we need to spell out clearly our present security and defence policy to the people of Ireland . #% I would also like to thank the Commission for acceding to my plea for a special protocol for non-susceptible animals , in particular equidae . #% If the Danish proposals were to be implemented , those who put unsafe vessels on our seas would think twice . #% In the light of the present crisis we also welcome the fact that the strategy paper developed last year examined the possibility of making a single member of the Commission responsible for all matters relating to migration policy . #% The rapporteur believes that only a directive can force the Member States to introduce these inspection systems . #% These programmes - Daphne , STOP and Grotius - came into existence following the tragedy of the Dutroux murders in Belgium . #% For the hundreds and thousands of haemophiliacs and all those patients with the whole range of immunodeficiency diseases , these are life threatening issues which they are faced with on a daily basis . #% Tackling climate change was never labelled as being easy , but complacency in dealing with it is far worse . #% Do as I say , not as I do , seems to be official EU policy . #% I know tax is a national competence , but we are moving towards harmonisation of tax and I would therefore humbly request that the Commissioner approach the Irish authorities to seek a reduction in the vehicle registration tax , so that Irish citizens can enjoy the same benefit as their continental counterparts . #% The Jackson report sends out a clear signal that the European Parliament supports the principles of a recycling society - Member States should do so too . #% Elected Members must exercise greater care and concern when drawing up development policies that will ultimately affect Union citizens . #% I will be urging Members to vote against the Council 's common position and I hope that we succeed in getting the required number of votes . #% 
Surely , free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy . #% Secondly , I want to stress the need to be careful not to damage our European institutions by blowing up into a major scandal matters which are important in relation to Eurostat but which , bearing in mind the prospective elections , might do untold damage to our institutions if pursued too strongly . #% The objective of the Single European Sky proposal is to ensure that air traffic management systems are designed , managed and regulated in a harmonised way within the Union and with the highest possible level of safety . #% However , we must not allow our opposition to violence to cloud our respect and protection of human rights . #% The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age . #% While I am very pleased to hear about these intensive negotiations , I would also like to make the comment that , according to recent scientific journals , there is no question of compensation being paid . #% The original wording could have led to the spinning off of subsidiaries and the breaking up of companies by stealth . #% There are many proposals among the numerous amendments which remain highly contentious , including references to minimum capital , checks on registration , references to national law , cross-border components and employee participation . #% We are only setting up a new military bloc , which I do not believe is a good idea . #% First and most importantly of all , you mentioned the massacre at Beslan and in particular the slaughter of innocents that took place . #% We can not experiment on human beings at any stage of their development and we certainly can not mass-produce embryos for experimentation . #% It was established by rules and protocols agreed by the Member State governments , acting on the authority of the people who elected them , to ensure that they could bring forward ideas and proposals on their behalf . #% Affirmative action is still necessary - until real equality exists , not just where great talent is present , but also for those who are less forceful . #% It is not just in the UK - the epicentre of the outbreak - but even in the Cooley Peninsula in Ireland , which had to be depopulated that to this day the psychological damage to the families concerned is absolutely immense . #% I could advise Members of this House , and perhaps Member State governments whose observers are here today , to look at the Irish model , where we have committed ourselves between now and 2025 to putting 1 % of our GDP towards a future pensions fund . #% In the light of concerns expressed in the past about air quality within the institutions , I propose to email to colleagues this article which once and for all scotches any feeling that smoking within an enclosed area is anything but harmful . #% He said that he had made a certain amount of progress in freeing a certain number of commercial vehicles in particular from Spain and Britain . #% I merely wish to say on this point of order that the Irish people took a democratic decision that we all accept . #% The general public should be acquainted with the wide range of potential benefits from the single currency , such as the prospect of lower mortgage interest rates , no further risk from currency fluctuations , particularly for small and medium-sized businesses exporting their products from one Member State to another , reduced costs for trade and reduced costs for travel . #% I believe that the proposed opening of on additional facility for raw materials that have access to inward processing arrangements will not be sufficient to cover the food industry supply and export requirements . #% We have achieved several important changes to the draft proposal , which will bring greater protection for human health and the environment , especially in the area where the maximum threshold for the amount of PFOS that can be placed on the market as a substance or preparation has been substantially reduced from the Commission 's original proposal . #% Let us hasten slowly and be sure we have replacements , rather than moving at a pace which will drive people into veterinary medicines , away from their current practices . #% First of all , a British colleague has criticised the situation with regard to the importance of democracy and human rights . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply . #% We just need an assurance that the Chair will respect people wanting to raise a point of order . #% The speech demonstrated that the political elites ' claim to be listening to the people of Europe is as phoney as the latest suggestion of a cosmetic stunt of dropping the title ` Constitution ' . #% A milestone was reached by the 1995 Beijing Conference in advancing the gender equality agenda . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for a very good job of work . #% Under the better regulation announcement by President Barroso some weeks ago , the F-gases were mentioned in terms of impact assessment and analysis . #% The closest we can get to that are governments . #% The implementation of such a treaty is long overdue . #% I hope I will be back . #% The integrity of the legislation we adopt in this House continually and increasingly depends on scientific rigour , and I have increasing concerns about that . #% I am proud of our record in securing inward investment . #% What is clear , particularly in my own country at the moment , is that we must challenge the alarming rise in racism and xenophobia within our communities . #% Now that education system has been completely decimated . #% Competition can actually have a harmonising effect . #% in writing . - Today the European Parliament endorsed a $ 14 million fund which is to go towards the training of 1 900 Dell workers who were made redundant by the decision to move the plant from Ireland to Poland . #% If anybody imagines that our drug policies are working , then they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land . #% Let us move away from the lies , the fear and scaremongering that takes place . #% Indeed , the only possible explanation is its politicians paying undue attention to the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies who paid for their election . #% Because of the relative resilience of trees to survive , the necessary silvacultural practices could be neglected in the early years of establishment of new forests . #% From that point of view it is expensive for those people . #% This needs to be done in relation to disabled people themselves . #% My own personal experience with Internet shopping has not inspired me with e-confidence . #% There is important work to be done and I am hopeful that , despite the concerns that many of us have with regard to your exercise of power in Italy , the European agenda will be advanced . #% We need to demonstrate that the Sharon extremism will not bring security to the Israeli State , nor will Palestinian suicide bombers bring a Palestinian State into existence . #% What we know from the comparative success in Mazar-i-Sharif and now in Kabul , and even reports of the front line extending to Kandahar , is that new challenges are presenting themselves . #% Could I urge the Council , and the President-in-Office in particular , to give support to the Indonesian Foreign Minister in ensuring the release of all political prisoners , in particular Aung San Suu Kyi ? #% The European Union is in a strong position to promote cooperation on asylum and immigration and to promote judicial and police cooperation . #% There is of course a cost factor in environmental management , but equally an economic return , which not easily quantified but exists none the less . #% I can , however , confirm that the United Kingdom is one of the fourteen Member States to have ratified the 1957 European Convention and it is a signatory to the recently adopted EU convention relating to extradition . #% Of course , they have a high priority , but they are not the whole story and we must focus on the whole story . #% On a recent visit to Iran I learnt that almost 5 000 Iranian soldiers have been killed by Afghan drug smugglers . #% One of the great problems in all the European institutions is that we have developed a language , a glossary of terminology that has created a barrier between ourselves and the people of Europe we represent . #% We must strive to ensure that the structural funds continue to play an important part in achieving the economic and social cohesion which the Treaty underlines . #% It is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country . #% Let me make it clear that I have always believed that the future for this Union is in the cooperation of sovereign nation states and not in the incorporation of nation states into a single international superstate . #% Increasingly , rather than screaming at the institutions of Union to solve the problems , farmers will have to come together and try to calculate what the needs of the market are and produce for those needs . #% I can not read all of them ; and if there is to be transparency on these issues they need to be available publicly on the web and in languages that people can understand . #% In principle any wild animal can be used to provide a market with bushmeat . #% However , the British Government has recently published a draft inquiries bill . #% They have a battle to win the hearts and minds of their people in relation to joining Europe , just as we have in Ireland at this particular time in relation to the ratification of the Nice Treaty . #% As soon as it receives the European Parliament 's opinion the Council will , of course , act swiftly on that proposal . #% However there are aspects of the war and not just the terrorist aspect which have been kept hidden and one group I should like to mention - to which , Madam President , you paid tribute on Monday - is the journalists who paid the ultimate price to tell us the story . #% Another question for you , Commissioner : are you stating that the Memorandum of Understanding was entirely the responsibility of the Irish Government and that the Commission acquiesced or agreed ? #% 
With pig farmers contemplating suicide , and some committing suicide as a result of the problems , the situation is desperate . #% The best way to eradicate terrorism is to restore democracy , rather than turning a blind eye to a military regime that is abusing democracy , wants to retain power and does not want to return it to a civilian administration . #% Recycling saves on energy , raw materials , waste-disposal costs , import bills and the need for landfill sites . #% We are not going to build a Community and send in regulations to the new countries in Eastern Europe . #% Because we are debating this issue today , certainly , as far as I am concerned , I have no intention of withdrawing my friendship from the United States and I hope nobody else has . #% Specifically , my group , has for many months now raised the question of individual responsibility . #% This would create a connection between Europe and the people of Europe . #% There is clear evidence in various regions of the globe that pressure from governments , international organisations and NGOs is starting to have an effect on attitudes towards trafficking . #% Modern households living in confined spaces do not have room for holding or stockpiling waste for long periods . #% Part of the purpose of this dialogue is for us to seek rational solutions if people perceive disadvantages in what we propose . #% In conclusion , I wish the Greek Presidency every success and would like to say , on behalf of my political group , that we will be more than willing to cooperate with them fully in the interests of the European Union as a whole . #% One particular difficulty highlighted by various Community seafarers was the question of the lack of language understanding and fluency in communicating with third country seafarers . #% Take the recent decision by Sweden , seeking to bring in more conservation measures in relation to cod : they were prevented from doing that . #% - I believe that this is a good report and deserves support . #% I believe that true women-oriented development would support women with safe gynaecological and obstetrical care , maternal care and childcare . #% Having read the report and the amendments I am still not fully convinced that the distinction is clear enough between the standby duties and the waiting time . #% It is extremely serious because we could have another Chernobyl . #% The price for EU agriculture and for EU consumers in terms of food supply is enormous -- you have outlined it to us here this morning : downsizing by USD 20 billion a year . #% One does not get the impression that this issue has been pursued vigorously enough by the Commission as a whole nor , indeed , by Member States . #% Sometimes we in Parliament feel that we are presented with a fait accompli agreed by the social partners , and that this is political blackmail - we can not oppose it because the social partners have agreed it . #% After decades of IRA - and other terrorism in Northern Ireland , we have hundreds of unsolved murders , many of whose perpetrators have fled the jurisdiction . #% That has been the assurance given by David Cameron , and unlike his cast-iron guarantee of before , he must hold to this promise . #% I think that this will help not only larger companies , but smaller ones too . #% It operates in conjunction with the cod recovery plan in the Irish Sea . #% I believe we must have a cohesive approach to these international war crimes and there must be no hiding place for those who commit them . #% Instead , we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect . #% The action taken was scientifically based and I believe we are close to bringing this public health scare to a successful - and with strict adherence to production controls to a permanent - conclusion . #% Finally , the behaviour of the British Government with regard to the beef crisis is unacceptable . #% I am in favour of the Turkish Republic joining the European Union , but this kind of activity will undermine its efforts to do so . #% But a lot of attitudes have changed radically in the last few years , particularly on issues of animal welfare . #% The momentum towards EU enlargement is bringing real challenges to the EU institutions in terms of implementing the internal changes as laid down in the Treaty of Nice . #% Full broadband facilities must be available to all rural , as well as urban , areas and especially to the most peripheral areas of the European Union . #% It is very important that all citizens have equal access to state-of-the-art drugs , regardless of where they live in Europe . #% This experience raises a fundamental dilemma for the EU : would its military and police operations be exclusively peacekeeping or should it have a peace-enforcing capability ? #% My group , the Green/EFA Group , signed the amendment , but we were appalled that the amendment and the resolution does not go far enough . #% For electricity production the introduction of a Community-wide law on inputs to the grid is a most important step . #% Global stocks are no longer the key figure ; we need to know where the stocks are and to realise that they will not come out of China or India . #% Unfortunately , it is too late for many of the victims , but just think of the future victims whose lives have been saved because of the decision taken today . #% Landfilling is a ticking time-bomb due to the release of hazardous PVC additives and the potential for dioxin formation during landfill fires . #% I firmly believe that the granting of financial support for the teaching and learning of Irish and also Luxembourgish sends out the right signals that Parliament clearly and positively supports minority languages . #% Here , surely , lies one of the most serious challenges facing the continuity of European agriculture . #% Buyer beware ! #% The granting of a derogation to the geographically-separated rail networks of Ireland , Northern Ireland and Greece does not in any way undermine this principle . #% Currently each EU citizen is making on average 138 non-cash payments per year and this is likely to grow . #% Thus , it is so much nonsense to now talk grandly about securing equality of treatment between territories . #% I would ask the Commission what assurances it can give that this is not happening . #% But I would appeal to Member States to work closely with the Commission in helping to focus and target these actions to get better results . #% Serious human rights issues are at stake . #% We have lost a true friend . #% This is the new directive , of course , and I am pleased that it has been extended to offshore workers , fishermen and doctors in training . #% It was perpetrated by up to 12 killers , a significant number of whom are known members of the provisional IRA . #% This is a truly unacceptable state of affairs . #% Solving the problem of unemployment requires active labour market measures . #% This is probably the most lobbied report we have ever had in this Parliament . #% Strong and positive leadership is required to bring the Middle East peace process back to the top of the international political agenda . #% In previous debates I referred to the need to reduce waste : here the manufacturers of food and consumer goods have an important role to play , particularly in relation to packaging in its various forms and the importance of using products compatible with recycling , which is of course my preferred option . #% I hope that this is one of the core issues which will be addressed by the new Convention which has now been set up by the EU leaders . #% I entirely regret this result , but one must live as a democrat with due process . #% It is no good for the Commissioner to say that we have the Charter of Fundamental Rights : That is only a non-legally binding political decision . #% Mr President , As someone who has spent many years serving on a local and regional authority in Ireland , I broadly welcome this report and I wish to thank Mr Napolitano for his work . #% There is some feeling within the Socialist Group that the proposal is somewhat lacking in ambition . #% I just wish to ask the Commissioner : if a child is abducted by a non-parental person , surely that is a criminal offence and should be dealt with by Europol ? #% Mr President , we are absolutely obliged to take steps to propose to Parliament that a clear and effective mechanism be set up to monitor greenhouse gas emissions . #% This decision is particularly important for Dublin . #% Ireland has benefited greatly from EU funding to develop its rail and road infrastructure . #% Bearing in mind the President-in-Office 's comments about the exclusive right of Member States , would he not also accept that the policy of the European Union is support for the concept of one country , two systems ? #% 
You have a disability bill to introduce , a health and education system to sort out , fishermen and women , farmers and many small businesses in great difficulties , and numerous environmental crises . #% In view of the sensitivities of this , the Greens have proposed three important points . #% There will always be disagreements between us and the United States . #% Their function , as I understand it , is to disseminate information and defend the interests of this institution in a non-partisan manner in the country in which they are located . #% At the end of the day the Council of Ministers considered that this was the fairest allocation . #% Mr President , I voted against the decision on combating terrorism because I feel it is fundamentally flawed . #% As an indication of the seriousness of the situation the Commission recommended cuts of greater than 10 % for a quarter of them -- that was 49 stocks . #% Mr President , the over-commercialisation of sport has clearly led to the exploitation of many young athletes . #% For that reason , I hope that other Groups will support my proposal tomorrow on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to postpone the vote on a resolution until the next Strasbourg session in June . #% These situations can no longer be allowed in a world where we should be fully aware of the environmental problems that we are causing . #% The Commission proposed Agenda 2000 one and a half years ago . #% I want to speak on one point only , and that is the necessity to work with all our might to obtain for the European Union a Treaty on renewable energy , an equivalent to the Treaty on Nuclear Power , the EURATOM Treaty , which we discussed earlier this morning . #% I believe the Commissioner is wrong about force-feeding itself not causing unnecessary suffering or injury and not being in breach of the directive on farm animals , as Mrs Lucas mentioned . #% If we can not protect women and children from being intimidated from their homes and if people are forced to flee , then the evils of lawlessness and terror will be loosed again for another generation . #% CITES regulates trade in some 30 000 species of plants and animals . #% We congratulate you on a job very well done . #% Every country can point to a major species where a drug has been taken off the market , not because it is not available somewhere in Europe , but because there has not been a marketing authorisation for that particular Member State . #% Fianna Fail ' s Group requested a roll-call vote on the final paragraph of the resolution , which refers to codecision for the CAP . #% Some children , however , are criminally abducted and are never found . #% On that particular point , would a proposal with regard to the worldwide marketing of the European Union as a tourist destination be considered - not necessarily funded or put in place , but just considered ? #% Also , in case Members do not know it , under a strict legal interpretation any EU legislation supersedes any constitutional provision or any other national legislative provision in any one of the Member States . #% The Commission is proposing to extend it to 2010 . #% Please rest assured that the matter raised by the honourable Member is very much in the minds of the Council and is being raised at every opportunity . #% We simply do not agree on how best to do that . #% On the issues which the President-designate has raised of reform , which should be brought forward by Commissioner Kinnock next February with due consultation , the policy programme of next January , the moral and political imperative of addressing the enlargement challenge and preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference , I pledge my group to a positive and constructive engagement with the Commission in this regard . #% This is something that we all pay a great deal of lip service to but we are in practice regressing , we are going backwards on energy-saving . #% I should like to thank Mr Sturdy , Mr Parish and my UK colleagues who were at the forefront in promoting the original establishment of the temporary committee , for reasons that will be obvious . #% I have represented constituents in other Member States in the European Union where they have been held without trial for two years , without getting any opportunity for habeas corpus or any opportunity to present their case . #% We are all too familiar with Ministers appearing at General Affairs Council meetings , taking the television cameras on the way in with their one or two one-liners and then going on their way . #% This proposal urges Member States to set up new centres and training courses to maximise the potential of scientific resources on rare diseases and pool together existing research centres and disease information networks . #% Unlike the common agricultural policy it does not have the confidence or respect either of the producers or the consumers . #% Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream . #% The enlargement of the European Union to include all the applicant countries is an ambition that will be achieved over a period of years . #% Furthermore , he has fed the hatreds that have resulted in the escalation of anti-Semitic activity which I deplore . #% As you have heard earlier , in Ireland we have the situation where Ryanair baggage handlers are on strike simply because they want to be represented by a trade union . #% A very significant percentage of the catch goes to the processing industry , meaning that there are very many dependent jobs both at sea and on shore . #% That is the only question that needs to be answered because we are too late now . #% We are not sure whether we can be guaranteed that the routes will not change , but irrespective of that we have to look at our commitment , and the UK has to look at its commitment , to EU legislation -- in particular the waste shipment regulation . #% Yet again the PPE have demonstrated their inability to sustain any support for the shambolic approach to Council resolutions and , in particular , Agenda 2000 . #% Finally , on the overall package on combating terrorism , we have to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms . #% The events of the last few weeks have rocked the European Union to its foundation . #% I hope that this Community will take note of what I have said . #% So it is a very good day for all of us that we are today debating Mrs Waddington 's excellent and very comprehensive report . #% It will take a number of years before we know what is actually happening . #% I think , quite frankly , that Mr Mobutu should be arrested for genocide and war crimes against his own people . #% They recognise that it has given us security of food supply . #% For the ELDR this is a Union both wider and deeper with a political and social as well as an economic mission , but also with the institutional capability to see it through . #% Yes , you will possibly achieve your goal , but at what cost to this most important industry ? #% As with the debate on the fluorinated gases regulation , although this is a less clear cut example , I have concerns about the lack of certainty we are introducing into our legislation through dual legal bases following ECJ judgments in this area . #% The local production of photovoltaic energy on buildings makes renewable energy very competitive . #% In conclusion , we should also be encouraging the production of safer medical alternatives and encouraging their markets as they become available . #% James Tobin was one of the first to promote the idea as a means of stabilising global financial markets and , in the process , raising substantial money for development aid . #% The long-term benefits far outweigh these costs and will lead to a considerable reduction , if not total elimination , of the use of landfill as a waste disposal solution . #% I believe that fishermen must be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence . #% After the collapse of the talks in Cancún , there were some worrying signs that the United States was going to abandon the multilateral rules and force a series of bilateral deals around the globe . #% Comparisons of farm income can be very difficult : they depend on the base year used -- 1995 in this case -- and the figures vary depending on whether you take an aggregate , a family , a household or an individual measure . #% When we expand the European Union , or even without expansion , we will not retain all the provisions of the present policy . #% It had a population of 60 000 and 15 000 daily commuters . #% The Ecstasy problem is now escalating out of control and party packs are now widely available in Dublin . #% I deplore the inability of Member States to treat seriously the question of energy in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Yet , despite this , EFSA has reaffirmed their risk assessment on this and said that it is safe for European farm animals . #% Mr President , if an Irishwoman may intrude on this debate and pour oil on troubled waters , I will confine myself to European topics . #% The Environment Committee adopted two contradictory amendments , one for a total exemption and one tightening up the common position line of a conditional exemption with all the normal environmental risk provisions . #% If I were to hope for anything from the Employment Summit it would be for the Commissioner to come forward with three suggestions . #% No doubt as soon as the war begins , other European leaders along with Tony Blair , will bend to the will of the United States , ignoring the views of the people , which says a lot about our democracy . #% We need to give consideration to all innovative options for waste minimisation so as to put in train the medium to long-term process of eliminating the use of landfill sites in the future . #% 
To its credit , Parliament is now proposing to accord yet again the highest priority to Northern Ireland from within its own reserves and margin for manoeuvre to make good the deficiency of ECU 100m left by the Council . #% Remember that people are intimidated on both sides within their own communities : Protestants are intimidated by Protestants , Catholics are intimidated by Catholics . #% Cooperation in the field of education has been a proven success within the European Union in recent years . #% Indeed in the US , it is my understanding that many GM crops have been shown not to increase yield but even to possibly decrease yield . #% It is a fundamental rights issue . #% You certainly moved the European agenda forward . #% Of course there is a difference . #% I wonder , taking into consideration what the President-in-office has stated in relation to initiatives that have been taken , whether or not pressure can be put on the multilateral lenders to reschedule debts to assist those countries . #% I would argue as well that social protection has to be seen as broader than simply social security . #% I can see no good in this situation . #% This is a European problem on the borders of the European Union and , if the integrity of the European Union is to remain intact , it must be resolved by the Member States of the Union . #% In relation to the particular case it is sub judice so I do not wish to say more than the comments I have already made . #% Enlargement of the European Union will itself not succeed unless the internal decision-making procedures within the Union are streamlined and simplified . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% They are important . #% The conclusion of the Agenda 2000 discussion has ensured that the European Union can move forward and discuss and implement new policy objectives and goals . #% The EU has a responsibility to ensure that these prisoners do not suffer further torture . #% Mr President , I am delighted that we are having the opportunity tonight , even at this very late hour , to discuss cohesion policy . #% We must , therefore , ensure that further reform of the LFA system is adequately financed within the overall budget for CAP and that the system used for classification is fair and non-discriminatory . #% At the meeting on 8 July , finance ministers agreed to the setting up of a high-level group , as the Members of the House will be aware , to examine this issue . #% In Ireland , thankfully , we do not have forest fires or droughts ; we have lots of rain -- sometimes too much -- but no major floods . #% So I ask that this point be given active consideration as part of the approach to dealing with this problem . #% No one can judge what will be in this report , but the military build-up of American and British troops in the Middle East is certainly an ominous sign that conflict in Iraq is a very real possibility . #% The Council has even declined to discuss the matter on an informal basis with the Committee on Transport and Tourism . #% What is clear is that the law in all our countries has not kept up with the increasingly horrific crimes against children and the sophistication and evil of those who prey on children . #% I come from Ireland , a country from which not so long ago we were exporting nurses because there were no jobs for them . #% This withdrawal must take place in the context of the Quartet 's roadmap agreement . #% While I compliment you on your good intentions , the European project will not progress if hard decisions are avoided . #% . Recently a TV crew from Romania asked me , was I seriously suggesting that the condition of children ' s institutions in Romania could jeopardise their application for membership of the EU . #% Let us have the high-tech jobs , let us even bring the software development company to the rural area , but let us have cows , sugar beet , and furrows of maize and orchards of apples in the fields around it . #% They do not want to see their local post offices closed because the market offers insufficient profit for the private postal companies which will swamp the market , driving public operators like An Post to the wall . #% I think I was getting Swedish at one point and I could not hear Mr Blak at all . #% Those who do not register shall be refused a long-term access pass to the European Parliament . #% We share the goals that the Tánaiste has outlined , his vision and commitment , and we will work with you , Mr Spring , so we can progress towards an EU which is based on equity , tolerance , justice and peace and which is open and accessible to all citizens . #% If I understood correctly , Mr Verheugen , you urged us to complete this procedure of nominating and putting in place the new Commission by the end of July . #% in writing . - I support today 's WEEE report , but we must ensure that we do not place overly-burdensome regulations on already struggling SMEs and retailers . #% The will of the United States to isolate such states in the defence of democracy is not well-served by the undemocratic arrogation unto themselves of a presumption to act and to choose for all . #% The ones who would suffer most would be the small boat owners , those with a small economic base and very little political clout but who , in fact , actually provide the most employment . #% If we are to truly address the poverty which remains but often goes unremarked in the EU , an effective system by which less-inclined areas of society start to become truly represented at third level must be achieved . #% Scientific rigour is at the core of this regulation . #% Perhaps it does not translate well into all languages , but in English it is an excellent sound bite . #% Quite frankly , the biggest threat to our hundreds of thousands of patients in the EU who need blood and blood products is the lack of an adequate supply . #% To take three questions together and only get through ten questions is really a reflection on this House . #% The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of economic development , to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency , promote the sustainable use of water land and energy as well as try and ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and environmental degradation is broken . #% Notwithstanding the generosity of the common agricultural policy , and as a result of a combination of falling prices , lower production levels and higher costs , aggravated by exceptionally bad weather , they face ongoing and serious declines in income and uncertain futures . #% Mr President , first of all , I should like to welcome the statement from Barcelona with regard to the Middle East and I trust that the intentions and ideas put forward there will be followed up by intensive diplomatic activity on the part of the European Union . #% A continuation of the free trade doctrine in the interest of European big business and the rich elites mean more of the same and therefore needs to be rejected . #% This House is the chamber of deputies of the people of Europe and is a testament to the ability to reconcile difference and to found a lasting peace . #% The uncertain future of the sugar sector has , in my opinion , seriously contributed to this closure . #% Nowadays when we look around the world we can see how it is more common and easier for industry and business to relocate outside areas with high social costs and high taxation . #% I think a paper trail is great and the EU is very good on that . #% On page 22 , Mr Cassidy pointed out that the members of this group would not be voting in the final vote . #% The benefits have been far greater than anyone could have foreseen . #% Development aid can play a pivotal role in working towards solutions , but only if it is free of trade commitments . #% I know Robin Cook is a moral man and is sincere in his condemnation of the slaughter and ethnic cleansing in that country . #% Mr President , first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt , Mrs Van Lancker and their shadows in the other groups for the excellent work they have done in seeking to strengthen the services directive . #% For example , as regards shipbuilding for the fishing sector , we have an over-capacity of fishing vessels within the European Union , so what kind of vessels should be built ? #% In this debate today , we must likewise remain calm and not give in to the narrow jingoism that some people encourage , but rather focus on creating a better European Union , that European Union which is made up of a Europe of nation states , where those nation states with their own democratically-elected governments determine and decide what they will cooperate in , what they will do and whether they will have laws , directives , framework agreements or merely bilateral agreements . #% Now the focus is on Lebanon and Syria . #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur for her work on the report and for the fact that she has rewritten the report to take account of so many amendments that were submitted including amendments from myself . #% I think this is worthwhile . #% As everybody in this House knows , and as I am sure you know , the parameters of 1999 have now been thrown out as a result of the proposals made by Commissioner Fischler regarding reform of the CAP . #% In relation to the energy tax issue , it is time we decided exactly what we mean by this . #% We , that is 50 % of us , do not have the right to walk the streets in safety . #% We would like to see our amendment supported tomorrow during the vote . #% The Community ' s Fifth Environment Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution . #% 
There may well be an initial demand on the EU budget but such costs will be minimal when compared to the huge peace dividend that will accrue from an enlarged and fully integrated Europe . #% It could in fact stir up ill-feeling , resentment and a great deal of trouble quite unnecessarily . #% The increased interdependence between the Member States and EMU demands the strengthening of economic co-ordination . #% The establishment of civil society watchdogs in developing countries must be seriously looked at and I call on the Commission to give the appropriate percentage of budget aid for such watchdogs . #% It is important that Turkey should be included , based on the principles clarified at Helsinki . #% This has not proved possible with the old programme and the Commission 's administrative services are not the people to blame . #% The extreme example is the Irish Sea , with TACs set on average 28 % above scientific advice over the past ten years . #% I have always believed that Turkey could be a very important bridge-head between the current Members of the EU and the Islamic world . #% I urge the Commission to investigate insurance rates for under-25s in Ireland to ensure that no abuse of the market exists . #% Trade liberalisation , combined with a progressive reduction in EU farm support - particularly when this reduction is to apply to those already on the margins - raises serious doubts as to our real intentions . #% How can you get redress if you do not know where to go or ask ? #% Solidarity , if it is to enjoy mass support , must be a two-way , and not a one-way process . #% In all of that it was a genuine attempt to recognise that the Rothley report simpliciter of last December clearly will not win unanimous approval of the Council ; that the Council 's text of last week clearly will not win the support of this House . #% A small matter , but please resolve it . #% As for the mental health sector , where some of the worst conditions can be found , there are no substantive plans for reform and this area has been largely ignored by the European Union . #% However , when Mr Metten , by the back door - and that is what this is - recycles a balance of payment facility into some kind of a stability pact accelerator/decelerator model to deal with cycles in the economy , I have a problem . #% I agree that we need to build our relations with China , both economic and political , but the political side should not be left out . #% We all know that the Saharoui people are supposed to vote in a referendum very soon on self-determination but of course many serious problems have been posed by the Moroccans . #% It is clear from statements of the US trade representative , Bob Zoellick , that America intends to forge ahead on a bilateral path . #% This is why we need to have that flexibility and we do not believe they should be , in fact , in the same map , even with the measure of flexibility that the Commission has proposed . #% Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur , because in her report she has come up with a solution to a problem which the Commission has made for itself . #% It was the US that provided resources and support to these unsavoury individuals when they were their allies . #% We have just spoken about the Second World War . #% Having to compete with a 12.5 % corporation tax south of the border in Ireland , the capacity for Northern Ireland to give aid to attract foreign investment is absolutely indispensable . #% It seems to me that we need commitments from the Commission that we are going to have an independent European inspectorate . #% Substantial debate and the revision of the EU 's financial perspectives for the post-1999 period are vitally important and the budgetary resources must be dramatically increased . #% This is not an acceptable level of safety in an industry where safety failures can have catastrophic outcomes . #% Mr President , I believe that all of us are in agreement that the development of renewable energy sources is the way forward . #% I wish you very good luck , Commissioner . #% This is a recommendation which I have supported as a member of the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection Committee . #% I completely support his position on it . #% Indeed , I would ask what level of Euratom safeguard efforts , personalities , site visits etc. has been deployed on that site since 1996 since when , we are told , reprocessing in the UK has been performed under Euratom safeguards ? #% Overall , progress has been made since the handover and that progress can be described as satisfactory . #% For that I thank my friend and colleague Mr Baggioni . #% The regime is right to be afraid . #% It is fascinating to all humans and it could be the key to the survival of our planet . #% This is just a completely dishonest expression of the reality . #% The amendments to this directive , which were voted and passed by the Environment Committee , will have a major impact on public health . #% We have been criticised on some parts of our resolution which make it look as though we favour the easy way , in other words bribing other people to take the measures . #% Therefore , we should ensure that the targets set at the Barcelona European Council of providing childcare to at least 90 % of children between the age of three and the mandatory school age , and to at least 33 % of children under the age of three , are met . #% Madam President , I appreciate the tactics , but would it not be more democratic if you waited until everybody came in , sat down and took part in this vote ? #% It is particularly regrettable that liberalization has gone hand-in-hand with a negative impact on energy saving . #% I support a full and open debate prior to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference , but not in the form of a convention . #% Furthermore , I believe we must ensure that the crew manning these vessels are highly trained and able to brief passengers on safety procedures in more than one language so that unnecessary loss of life is prevented . #% I know the Commissioner will take this forward and I ask him to do so with the incoming Irish presidency and future presidencies so that the Walter report does not lie in the filing drawer covered in cobwebs and dust . #% Let us build on their past success . #% This is probably the most important issue that faces the EU this year as it prepares the multi-annual guidance programme - the fourth one - to reduce the size of the fleets . #% Why did you not tell it before the vote in December ? #% These are the hypocrites , the so-called moral police forces of the world who put profit before people . #% When we speak about Kosovo , we often tend to think about it in the abstract , whereas it is the last linchpin of the very fracturous European region of the Western Balkans . #% Let me be clear that we do not question the importance of non-ODA cooperation with developing countries , in particular , the emerging markets and strategic middle-income countries , but this form of cooperation should be channelled through separate instruments to enhance transparency and protect the specific nature of development cooperation . #% I think perhaps we forget how serious the situation was . #% However , the illegal trade in the meat of wild animals is not limited to Africa . #% It did not choose to do so . #% Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never . #% It gives a British Government minister the power to determine whether an inquiry sits in private and what material is withheld . #% - Before the vote on paragraph 150 : #% I am particularly pleased to see that the chapter dealing with energy has now commenced . #% The key issue here is the self-handling at EU ports . #% Before Ryanair started to fly to Charleroi Airport it was a deserted field and now Ryanair flies 2 million people in and out , to the satisfaction of consumers using this invaluable air link . #% The only slight criticism I would have of some of the statistics in the report is that they are out of date . #% What clearly is at stake is the successful launch of the currency . #% Commissioner , please ensure that , if there is an avian flu jab , it will be mercury-free . #% However , this is not an issue to be ignored , and employers have a real responsibility -- primarily , I believe , by means of awareness raising -- as regards practical preventative measures , whereby employees who work outdoors can make informed choices about their exposure to sunlight and the need to take practical precautions to protect themselves . #% As a point of departure , I recall that it was the European Parliament , first of all the European institutions , that insisted that the Union should show its solidarity with and support for the peace process . #% In fact , the committee 's position on CMR substances has been strengthened in line with the latest position of the Scientific Committee . #% 
I do not want to see that put on direct income tax or any direct taxes . #% I strongly urge the Bhutanese authorities to accept the compromise so that field verification can begin immediately . #% It is a tragedy that this Parliament is meeting today in the shadow of the fact that our Committee on Budgets is cutting down on aid . #% However , personally , I would prefer to live independently in my community with the level of social and medical assistance that I need . #% It is not in the interests of European citizens or in the interests of the European Union as whole . #% If the effect was to jolt European leaders into the same reality stream that many of their people already occupy , then a workable Europe could emerge . #% There is a tendency when we speak about disability to provide certain services for people with disabilities , but to segregate them . #% They are exactly the same as the Irish who were desperate to get out of Ireland at one stage going to America and other places - where they were well treated . #% The foremost achievement of the European project to date has been to put an end to the rivalry and antagonism of the last century that pushed this continent into two world wars , which cost 56 million lives . #% We need to do a lot more work on that . #% The Commission laid out seven priorities to which we have added injury and safety in the workplace , and we have also stressed domestic violence among women and children . #% And I certainly could not justify increasing the entertainment budget of this place either . #% The European Union must remain at the forefront in ensuring that the American Government comes to an agreement which will guarantee the distribution of drugs which , in developing countries , could tackle , head on , diseases such as AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis . #% I would like to have talked about the financing of the larger European Union , in particular , and other issues which were raised by the President-in-Office , but in my brief time and as I represent the entire border area of the Irish Republic , I want to refer briefly to the statement on Northern Ireland by the President-in-Office . #% Every day over 3 000 children in Africa die of malaria . #% Without that we fear tensions could arise between the political and the monetary authorities , especially if the pace of economic progress slows down . #% We should be looking for a Europe that is not divided into first and the second-class tiers . #% We have pussyfooted on that issue for far too long . #% As has been pointed out here , most EU funding is actually administered by national governments and there is considerable evidence of fraud and malpractice in this area . #% As we all know , economic uncertainties and global political risks confront us and make alterations difficult . #% I wish to support the report by Mr Adam on the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and I agree with him that the Memorandum of Understanding between the G7 , the Commission and the Ukraine Government should be implemented as quickly as possible . #% Within the Union , there must be formal adoption of the EU directive on money laundering . #% Two , the traditional medicine of the non-European world which was overwhelmed by the power of the Western mindset , also in the 19th century . #% No government should be forgiven bad manners and inappropriate behaviour . #% Please let us , all together , put pressure on our Member States . #% Let me say to the Commission and to the others that in future we must make these Treaties simple and comprehensible to the European people ; but do not blame the Irish people for making a truly democratic decision . #% More than 80 % of European people are against war in Iraq . #% Cruelty to animals most often occurs when the animals have left the farm . #% Also , on matters exclusively for the Czech people - electing their leader , what stance they should take with regard to negotiations with their accession to the European Union , and particularly at a time when confidence building is required both within the EU and within the accession countries - do you think it is right that you as an official and a Member of the College of Commissioners should be interfering with the democratic wishes of the Czech people , or indeed the people of any country ? #% It is important to remember that the budget is there to support policy decisions taken either by the Council or by the Council and Parliament jointly . #% However , while short-term food aid is vital to respond to emergencies and rapidly deteriorating situations , EU food aid policy must work towards long-term security in food supply for the countries in question . #% Madam President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for their involvement in the debate this evening . #% There is a growing understanding of the efforts that the European Union is making , and I would say that for the many years during which the Common Fisheries Policy has existed , the Union has failed , to a large extent , to convince the European public of the importance of the role it has been playing in trying to establish the facts of marine life , to provide the public with the scientific information and to take the necessary action . #% It is essential that this element , and the amendments in relation to best available technology , be supported by Parliament . #% In particular , should it not be a matter of concern for the Council that those two states have indulged in five years of default in terms of producing a voluntary code of practice for those implementation bodies under the SEUPB ? #% Some of them have been dealt with , but I would like to re-emphasise them . #% In order to boost competitiveness , growth and employment , the Finnish Government rightly intends to promote the co-ordination of economic , employment and structural policies and to complete the internal market . #% However , it has to be recognised that even if negotiations had progressed so far that the declaration of statehood was non-controversial , the future of Jerusalem was always going to re-ignite controversy once again . #% Thirty-four pages of guidelines have been produced by the Commission for the operation of regional programmes . #% Mr President , it is quite clear to me that the Commission 's proposal is indisputably an assault upon taxation as an exclusive competence of Member States . #% It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State . #% It is equally important that the high emotions that exist at this time do not cause us to exaggerate our differences across a range of policy matters . #% Until they actually realise that they are totally in the wrong here they can not point the finger at anyone else . #% The difficulty for the European Union is that while we have grand plans for rural development , we do not have the budget to fund those plans . #% Secondly , the agreements between the Member States -- regarding the types of care , and the range and level of services that will be available to people -- will also help to clarify the situation for many people . #% We need to develop a new generation of vehicles . #% As well as providing important political and moral support the international community should provide substantial funding to underwrite the peace process . #% The Council is committed to a full-blown strategy by 2004 . #% We should have the same charges throughout Europe . #% At least now , late in the day , we have agreed to head the UN peacekeeping force that is going to Lebanon . #% I find comments made this week in Dublin by a scientist Dr Sue Lon - who is BNFL 's director of operations and technology - that the UK has a safety record which would bear up to the closest scrutiny rather sickening . #% When was the last time a pharmacist shot another pharmacist to control the drugs market in his area ? #% Organised crime in Europe has been at least ten steps ahead of us , taking advantage of weaknesses in our legal and economic systems . #% While the European Parliamentary Labour Party very much supports the work of the rapporteur Mr Zingaretti on the proposal for Criminal Sanctions for the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights , we continue to have serious reservations on the Commission proposal to rush to extend criminal sanctions to first pillar legislation before the completion of current hearings at the ECJ . #% The authorities have been reckless in allowing the Norwegian multinational , Dinochem , to start construction of a glue manufacturing plant at Marino Point . #% I suggest that we need to guarantee that people 's pensions will actually improve if they accept working for longer , particularly those who may be on small pensions . #% With regard to what Mr Nicholson has said , I know there has been a perception in the past that the nationalist communities have benefited to some extent over the unionists , but I think that criticism has now been redressed . #% I attended a Floods Forum in Ireland last week and there were many expressions of gratitude when I mentioned it was to be voted in Parliament today . #% When the Commission took the scientists ' message to the Council of Ministers it was not heeded and its advice was not put into effect . #% Services contribute 70 % of European GDP , and I urge you to proceed with the Services Directive . #% Today , sadly , we are now importing people into the health-care sector in large numbers because we have such a shortage of skills . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this resolution which welcomes the Commission White Paper on an EU strategy for climate change adaptation and proposes a range of measures across several policy fields . #% Mr President , I should just like to thank the President-in-Office for the care and attention , as a politician , that he has shown in listening to the debate and the concerns that have been raised . #% This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States , to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers . #% There have been two occasions when officials from the Commission came to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and their performance and what they told us was not only unacceptable , it was abysmal and it was a disgrace . #% I know there is a difference , but animals must be respected and they must be protected . #% 
Most importantly of all , this is an attempt to undermine a project in progress for the good of all the peoples of Europe . #% The Russian Government is being supported by the Western states and in particular by the European Union , and it seems to me that we have a responsibility to bring to the attention of the Russians our abhorrence and our horror at what is happening there . #% My group is strongly in favour of it and welcomed the moves in that direction . #% This view ignores the fact that , due to natural constraints , Europe is simply not able to produce the quantities of soya and maize necessary to meet the demand of our farmers at a viable price . #% I do not want to see Dublin being sidelined . #% In this House , we have representatives from the political party Sinn Féin who , by their own admission , have a special relationship with the IRA and that is why we refer to them . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his very detailed answer . #% Our farmers need policy stability in order to plan for the future of their businesses and the livelihood of their families . #% Democratic elections were held in 1993 , which gave some hope for the resolution of this bloody conflict . #% In this context , I would ask the Commission to have another look at the public aid section in its proposed actions before coming forward with the formal proposals . #% I welcome the initiatives that were taken at the informal meeting . #% My group warmly appreciates the further endorsement by the European Council of this historic agreement and its renewed commitment that the Union should continue to play an active part in promoting lasting peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland . #% Who in fact makes the profit ? #% The last eurobarometer poll showed the European project has never been less loved . #% I will , however , move on now to the economic part of the Spring Summit , focusing upon two aspects : progress in innovation and enterprise , and environmental protection . #% I should like to say we much appreciate all the hard work he has also done , and indeed all the Commissioners . #% In the last month alone five young Irish drug dealers - and I admit they should not have been doing it - moved to the Netherlands because it was more comfortable for them to be there . #% However , we must not forget that we are now in danger of creating a new class of technologically illiterate people , who will be denied access to this new , wonderful information highway and society which we are creating . #% We have had a positive letter from Robin Cook , the President-in-Office , but we need to move forward now on the more fundamental items . #% Sadly , for those 400 massacres committed by the government , paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups , not one person was brought to trial . #% China has long favoured an exemption from that treaty for so-called peaceful nuclear explosions . #% However , I am confident that , utilising the new legal base , we can begin once again to put this issue on the map . #% Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work . #% I suggest it is a step too far and one that nation states should rightly resist . #% Finally , I believe that within an ever-increasing global market operating under WTO rules , which , by the way , the EU is strongly supporting , this differentiation will become irrelevant , if not a complete nonsense . #% Mr President , the publicly-owned postal company in Ireland , An Post , is currently struggling for survival . #% It surprises me that some Members are against that , whereas they are very much in favour of tax harmonisation between Member States . #% Indeed , as a moneysaving device , companies providing school transport under government contracts are obliged to permit three children to use a twoperson seat . #% That said , the report is extremely ambitious . #% It is highly insulting and arrogant of you to be treating the House in this manner ! #% It is not appropriate that any citizens should be unilaterally dispossessed of the property that they enjoy . #% There is no need to be an alarmist . #% It will be there for some time to come . #% in writing . - I voted for this report to support the fishing industry in Ireland and Europe over the longer term . #% The fight against crime also demands strong cooperation between Member States if the activities of drug smugglers , money launderers and organized crime syndicates - all of whom operate on the international stage - can be effectively and comprehensively tackled by the forces of law and order in our individual countries . #% in writing . - I voted today in favour of this report , which is progressive in nature as it aims to promote equality between men and women including in areas of parental leave , child care , domestic violence and the pay gap . #% If you look through the lists which have been mentioned before - whether it be Italian milk quotas , whether it be olive oil in the Mediterranean , whether it be sheep in the United Kingdom and Ireland , whether it be the number of cattle in Corsica - you will find that in every single case it was the Member State that failed , not the European Commission . #% Some of those individual rights and common good goals mean that individual freedom of action and movement is diminished , but the purpose is not to restrict a person from doing something they want to do , but because it is for the greater good to ensure that person can not do it . #% Finally , could you indicate what statistics you have with regard to the number of posted workers and labour inspectorates in the various Member States and the effectiveness of those inspectors ? #% The enlargement countries will be greatly helped by simplification of the implementation rules . #% We are now 20 years on and if we continue with the same principle as we had in 1983 then small countries like Ireland will be worse off . #% The response of the global community to this natural disaster has been amazing and I commend all of those who are helping with the relief effort or funding the relief effort from home . #% I take the point about the Commission 's proposals and I look forward to discussing this further with the Commission when we have a result from Copenhagen . #% We had a prime minister once who said ` there is no alternative ' . #% No doubt the discussions this year in Council will be difficult . #% Mr President , Mr President-designate , at the last full part-session of the European Parliament , we are facing a worried electorate in a continent at war . #% The Irish Government was wrong and now Mr McHugh has found ways to get around the Commission to basically facilitate himself . #% Does it tally with rural development ? #% Our standard of living has now reached the EU average for the first time ever . #% in writing - The emergency package that has been proposed by the Commission is a step towards putting a stop to the precarious situation faced by European fishermen . #% Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that . #% This company has seen a 40 % jump in share prices as a result of the events of 11 September and thereafter . #% I would have this strength of feeling with regard to America , as much as with Nigeria or any other country in the world that continues to use the death penalty . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the five rapporteurs and the Commission , who have steadfastly showed their willingness to listen to the European Parliament , both in the Caudron report and since . #% Commissioner , bearing in mind that the IRA is believed after its Northern Bank robbery to have exploited money-laundering opportunities in Bulgaria , what specific steps are being taken to ensure that the authorities and organisations there , and indeed in Romania , are ready and able to implement the legislative requirements on money laundering and terrorist financing ? #% It creates minimum safety standards and puts in place access requirements which will be good for elderly people with reduced mobility and parents with prams boarding urban buses . #% The quality of Irish beef is renowned . #% Will I have to vote against Turkish accession or will I feel a little goodwill on the part of Turkey some time soon ? #% Tremendous effort has been made to facilitate a first reading conclusion of this dossier before the end of the legislative period . #% It is inconceivable that the British Government should set out to justify not only the continuity of Sellafield in its present dangerous condition , but also wish to add further to its operations by commissioning the MOX processing facility . #% I had this experience about two years ago in Northern Ireland when we went through a very similar exercise . #% Thus , it would be unhelpful for me at this stage to elaborate further . #% Scepticism and climate change are two phenomena that have become so closely interlinked in the global debate on the future of our planet , that we are in danger of losing sight of the very real steps that have been taken , under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms , towards setting a framework for future action to control the impact of human activities on the earth . #% People with disabilities are looking to Europe to help them achieve their full freedom and dignity as European citizens . #% It is one of the key issues in this draft directive . #% All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance . #% 
The green rate for these payments has been frozen at a favourable level since 1995 and therefore has not been subject to currency fluctuations . #% Indeed business and the environmental NGOs have been on the same wavelength during this process , which is not always the case . #% The collapse of the beef market is undoubtedly the most serious catastrophe to hit European agriculture and indirectly , employment in the agri-food sector . #% So the Ombudsman and the European Parliament 's Petitions Committee are , in a sense , complementary to each other . #% I agree with that approach , as there is no need for any further harmonisation across Europe . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts to strengthen the programme and I hope that in the future we can work together to prioritise EU action to combat social exclusion . #% Mr President , I sat here throughout the debate yesterday on the statements by the Commission and the Council in relation to the tragedy in the United States . #% in writing . - I voted for Sweden 's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court of Auditors and replace Lars Heikensten . #% Even now they want to garner for themselves the glory that flows to each nation state from the medals won there . #% The arrival of new Member States with a high level of dependency on agriculture will , naturally , have major implications for the common agricultural policy . #% Securing the continuation of social partnership with our unions , employers , farmers and government and , through it , wage moderation has to be a priority for our government given its huge contribution to our economic success over many years . #% I have said it to the Commissioner - and the Commissioner agreed with Mr John Hume and myself and Mr Nicholson - that we were streets ahead of other parts of the Community as far as animal health is concerned . #% We as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction . #% We need to look at the circumstances relevant in every geographical part of this Union , from Lapland to the Greek Islands and we need the renewable energy that is appropriate for every part of the EU . #% Nobody should ever be allowed to use the cloak of Irish Republicanism to hide the murder of an innocent person when the motives have no political justification whatsoever . #% Finally , I want to endorse the call that is made in the report for Member States to recognize the rights and needs of the travelling community , in particular their accommodation needs , their medical needs and indeed their education needs . #% This report , while with merit , does require further clarification on certain aspects and therefore I have chosen to abstain on this vote at this time . #% Article 176 of the Treaty explains this mechanism relating to the environment or the Article 175 laws . #% Mr President , first of all , I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% - On balance , this is an excellent report with the exception of paragraphs 52 to 56 . #% A ceasefire was brokered by Nelson Mandela in 2002 but later collapsed . #% That is where the emphasis should be . #% With respect , I do not agree - my country does not agree - that by stealth the present position should be eroded . #% It does not help that the industry itself acts in a secretive way when a problem occurs . #% Since then she has been in at least four different prisons including an all-male prison , despite the fact that she is four months pregnant and not well . #% No doubt he will not be able to tell us everything but perhaps he could throw some light on the situation . #% It is not anti-American to criticise extraordinary rendition or to push to establish facts , particularly if there are accusations against EU Member States in this regard . #% I believe Ireland will vote `` no '' on 7 June in spite of the sneers of some elites here and elsewhere and that result will be welcomed all over Europe . #% Have you forgotten the unanimous agreement on radical reform of the CAP that you personally endorsed and your government signed up to only 18 months ago ? #% Political spying is a greater threat than economic spying . #% But the leadership of Sinn Féin and the IRA has the power and influence to bring the thugs and criminals who murdered Robert McCartney to justice if it so wants . #% Madam President , in the context of these issues , a teething problem has arisen with the four-day week in relation to transport . #% We need more international cooperation between law enforcement agencies . #% This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it . #% Surely we owe that to our public authorities , to our consumers and indeed to our businesses . #% There is no way out of this . #% Madam President , the proposal which I have made and I shall repeat is that we should consider holding the debate at 15.00 hrs followed by the urgency debate , followed by votes on the report , other reports that are completed in debate and urgencies this afternoon . #% It is a small sector , but I share Mr Parish 's concern that any crack in confidence will destroy it . #% Please tell us that . #% The headline reads : ' `` States that reject the Treaty may have to leave the EU '' says Prodi ' . #% These decisions must not become part-time hostages in the heat of election campaigns . #% This woman - a mother of ten children , a 37-year-old widow - was abducted , murdered and buried in a secret location nearly 30 years ago . #% This is my greatest fear about this experimentation and I believe those fears are well-founded in some of the statements made , such as those of Dr Antinori . #% From an agricultural perspective , we must not allow the United States to dictate agricultural policy . #% As many have mentioned , 40 % of our energy is consumed in buildings . #% They have , through their trade union , acquired skills in order to pass them on to their pupils . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for her answer , if you could call it that . #% I thank my shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation , which has enabled us to get to this stage , and also my committee colleagues for their cooperation . #% Mr President , from 2000 to 2006 , my Member State , the UK , will have received over EUR 9 billion in direct EU structural fund support , topped up with match funding and private sector support . #% SAIVs -- sophisticated alternative investment vehicles , or hedge funds , as they are generally known -- and derivatives have benefited over the last few years from the stock market downturn , as they did from the widening of the field of investors that the stock market experienced during the booming 1990s , when areas of investment that had previously been largely confined to experienced and qualified financial experts or fund managers were democratised as individuals and smaller groups new to the market put their money into shares at that time . #% Compare this with the lack of European regulation or competition checks on arms movements from the EU to third countries . #% The SME 's of Agriculture do not appear to have been protected or supported in the world of GM food production . #% We very much appreciated the support we received from that country in eliminating violence on our own island . #% The countries involved worked together in their common interests -- for economic development , for example -- spilling their sweat and not their blood . #% Are we going to treat people who are unfortunate enough to be seeking asylum or fleeing persecution as criminals ? #% I have mixed feelings and some doubts . #% Mr President , first of all I want to say that we very often discuss the budget as if it were an end in itself . #% We still have more to do , but at least we have made a positive start to it . #% I am convinced that the creation of a democratic , viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state on the basis of existing negotiated agreements is the best guarantee for the security of Israel . #% Mr President , within the last two weeks the ILO has adopted a new convention on global labour standards which includes the right to join unions and bargain collectively . #% These job losses in turn affect nearly every aspect of an economy . #% Finally , I would like to know what the Council 's response is to the FAO warning in a report last August that only 24 % of the USD 507 million needed to provide food assistance until the next harvest in April 2003 has been pledged and that agricultural inputs are needed to help farmers recover from the crisis . #% Governments should provide more information and make clear to the public the scale and effects of environmental crime because many sections of our society are unaware of this . #% There must be greater flexibility within this system no matter how stringent the rules are to ensure that all sectors and all businesses in the European Union have an opportunity to secure accreditation under the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme . #% Again , Taoiseach , I welcome you here this morning and you have my sincere good wishes for a very successful term at the helm of Europe . #% If we are to have any credibility whatsoever in relation to human rights and international law we must insist that all Member States respect those norms . #% 
The legal clarity regarding LIBE reports is unclear in light of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% I very much welcome this and voted in favour of her report . #% Poland is one of the significant countries from which much of this is being broadcast . #% What is the breakdown of these alerts between farmed fish and wild fish ? #% The Iraqi people have suffered death and destruction for the past eleven years under the United States sanctions , as have the people of Afghanistan . #% He is calling for an integrated cohesion strategy which means that we include EMU , regional policies and all relevant policies in the processes of cohesion . #% Mr McCreevy , I was once lost in the rural roads of your home county . #% The recent report entitled ` Child Abuse on the Internet ' , along with other research , indicates the scale of paedophile abuse of information technology . #% Football in Europe is big business and it is essential that fair play and integrity are at the heart of the sport . #% A rest period on a vehicle can not be considered as a rest period for a number of reasons . #% I must commend the rapporteur , Mr Bakopoulos , on this report . #% I would like to see an indicative programme issued by the Commission and monitored throughout the Member States . #% It is very important that both small and large businesses contact their local banks and estimate how much currency they will require to carry out their businesses commencing 1 January next . #% May I thank the Commission for that programme and Mrs Perez Latorre in particular for her help in mounting the exhibition . #% The attention that the European Parliament gives the UN is most important . #% There is still a distance to go , however : only 36 % of people are aware of the length of the dual circulation period , which in my country has been shortened to 9 February 2002 . #% Since then , as you know , we have had Portugal , Belgium , Holland , Spain , Denmark , Germany , Italy and Austria . #% Benefits can accrue for business from the use of the Internet and the related e-commerce opportunities . #% Therefore , I welcome the Commission 's assurances here today . #% I believe we have mixed up our foreign policy with our fisheries policy . #% Budget neutrality is now but another EU promise whistling in the wind . #% Thankfully there is now an awareness among citizens of the importance of protecting the natural environment , and in my view the social and economic climate is conducive to achieving this objective . #% Let us put our money where our mouth is , look at FP7 and invest in this area . #% If our own history in Europe has taught us anything , if our own experience of conflict resolution within the European Union or indeed in the wider world has taught us anything , it is that only through negotiation and dialogue can we actually achieve a lasting and just settlement . #% Members of this House are kept in the dark and covered with manure like mushrooms , and it is about time it stopped ! #% I still feel the question about imposing an arms embargo on Indonesia has not been answered . #% Through our perseverance Parliament has clearly improved on the original proposal . #% . Mr President , unfortunately the credibility of the European Union has been increasingly questioned over the past few weeks . #% Where you have a potential 30 % to 40 % saving , which is the case in some of these countries , how absurd that this is not the first strategy , top of the list on every occasion way beyond building unnecessary nuclear reactors . #% I certainly welcome that . #% Madam President , this is a good time for us to debate this issue because there is a serious escalation in human rights problems in Kenya and there will be an election there in December . #% The Council has asked for a proposal for a recovery plan , which the Commission proposed in 2001 , but the Council still does not seem to have the courage to adopt it . #% I would like to have had more time to examine this aspect of the proposal and , if necessary , to have had time to strengthen these measures even further . #% Madam President , I did not wish to speak at all but since the President of the PSE Group appears to be upset that I am doing too little to promote liberalism in Europe by not having a resolution , I should point out to the honourable Member that in my group we looked at the precedents . #% Johannesburg did not achieve everything , but there has been genuine progress nonetheless . #% The fact is that the sanctions were imposed by the Council . #% While the Italian Government 's timetable is certainly ambitious , it can be achieved under the right circumstances . #% One of the school initiatives was that there should be one computer for every 15 pupils . #% It is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the world continues to increase military expenditure and reduce expenditure on aid . #% The European Trade Union Confederation ( ETUC ) fully supports the Report as offering a fair deal to workers across the EU . #% It looks as though the Commission , in its suggestions , is aware of the need to include the sustainable development dimension . #% I am delighted by the fact that Regulation 2560 of 2001 has now come into operation as of 1 July . #% However , I am left with some questions about the effectiveness of the controls up to the point of the outbreak of the first disease . #% The future of the rural economy depends on the success or otherwise of our future policy from 2007 to 2013 . #% I would like to see some kind of balance sheet presented to us . #% My second reason is , as we have seen in the recent past with the conflict in Iraq , the instability with regard to the price of oil , and the effect that it can have on the economies here in Europe that are so dependent on fossil fuels . #% Will we see the self-control of the meat industry by employees working as meat inspectors ? #% The Commission Report estimates that 6 000 agents are active in the EU , generating a turnover of over EUR 200 million for the transfer of players and athletes . #% We argue therefore that there is now a need , in the light of ten years ' experience of the Ombudsman 's office , to review its statute . #% This is an ambitious target . #% Planned Israeli withdrawals from some towns in the West Bank have been cancelled and the Israeli army has been active against Palestinians in Gaza . #% Consideration must be given to suspending the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements which exist between the Union and Israel if Israel 's military attacks on the Palestinian people continue . #% European farmers have signed up to a reform deal that involves tremendous upheaval in the sector , but at least they know where they are heading . #% We must respond to terrorism politically , economically and socially . #% I want to wish you every success , on behalf of Parliament , during your term of office . #% In relation to the second part of the honourable Member 's question : I feel this is something which needs consideration , and I will certainly bring his comments to the attention of the presidency and the Council when these matters are being considered . #% I believe this is an important right , which should be left in the domain of national Member States . #% It is absolutely essential that the measures we discussed on money laundering and related issues are harmonized and that we bring Europe 's laws up to date . #% That is a matter for Member States to apply themselves . #% We also have to look at how it will impact on foreigners , for example people from different cultural and religious backgrounds - some people in Western society are extremely wary of them . #% The sooner that is done the better . #% This is the sort of positive action which makes sense to European citizens . #% I would appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to end the violence in the Middle East and to put in place a negotiated settlement , based on the principles of existing agreements . #% While exposure levels peaked in the 1970s , it takes years for many asbestos-related cancers to emerge . #% Again , we have not been telling the story as it is . #% Therefore , I am extremely disappointed that the Commission have not reinstated the policy prior to December 2001 - that was the safety capacity clause . #% 
But we must also look to the future and ensure that there are no more victims , because political solutions will be found to the differences in Spain , France , and the European Union as a whole . #% The problem is , firstly , that I still stand by the allegations I have made as regards the fact that you can not justify the expenditure on the new building and it has to be investigated . #% I alert the House , not for the first time , to the serious threat to the survival of that model because of long-term uncertainty and the availability of alternative , attractive and more financially rewarding employment for young people who would in normal circumstances take up farming as a career . #% In Israel , the level of sustained assault was such that a powerful response was necessary . #% From a consumer perspective , labelling is , of course , part of the resolution of this problem . #% Our role , our duty and our responsibility , be it in world trade or in the United Nations , or even within our own development aid actions , should be to ensure , first and foremost , that when we speak about globalisation we place people at the centre of the debate . #% We need ongoing investment in research and development across all of the range of activities in rural regions . #% In Ireland , as in all of the European Union , all sectors must play their part in tackling global warming . #% Like many others here today , I greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq . #% Enlargement has triggered the destruction of the cooperation of the sovereign states of Europe and brought about the construction of the sovereign superstate of Europe , the new Tower of Babel . #% Let us not forget that we have within our ambit a raft of powers and a series of measures which we can utilize . #% It just goes to show the attitude that the EU has towards asylum seekers and refugees : automatically the first thing they are classified as is criminals . #% However , people in the developing countries can not afford to pay the exorbitant prices for the medicines needed to treat sufferers of AIDS and other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis . #% Securing guarantees of food supply will help to combat the corrosive poverty which exists in these countries and serve as a basis for long-term development and restructuring . #% I believe that certain aspects of the CAP have long been in need of review . #% If there is any way that we in Parliament and my group can assist , we are ready to try to do so . #% That would lead to American companies , Japanese companies , or other companies patenting the very ideas that European software developers , European innovators , have come up with and forcing those same European innovators to have to buy them back . #% We must also look at the whole legislative process implied by what is being called for in this report . #% However , there are wider issues here . #% I do not believe that quotas will improve matters , but I think we need quotas to keep our broadcasters under control so that they do recognize our desire for our programmes made in our own languages and in our own way . #% That is why it was so important , as the Commissioner rightly said , that funding was restored through the emergency mechanism . #% in writing . - Relations between the US and the European Union have always been strong . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteurs and I welcome the Commission 's second progress report . #% Why then do we have to try so hard to defy the natural order and create a synthetic substitute , when in our Member States we can all enjoy the real thing ? #% We have to look at the real options of dealing with waste : reduction , reuse , recycle . #% Therefore , we are fighting the next argument rather than dealing with the current debate . #% But what can we offer besides more rhetoric in this already over-opinionated debate ? #% It was story of the century in its impact on farming and how we do our business and on the animal feed industry . #% I am delighted to see that under the local social capital programme 1 % of the proposed new regulations under the ESF would be given towards that . #% It is because of these very barbaric practices , in addition to religious persecution and political persecution . #% Again , I ask why do we have to wait for a crisis to provoke action ? #% Maybe you could tell us , Commissioner , what has happened between 10 March and today ? #% On the Irish market less than 1 % of food is organic . #% Coastal populations have also further increased and , at present , about 50 % of the EU ' s population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast . #% I do not actually favour the European arrest warrant but , at the very least , minimum guarantees have to be put in place before any more legislation is agreed by the European Union . #% I welcome the proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to farming . #% We in the Green EFA group have also called for judicial and army reform , as provided for in the Arusha accords of 2000 , and an end to impunity for those who continue to perpetrate human rights abuses . #% We have to recognise that , particularly when the weather gets as hot as it did this week , colleagues ' health is under a great deal of stress . #% Dialogue is the only way forward if we are to end the violence in the Middle East at this time . #% The cost , not only to the Exchequer and to the European Union , but the real cost of the loss of these animals , is enormous . #% From my experience the European Commission was more open to representations and information exchange with the agriculture industry than most departments of agriculture in most Member States . #% We need to stop this so that consumers can benefit from the price reductions to farmers . #% Mr President , I do not propose to prolong this issue , but I believe that the rules you are implementing in relation to these one-minute speeches are undermining their effectiveness and importance to individual Members of this House , many of whom , because they come from small delegations , have little or no opportunity to put on record constituents ' current concerns . #% There is also a grave responsibility on us all to ensure we demonstrate that international law applies to us all , and not just to Iraq , and to ensure that the United Nations is given its full legitimacy in the current situation . #% Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning . #% Following the final vote in committee I was asked if I would be prepared to accept an amendment in plenary to modify the title of the report , which refers to ` fishermen ' , so as to implicitly recognise the important role played by women in that important sector . #% In response to questions I put about the continuation of the bombing of Iraq and sanctions on Iraq , the Commission showed no concern for the fact that 5 to 6 000 children have died because of sanctions on Iraq . #% Most of the Colombian military forces continue to be implicated in serious human rights abuses and their aiding and abetting of paramilitary atrocities are basically ignored by the Colombian authorities . #% There are all sorts of things going round in space from space vehicles to hardware to power tools to teapots . #% The report is therefore a good basis for consideration but we must not do anything rash until we see properly how the Single Market with freedom of movement for people and money interacts with taxation policy and fair competition . #% Ironically , the values-driven Union provided for by the Constitution is needed to address the concerns of many of the ` no ' voters in France and the Netherlands . #% There are two issues in relation to the mid-term reform before us . #% We need talks between the government the SPDC , the National League for Democracy and ethnic groups , with all groups having an equal level of participation . #% Finally , I am glad to see that the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office , today at least , are sharing a platform in the European Parliament . #% Energy efficiency in the developing world is abysmal . #% Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January . #% I want to say to Prime Minister Verhofstadt , with regard to the Ghent Council , that my group totally supports the clearest and most unequivocal assurances you have given of total solidarity with the United States . #% It is a lesson which tells us that when we attempt to throw things away there really is no such thing as `` away '' . #% As a Union and a Parliament we have to stand by access for all to high-quality , affordable services , and we must recognise that those services dictate the quality of life of our citizens . #% We want an international peacekeeping force . #% You can not intervene in domestic politics as a Portuguese politician ; that is not acceptable . #% My group and I are calling for a European research project aimed at harmonising calculation methodologies . #% Would the President-in-Office agree that , if any other legislature in the European Union took decisions and then issued its minutes and some notes about what discussions had gone on and offered to put the information on an Internet site , people would think there was something very undemocratic and shady about it ? #% I commend Mr Watson on his report . #% The report paints a shocking picture of human rights abuse and illegal activity , all of which was tolerated by Member States including Ireland . #% Mr President , the statistics in relation to world hunger are indeed staggering . #% 
I am delighted to be one of the ten MEPs in the European Parliament group in the EU delegation . #% Other EU institutions will not be permitted by the European Parliament in the future to recommend in any shape or form a reduction in the budgets available for road safety campaigns . #% I had expected that the Members of the European Parliament would be given an opportunity to cast a vote on the changes to the treaty being introduced following the Amsterdam Summit . #% An intrinsic element of this relates to the need to put in place more expansive childcare facilities heretofore which simply have not been in existence . #% It is not uncommon to have fields that were under water for several weeks every year to now be the site of estates with 200 houses . #% Everyone , at this stage , will recognise that climate change is having a major impact on our coastal areas . #% The chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has a proposal that would secure more money for investigating the effects of the measures already in place . #% I have spoken many times in this Chamber on the European Institute of Technology and the wonderful advance and focal point for excellence that would represent . #% It does not add to production in any way and it is a relatively small amount of money . #% Face up to it : the goal of ever-closer , stultifying political union is simply unobtainable ! #% We need to ensure that stocks are maintained and , if there is a crisis , that measures are taken to reduce the fishing effort . #% But it is too early to say precisely where we go beyond 1999 . #% In relation to the public interest , surely in many of these cases the public interest should take priority ? #% Unlike what was done in relation to agriculture , I would invite Mr Fischler to consult this House on the fisheries proposals . #% It is imperative that proposals for severe penalties for those convicted of sexual exploitation and trafficking should be followed through . #% Finally three very quick points which I do not have the time to develop . #% I have always believed it is very important that there is equality of representation with regard to the future composition of the European Commission . #% Whilst the euro can help promote economic growth , it can not do that on its own without sensible fiscal policies and sound economic management in each Member State . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , I understand I have some injury time for not being able to get in at the beginning of the debate . #% It is fundamental to civilized life that people enjoy equal rights under the law . #% For years , the UK Government has totally failed fishermen and the fishing industry . #% Turkey is doing its accession cause no good . #% They in fact give us far more and offer us far more in terms of a peaceful , secure and prosperous future than we can offer them . #% Under Urban II in my constituency in Northern Ireland , we benefited from a very worthwhile programme in North Belfast . #% They therefore lose out on many benefits and entitlements . #% We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court . #% I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question . #% The European Commission , the European Parliament and the Member States of the European Union agreed to establish the ` Youth in Action ' programme , which puts into effect the legal framework to support non-formal learning activities for young people . #% The Provisional IRA is now a key player in this field . #% If nothing is planted , famine will result . #% However , previous peace processes can act as a guide to what might happen , the kind of difficulties to be overcome and the challenges to be faced . #% In addition , a central task of the presidency will be to prepare the second annual report on employment for the Dublin Council in December . #% They tell me of a lack of access to these children and difficulties in getting the children back once they have been on access visits in another country . #% In evaluating the relevance of agriculture to the European and world economy , you can not apply the same economic criteria as we apply to other sectors . #% So where Europe can act together on this , it should be encouraged . #% I have never before seen more harmony or unanimity in the House . #% Mr President , in an ideal world positive discrimination should not be necessary but , unfortunately , we do not live in an ideal world . #% In my own country the vast majority of people are against the militarisation of Europe , especially a Europe that will have nuclear weapons at its disposal , a Europe where the arms industries are exporting arms to places around the world where there are mass and gross abuses of human rights . #% Is it the legitimate forces of law and order or the drug barons operating throughout Europe with their vast fortunes and their hit-men striking terror into our towns and cities ? #% Mr President , I did not want to make this point during my speech , but it is necessary that it should be made . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply . #% That it did not reflects badly on those who blocked the conclusion , and I include not only Poland and Spain in that criticism . #% Governments , public institutions and the Commission should lead the way by example . #% Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that British Nuclear Fuels is technically insolvent ? #% The final point I will make , Mr President , is that I agree with the rapporteur when he says that the pension system should include individualisation of pensions , social security and taxation systems . #% For that reason they were not full speed ahead directives . #% The international community should hang its head and the European Union along with it . #% This Parliament and the Commission have certainly burnt the midnight oil putting in place controls which must eliminate for all time the reoccurrence of BSE or the dioxin scare , which has cost farmers and the food sector dearly and caused so much worry to consumers . #% Mr President , the vast majority of United Kingdom citizens or indeed EU citizens were deeply shocked and dismayed at the recent events at BNFL . #% The recent BSE crisis , as well as the collapse of the Russian market for EU agricultural produce , has severely affected the workings of many individual agricultural operations , most notably the beef sector , and renationalising part of the CAP would introduce even more uncertainty into an already difficult situation . #% Three years before this , German studies were brought to the attention of EFSA by the German authorities that showed kidney damage in rats fed Monsanto 863 . #% The Commission has brought forward proposals to the Agriculture Council on this issue outlining possible courses of action . #% The EUR 80 billion surplus in structural cohesion funding would be better used if it were returned to Member States in order to specifically target the internal imbalances in disadvantaged regions struggling with poor water supply or poor road infrastructure . #% This view is shared by a majority of the Member States . #% We will not judge Commissioners on the basis of the national preferences of one or other party or group inside this Chamber . #% In this regard , I am happy to see that Mr Scottà dealt with the future of the PGI and PDO systems . #% The murder of Rosemary Nelson , and the earlier killing of Patrick Finucane , provide clear evidence that this minimum requirement for justice is not guaranteed in Northern Ireland . #% But I have a serious problem about dealing with countries like the Comoros , which has a population of half-a-million people , and a GDP per capita of USD 700 . #% I have consistently argued that the accession of Turkey could form an important bridgehead between East and West and help consolidate Turkey as a secular democracy and a calming force in an otherwise unstable region . #% Our quest for better regulation as a Parliament must start with enforceable legislation . #% If it were to be replaced by additional petrol taxes , an increase of 36 cents per litre would be necessary to make up the difference in tax take . #% This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal , Greece and Spain . #% Could the Commissioner give us any update on that ? #% Mr President , I object on the basis that we reserve the right to vote on an amendment that allows us to have no lower threshold . #% This has been one of the most important EU supports for the peace process in Northern Ireland . #% Obviously any such action will be a matter for discussion and agreement in the Council but I assure the Member we will keep the situation under close review . #% 
Employers already have a duty to assess the risk to health and safety and to introduce appropriate control measures as specified in the Framework Directive ( 89/391/EEC ) . #% We need a reform of state aids which enables more public private partnership activity in regeneration , particularly of urban areas , of derelict land sites and of buildings . #% I first came into contact with this as a political issue in the Committee on Petitions when the long and hard work done by Mr Miller came before us . #% I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000 . #% The decision taken by the people of Ireland underlines their strong commitment to European integration and enlargement of the European Union . #% My resolution has been incorporated into the joint resolution and I would ask the House to give it its full support . #% in writing . - The Commission 's Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite Systems shows there is huge demand in a market projected to be worth EUR 230 billion by 2025 . #% I hope that the summit this week takes its courage in its hands , approves this Statute and approves the outcome of the Convention . #% Mr President , we all agree that decision-making procedures within the EU institutions need to be streamlined to take account of the ten new countries which are joining the Union next May . #% But , unlike Parliament , the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the African , Caribbean and Pacific House of that Assembly are not constantly in session , and the structures are not there to cope with that level of scrutiny . #% I hope that the Commission examines it very carefully . #% This topic has been the subject of debate for a long time : sometimes heated , sometimes misrepresented , sometimes taken in the wrong way . #% Earlier this week I called on the Irish Government to bring forward proposals which will have the effect of totally banning television adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat , salt and sugar and which specifically target children under the age of 16 . #% Within the Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime is being put in place , following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% Financial institutions and stakeholders , which have enjoyed years of excessive returns on equities and excessive annual bonus payouts , must contribute their fair share to meeting the costs . #% There is every justification for us to debate it . #% Secondly , I support the rapporteur 's call to all Member States to ensure that women have equal access to social insurance schemes . #% I believe that it will serve to reinforce values and norms which are already well established in many Member States . #% However , you will be pleased to know that this evening the Conference of Presidents has approved the change in the title of my report . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank Prime Minister Vanhanen and President Barroso for their presentation here this morning . #% Mr President , it is extremely important that we have a legally-binding convention on the issue of people with disabilities . #% I am also delighted that our group initiated the proposal to have the debate here yesterday because it is important that Parliament 's views are expressed clearly and that our continuing good will is seen publicly . #% My experience in the last 12 months has been that the United States has not been engaged or focused and , to some extent , we must make it understand how Europe operates and works at this moment . #% I am also pleased that relations between parent companies and subsidiaries have been better defined . #% There is no reason why we should not do so , especially in cases where scientifically validated alternatives to animal testing are available . #% It requires skills and knowledge passed from generation to generation of families . #% Unlike Mr Evans , we think that is important . #% It is hurtful to be accused of being anti-American simply because one is opposed to the policy of the current US Administration . #% Recently we have seen headlines in Dutch and Irish newspapers about jet aircraft being chartered to fly workers from the west of Ireland to jobs in the Netherlands because the Netherlands can not get workers to do this work . #% Combined , our gross domestic product represents more than half the world 's GDP , and we have the worlds strongest bilateral trade partnership , making up almost 40 % of world trade . #% In particular , when we mention imposing similar restrictions on self-employed people we are in danger of becoming too much of a nanny state where we try to control everything and regulate what everyone does . #% The documentation and the serious scientific research has been in print since 1997 and it sits there gathering dust . #% I know you will be tough on our behalf . #% The Council and the Commission were on one side and Parliament on the other . #% If it were more open and more transparent , it would be more reassuring to those who have legitimate cause to be concerned . #% During that visit we met the Iranian Foreign Minister , Mr Kharrazi , and other members of the government and parliament to discuss broader EU-Iranian relations at this time . #% For citizens , and indeed parliamentarians , this is a sensitive and complex issue and I do not consider myself qualified to deal with the many scientific arguments in this debate . #% It is essential that we broaden its scope and set horizontal sectoral targets . #% For example , corporation tax in my area of Northern Ireland should be radically reduced as a means of stimulating investment , thereby moving us away from over-dependence on the public sector . #% I would certainly hope those parts of the rich world that still maintain such barriers will be strongly urged by the Commission to adopt a policy such as we have done here within the European Union . #% The Services Directive could deliver 600 000 jobs more . #% Also , as this is the first opportunity I have had , I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House for this debate . #% I oppose referral back to committee . #% It is unfortunate if people pick one place or country to highlight this . #% Nor , if I was a self-employed driver and wanted to strike a fair balance between my working life and my family life , would I want someone undermining my position by being able to work 18 hours a day . #% How utterly astonishing , then , that every country in the world and every Member State of the European Union wastes half of its most valuable resource , that is , the brain power of its citizens . #% It is important that consumers are reassured in relation to electronic payments by establishing a legal framework . #% Let us get our priorities right , let us look to the future in the way I think Altener II will do . #% Judging by what was said in Parliament this morning in reply to the last President-in-Office , Prime Minister John Bruton , one can see that the emphasis is on a Europe which is closer to the people , which can take account of the people 's concerns , can react quickly and assuage fears but which , at the same time , can stir enthusiasm and passion in people . #% We now have the power of Amsterdam and I am pleased to see that with an accelerated pace we have responded to the challenge of the Cardiff conclusions . #% In spite of all the work that has been done , the whole area of industrial fishing remains , certainly to me , a little bit mysterious . #% I want to see closer cooperation between Europol and EU law enforcement . #% Instead , legislators should rely on the upper safe limits , which are a much better device . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Theato , for her work on this proposal despite the fact that I disagree with it . #% Current policy , however , places limits on the degree to which this resource can be exploited . #% The Barcelona meeting earlier this spring ensured that the ongoing development of the European economy remains a centre stage priority . #% Irish people have , regrettably , been sold the benefits of the EU solely in economic terms while the moral and political imperative of assisting the countries of eastern and central Europe to rejoin the European family of nations has not been promoted . #% Although I would have had major problems with the idea of an EU tax system - it is not something I could support - or that our salaries would be increased , we need to deal with the way in which expenses are dished out in this Parliament . #% I want to reinforce the recommendation in the rapporteur 's report that the Ombudsman should have unlimited access to documents in connection with any inquiries . #% Future plans for education programmes and commitments on the part of the donors to the developing world will have to take this into consideration . #% There is one idea and one hope that I have always entertained . #% Some of these mistakes were made through ignorance of the disease , which we should all accept was very new at the time . #% Mr President , I am glad that Commissioner Prodi pointed out the disparity between the financial costs of this war and those available to meet the needs of humanity . #% In this context , I want to express my extreme disappointment that after three trialogues , we were unable to reach agreement on the source of funding for this facility . #% Thus the same situation which gave rise to today 's debate continues to exist unaddressed by this report . #% He is a regional bully and unless he is stopped he will go on bullying . #% 
That has helped to feed the hurricanes that have devastated the US Gulf coast and the Caribbean . #% We all have to accept that this is about the protection of juvenile cod in the Irish Sea . #% On the subject of combating international terrorism , can the Council tell us what steps it took to encourage the return of three IRA members convicted of international terrorism in Colombia , who later took refuge in a Member State of the EU -- namely Ireland -- and continue to enjoy sanctuary there ? #% Environmental legislation based on design criteria , I put it to you colleagues , is without precedent , and for good reason . #% I suggest that this week , as a matter of urgency , Commissioner Nielson be called to this House to explain the delay by the European Union in responding to a drought that has been continuing for the past three years . #% I am involved in that for the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy . #% The overwhelming majority of its members are fine men trying to impartially enforce the rule of law . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Ms Stihler for drawing up this report and indeed the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% Why should 5 % hold back the other 95 % of trade ? #% We need to apply core labour standards to domestic work and ensure that those performing it are entitled to social security and protection against abusive practices . #% I am sure there are good examples , but the RUC is not one of them . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , nearly 10 million Europeans suffer today from dementia , with Alzheimer 's the most common form . #% The Karen are seeking an autonomy which the British guaranteed them when they made Burma independent in 1949 . #% Despite the faults that exist within the European system , there are also many good and positive things . #% We are all aware that the EU leaders will be meeting in Laeken later this year to agree the format of a structured debate on Europe ' s future . #% Mr President , I was very disappointed to have to vote against the report at the end . #% The body of the European Union treaties and , in particular , the Single European Act , the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty are all to be reevaluated in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference . #% Commissioner , I still think you can do more for simplification . #% On the issue of Chechnya the European Union leaders were right to bring home to Russia the force of their anger at the brutality of Russian behaviour in the region . #% Yesterday the Committee on the Environment voted by 37 votes to 13 for the five amendments before us today - a clear , decisive vote right across this House from colleagues in all different groups . #% I want to see a pluralistic Europe . #% It is impossible to debate the forthcoming agricultural negotiations at the WTO without putting the matter in the context of the Commission 's mid-term review last month . #% Our desire to raise birth rates is undermined by our policies . #% The Commission itself acknowledges that they are only probable working hypotheses . #% I very much welcome the support that has been given by the European Parliament and the European Commission to promote a worldwide ban on human cloning . #% The general direction of this proposal is positive and thus it should be given time for others to have their say . #% This , in turn , means that we will have to have employment policies that are much more female-friendly than in the past : we need shorter working hours , more job-sharing and improved maternity laws . #% I also totally opposed the findings of the Committee of Inquiry in demanding that compensation money paid to UK farmers be paid back . #% As we look to the future of peace and negotiation that will take place in Spain as a result of this decision , I want to put into people 's minds the idea that ceasefires and negotiations do not mean subjugation . #% Commissioner Hübner reiterated that this evening . #% I would ask this House , therefore , to send a clear signal by adopting the resolution and to urge all the Member States to speedily conclude the negotiations , because it is even an outrage that it should be suggested in the negotiations that there could be ` peaceful ' nuclear explosions . #% Together we can make progress , bring in more of the developing countries and persuade more of our friends in the United States in particular to join us in the very important task of reducing carbon emissions . #% However , I would caution against moving too quickly from a food additive definition to a veterinary medicine definition until alternatives have been put in place and we are ready to cope with them . #% The situation as it is must now be faced . #% Gaining a workable consensus on this directive will demonstrate to our citizens that the European Union is committed to , and capable of , competing globally . #% I believe you should explain to the Council that it is not appropriate that we should , in a procedure in May , elect you as the legitimate head of what would be an illegitimate Commission . #% Will it be on entry into the country , before the border is crossed ? #% Obviously , if Kosovo , like Kuwait , were rich in oil the UN would have acted differently . #% The common agricultural policy has served Ireland well over the years and while we accept that it is in our interest that European agriculture becomes more competitive on the world market , there are very legitimate concerns about the effects of future CAP reform . #% However , I read history and I have some knowledge and understanding of it . #% Financial measures were put in place to finance these initiatives and they should be honoured accordingly . #% Because of the work I have been doing in this particular area I am very concerned about the criminal activities of some asylum seekers who are exploiting members of their own communities , through trafficking in women and young people . #% I found that South Korea had not complied with the undertaking it had given on becoming a member of the OECD in 1996 to bring its labour laws into line with internationally binding labour standards . #% We need , at the same time , to create the legal framework through access to the grid which enables it to prosper and we need a programme like ALTENER . #% The e-Europe 2005 programme will seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools to guarantee access to high-speed Internet services and increase skills development for our young people . #% There have been numerous allegations of mutilation , rape and indiscriminate firing on civilians fleeing across the Burmese-Thai border . #% I agree with most , though not all , of what has been said here . #% He has built up a reputation over many years - but in particular during the last three years in Gaza - as a broadcaster who is objective and balanced in his reporting of a very difficult situation . #% I also welcome the fact that the Member States have allocated an increase of EUR 27 million for the new LIFE programme for the next five years and that the overall budgetary allocation made to the LIFE programme will be in the region of EUR 640 million . #% Remember , this is the President who thinks he can provide world leadership . #% In the first instance we need to engage with the United States at every level . #% In particular , I welcome the clear statement that we must aim for automatic exchange of information to become the general rule . #% We need to prevent problem gambling and under-age gambling , in addition to fighting fraud and crime . #% My good wishes also go to the Dutch presidency as its term comes to an end . #% I can assure you that the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy will be looking very carefully at the ethical dimensions of the fifth framework programme . #% Many citizens , myself included , believe that there is a more acceptable , ethical and moral way forward than the one which leads us to destroy one innocent human life in order to cure another . #% We have to address that issue . #% A second power sharing deal was signed in 2003 , which finally brought three of the main rebel groups into government , although , regrettably , fighting and abuse of human rights continues in several areas . #% This news is very welcome , as it means that the Good Friday Agreement can be fully implemented and government structures or an executive set up . #% There is no EU country that has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara , but according to the Saharoui people , at the same time the EU pays EUR 500 million to Morocco . #% The consultants engaged to assist the Commission in setting the revised targets , RDC-Environment and Pira International , assumed a number of underlying principles which do not apply to some Member States , such as Greece , Portugal and Ireland . #% The Petitions Committee works , in my view , on the basis of ` soft power ' and I think the work of the last 12 months has been about trying to influence Member States who are not implementing legislation in the manner that they should to change their ways . #% With that in mind we must ensure that our approach to learning is focused on results . #% We therefore owe it to them and to ourselves to clean up our own act . #% My own colleagues have asked me to invite you , Madam President , in addition to this solemn moment , to open a book of condolence that we might also convey through that , at some appropriate time to the Congress , our interlocutor in US democracy , that in spite of the space which divides us across the Atlantic , we are resolutely united by the bonds of democracy and freedom and in the fight against terrorism . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his full answer and also to congratulate him on the efforts I know the Commission and , indeed , the Council are making to bring about more humanitarian and satisfactory conditions for democracy in that region . #% 
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market rejected the Commission 's proposal and I urge support for the amendments tabled by its chairman , Mr Gargani , which I have co-signed with other Members . #% I am glad that logic has obtained and that these funds will be subject to competition law . #% Let us ensure that we can show the same tolerance that we expect of others . #% The ELDR welcomes the decision to open the Conference on Accession at ministerial level next month . #% We encourage further study of the impact of the measures where appropriate , but with a view to ensuring full , tough and timely international implementation . #% Obviously they want to be entertained and informed . #% If the current arrangements prevent us from doing so then they should be investigated . #% I compliment her on her dedication and commitment in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection down the years and I wish her every joy and good health in the future . #% I do not want to see the continued stonewalling against all appeals to bring those responsible for this evil deed to justice . #% However a rapid , efficient , adequate and effective response coordinated across national boundaries is needed to mitigate the impacts on the environment and public health in the case of a pollution incident . #% There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets . #% Unfortunately in the two larger groups in the European Parliament , many of the German Members caved in to the lobbying by these vested interests and put the interests of money before the interests of the people and their health . #% Their only alternative would be calves from suckling cowherds . #% As Mr Mombaur has said , we look forward to working with him over the next years to ensure that something which should have happened long before at least happens now . #% Mr President , Mr Bernard-Reymond 's report constitutes a valuable contribution to the on-going and evolving debate about the nature of the relationship between China and the European Union . #% This is again a recipe for conflict and it was not in the Commission 's proposals . #% Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees , corruption , human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific region . #% We are all aware that the Commission 's proposals for the mid-term review of the CAP are due out next week . #% They arrive in a new country often illegally , without papers and are then trapped . #% I thank the Commissioner for answering my question here today . #% This is quite possible . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response to this question and also for his earlier remarks . #% The majority in this Parliament agrees with and supports the need for the European Institute of Technology , but what arrangements are there to make it happen ? #% Mr Seal 's report highly recommends many of the positive aspects of the aviation industry in recent years . #% I underline my concerns and those of my Group on the lack of proper enforcement and assistance to the enforcement agencies in this particularly important area . #% However , the Council continues to resist the idea . #% As a result of falling stocks of fish , there is a move to impose controls on shore angling and to deduct these catches from the quotas of the commercial fishing industry . #% I signal openly to the rapporteur that I will seek to remove this suggestion from what , as I have already said , is otherwise a very constructive report . #% This initiative derives from the experiences of conflict in the former Yugoslavia and , more recently , the situation in Albania . #% It is interesting to know that it will grow three times faster than the average municipal waste by 2010 - quite a frightening concept . #% in writing . - I have been a long-time supporter of a Financial Transaction Tax ( FTT ) , or as the supporters in the USA call it - a financial speculation tax ( FST ) . #% In particular , this report is a victory for disabled transport users . #% Even the d'Ancona report some months ago hyped up some very cynical arguments . #% The other issue I want to refer to is the code of good administrative behaviour . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner 's statement that we must protect minors . #% In the economic sphere two things need to happen : steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement ; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports . #% Aquaculture is a valuable source of employment and can cushion the hardship of the areas affected by the decline in fishing . #% I believe that the alternative resolution would have addressed those concerns more effectively . #% It will get time if there is no violence , and I believe the international force could break the cycle of violence . #% Evil triumphed last weekend , not in the person of those people who went out and mistakenly voted for the wrong side , but of those who told them lies and deceived them . #% On this occasion , however , they are by and large innocent victims of a situation beyond their control . #% The question that really has to be answered is : who is going to broker an end to the violence in the Middle East ? #% In any case you are leaving it to Eurostat to decide on the admissibility or otherwise of the new regions , based on the statistics available . #% I for one am not calling for a ban on the Special Olympics . #% A global fight against terrorism will be successful only if it is free of inconsistency and hypocrisy in its approach and if it tackles the injustices that feed terrorism in the first place . #% Their role models might have dominated women and not understood the concept of equality and so might not have been of the type we want our sons to become today . #% I urge the Commission to look seriously and urgently at these more immediate problems . #% Mr President , Commissioners you will be beginning to find our speeches repetitive . #% It has acted as a channel for occasional cooperation between Member States when they take measures against epidemics and other health risks . #% Scientific evidence as understood by the legislation involves expensive trialling which will cost more than small producers can afford . #% The risk threshold will eliminate the main air conditioning gas currently in use and it will allow less harmful gases to be used instead . #% That is why I welcome this European Commission proposal . #% Soil and subsoil types are important considerations in characterising the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination . #% Fair Trade is about paying poor producers a fair price and helping them gain the necessary skills and knowledge to develop their business and work their way out of poverty . #% The current legislation and self-regulation are inadequate . #% This is a sensitive issue with far-reaching political implications and one which needs further reflection . #% A year ago , it was the UK , Ireland and one or two other isolated outbreaks of BSE that was concentrating the minds , particularly the epidemic that had been experienced by the UK for some time . #% I want to know what flexibility exists for a Member State to defend its own national priorities on state aid and whether you can legally enforce these issues . #% As the Commissioner is under pressure of time , I will forego my right to ask a supplementary . #% in writing . - On balance , I can support this own initiative report from my colleague , MEP Reul . #% Madam President , I should apologise on behalf of Mr Gallagher who is not at his desk at the moment . #% We now have legislation which threatens another transatlantic trade war - but that is another issue - which does not respect best environmental practice with performance criteria and which - surprise surprise - excludes aircraft using a modern US manufactured engine while permitting the continued use of the Rolls Royce engine which conveniently has a bypass ratio of 3.1 . #% Sheikh Abdullah , one of the co-founders of the Union , said yesterday : ` He who does not perform prayer will be considered an infidel and our Sharia Law orders that person to be killed ' . #% We have to ensure that we also improve our intellectual capacity to analyse and understand exactly what is driving this new form of terrorism . #% Ask yourself exactly why Diana , Princess of Wales , was pursued everywhere she went : to make money for others . #% Many provisions of this directive have already been envisioned in the SAVE directive in 1993 . #% 
My opinion is that it is more important to feed human beings . #% The BSE crisis is a disaster for both consumers and producers alike . #% When you talk about the benefits , we need to know how they are distributed . #% The key elements of this initiative , as has been outlined , include provision of educational exchanges between colleges in Europe and other educational colleges from around the world . #% The environmental and industrial perspectives are quite different and we need to find the right balance . #% It could be argued that some of the stocks in the EU are in such desperate straits that it would be negligent or even worse to promote their consumption . #% We need a range of services to protect our children and an early-warning system to alert us to potential dangers . #% Both military organisations are committed to nuclear weapons , weapons that the International Court has deemed illegal . #% However that is an issue for another day . #% This type of behaviour has no beneficial result and must be prevented . #% Firstly I would like to associate myself entirely with the remarks of my colleague from Northern Ireland , Mr Nicholson , with regard to the atrocious situation that has befallen Annetta Flanigan , a lady who has given selfless service to Afghanistan . #% We will definitely miss you Eddy . #% It would make life a lot happier for me - and also for you Mr Bangemann . #% They are there to defend ideas . #% The long-term effects on children must be studied not just to look at accumulative effect , as we do with adult medicines , but to look at the particular effect the medicine has at different stages of a child 's development and on the health of the young adult they become . #% Cork city , where I come from , is 50 % better than Dublin and the rest of Ireland , rural Ireland we call it , is 10 % better still . #% That means the allocation of resources under the framework programme should be made applying award criteria on the model of the structural funds allocation criteria . #% I fully agree with the statement issued by the EU leaders when they expressed their deep regret at the failure of the American Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . #% Ireland and Europe can benefit by further promoting and using the scheme . #% One area we must look at is ensuring that the pension is set at a proper , reasonable standard of living to allow people to have independence and freedom of choice . #% We really need to concentrate on the fight against terrorism which is , as we all know , national , European and global , and it is a priority for the European Union . #% I would like to hear Commissioner Fischler this morning confirm the effectiveness of Ireland 's control programme which has been in operation since the first case was identified a few years ago . #% Most people agree that the current , large-scale , six-week , once-a-year UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is now outdated and needs to be replaced . #% This proposal by Mr Gallagher is to reinvolve them . #% The suggestion to reduce pesticide use by 50 % is not predicated upon any scientific data . #% I also have to congratulate here some organisations in our communities who are doing something or are trying to raise awareness , and here I would mention those voices in the wilderness who are the sanction breakers - I think they are playing a major role and I would like to voice my support here for them . #% We must implement what the directive insists on , that the postal service is available to everybody . #% I agree that it makes sense not only to provide cover for the severest cases at EUR 10 million but to limit cover to that amount for each accident . #% The oppression of Burma 's six-millionstrong Karen minority has become increasingly ferocious over the past few months . #% Madam President , like Mrs Breyer , I would like to say this is a missed opportunity . #% But generally speaking , the people who take this line are not themselves addicted , are not themselves very often in direct contact with the vast problems related to addiction , and they are complex problems . #% They need special status as sensitive areas . #% It is important , if we are going to have ratification by all 25 states , that the process in which the presidency is now engaged seeks to ensure that the people are also involved in that process . #% These common sense proposals aim to protect the most vulnerable members of our societies . #% I call on the Commission to reject the amendment before us which has the aim of preventing the transport of animals outside the European Union by eliminating export refunds . #% If the EMU is to win public confidence , this must be done . #% . -- Mr President , I welcome President Barroso and Commissioner McCreevy to the Chamber today . #% Thirdly , it is likely that rather than aligning competition , the application of a single standard across all road transport and other transport areas in some Member States will actually distort competition . #% This an area of the European economy which accounts for something like 16 % of investment and close to 9 % of employment . #% The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are basic things that anybody in a democracy would feel entitled to . #% If some Member States wish to move forward at a faster pace on specific issues , then the enhanced cooperation mechanism already exists to enable them to do so . #% Why is it that the least culpable are bearing the brunt of these proposals and other proposals that emanate in the name of conservation ? #% It is inexcusable that Australia , a country that likes to see itself as an advanced and peaceful nation , should be occupying and drilling in the gas and oil fields under the East Timor Sea , and that Australia should be justifying that robbery on the basis that Indonesia -- East Timor 's most recent exploiter -- gave it the right to drill there . #% In fact , the President-in-Office and myself are co-signatories to the Maastricht Treaty . #% We heard from a citizen of one of them earlier on . #% When it last came before us , in my report in 1995 , Parliament gave a very favourable recommendation . #% The Commissioner showed us where his heart was in the opening remarks . #% I do not believe this would be in the interest of Irish motorists . #% I would like to impress upon the new college of the Commission and all Members of the European Parliament that the events of this year must be put behind us as a matter of urgency . #% I am worried that maybe this scientific report is a way of trying to avoid reducing the time and the distance to what Parliament wanted . #% It is so important that inshore fishing be developed , making it attractive to the employment-seeking youth . #% I am as interested in animal welfare as the next man , as indeed are all farmers , and all those involved in the live export trade . #% This is an unsatisfactory situation and has contributed significantly to the depopulation of rural areas . #% There also needs to be an assurance in many Member States in relation to the right to bail : I believe people should have this right . #% When I was not here on a previous occasion I was rapped over the knuckles for not being here . #% I , of course , support the need to introduce measures which reduce costs between domestic and cross-border payments . #% Mr Ahern has accelerated the process of negotiation with other EU governments , in an effort to move quickly forward the discussions concerning the key bottom-line issues . #% Therefore , it will be no surprise to Members of the House and to the Commission that in our meetings we are asking for a continuation of the urban community initiative . #% It is extremely important , because of the financial contribution we have been making in these areas , to make the authorities accountable to the public for the way these prisoners are being treated . #% I feel that there must be more coherence by the Commission in how it approaches the needs of the textile industry . #% In particular , the report looks at mutual health organisations which have already been established and proven to work effectively in several African states . #% We are failing seriously in our duties if we can not respond to what is an emergency situation resulting from an unprecedented set of circumstances which could not have been anticipated in the context of the 1992 CAP reform . #% I do not want to discuss the question of pregnant chads or whatever they were in Florida , but like the other colleagues , I have looked at the written record and it shows 273 votes for , 272 votes against , contrary to the declaration of the result and the statistical evidence of earlier today . #% Mr President , an issue has arisen overnight concerning paragraph 5 of our resolution . #% A realistic appeal can then be made to both sides for restraint while the force is being organised and deployed . #% Labour markets do not always function efficiently , and Member States must be prepared to take up their responsibilities when the need arises . #% 
I have also been to Jenin and seen the destruction there , the destruction of homes and of people 's lives , the burying of people in the rubble of their own homes . #% It would be more sensible to refer to this post as ` Chair ' of the European Council and not ` President ' . #% One , that part of European traditional medicine which was excluded as Western allopathic medicine developed in the 19th century out of the disciplines of the apothecary and surgeon - and I speak of manipulative medicine and herbalism in particular and also of homeopathy . #% We need to engage with the Americans on a country-to-country , a union-to-union , a party-to-party , a committee-to-committee basis , at whatever level we can , not only in relation to Iraq , but in relation to the extremely dangerous unilateralist philosophy they are currently developing in regard to so many areas of world concern . #% But we must begin and we must put down a marker now . #% Mr President , I welcome this package of proposals from the Commission , particularly in the context of achieving a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses , especially the small and medium-sized enterprises , which supply goods and services to other Member States . #% Finally , there is the question of rural depopulation . #% We have the concern in Ireland that there are millions of tonnes of plutonium available in the UK and naturally enough it is worrying for us . #% Finally , I should like to make a point in relation to my own country . #% Furthermore , the most recent Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform ensures that payments will shift away from trade-distorting subsidies to payments based on services to society provided by our farmers in areas such as the environment , food safety and animal welfare . #% in writing . - Mrs Niebler has presented the report on the third extension of the EU-United States Agreement , which supports the Council decision concerning the extension of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America . #% The CAP post-2014 , as outlined in this report , has clear aims and priorities , on which European farmers can and will deliver - but they need the support of a credible budget behind them . #% I have not been guilty of manipulation of the parliamentary process . #% The controversy has focused on a single section relating to a requirement to provide information to workers about cancer risks . #% At Tampere will the transport ministers be included in these discussions on how to protect civil aviation from these threats ? #% This is not the way that people expected to be dealt with . #% Can I quote for the House , because many will not know what the direct quotes said . #% They want to `` cop-out '' of their responsibilities . #% Asylum seekers in Europe were mainly from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , Iraq and Afghanistan . #% In particular they want a cheap and user-friendly regime . #% In Parliament , as has been said , on behalf of the Commission in the clearest terms Mrs Scrivener pledged to undertake just such a study . #% Another point I want to make is that Mr Hallam seems to suggest that we might continue with this system after monetary union has been put in place . #% Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement . #% I add one footnote , but an important point of principle . #% I also thank Commission Vice-President Kinnock for his congratulations and good wishes for Ireland winning the Triple Crown , particularly after their tremendous win at Twickenham last weekend . #% One of the crucial issues to be decided is the definition of the family unit for verification purposes . #% The Council proposal containing those requirements , ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report . #% Something has to be done soon and we have to face up to it . #% We now have to go out in June to look for votes from the electorate . #% This is what will be effective in the long term . #% This has been one of the weaknesses down the years , for as long as I can remember . #% Another problem is that though the nutritional profiles that will be required by law on all products will be a step in the right direction they will fail to distinguish the quality of the fat , sugar and salt in the food or drink . #% Five different types of renewable energy have come together in one export council and that is an excellent step forward . #% The Road Safety Campaign which is being put in place includes the following matters : more speed cameras , more breath tests , a penalty point system , stricter enforcement of seat belt law . #% We need a global energy revolution towards a sustainable economic model , which provides for environmental quality to go hand in hand with economic growth , wealth creation and technological advancement . #% Minister Spring , you stated last year that WEU 's nuclear policy was unpalatable for Ireland . #% It is disproportionate and will not achieve its aims , and it will pile further red tape and bureaucracy on already struggling SMEs in most countries and particularly in my own country , Ireland . #% We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships . #% Since the setting-up of import quotas , Chinese textile exports to the EU are allowed to grow by between 8 and 12 % for the next couple of years . #% Given that it is a smaller world and that we are in a stronger position to shape it , the European Union should decide that our first objective in this new century is a world in which there is no longer any war or conflict . #% Is it contempt , or what ? #% Mobutu has already been mentioned ; we have had Amin and Bokassa . #% It is disappointing that the British Conservatives failed , among others , to support this amendment . #% In conclusion , I must stress that they have to be effectively addressed by the Turkish Government sooner rather than later , because these policy matters are an intrinsic element of accession negotiations . #% Are we to have a Commission inquiry into this , with allegations that because it gets 40 % of all investment there is something wrong ? #% Because , when we look through the history books of the 20th century and of the 21st century , terrorism and its impact -- and the human devastation it causes -- are as great today as at the start of the 20th century . #% The internal market accounts for almost one third of the Community . #% For me , coming from a small country like Ireland , it was shocking to see a Danish embassy burned and the flag of a country that has stood up for freedom and against intolerance burned in public . #% On the other hand , we have an early farm retirement scheme , which is an excellent scheme but which requires farmers who qualify to totally remove themselves from their involvement in agriculture . #% The Council position is , I believe , in the best interests of both the rail industry and the consumer . #% Mr President , the events which we are discussing today are just the tip of the iceberg . #% Some people have criticised me for saying that I want to give the EU more power in this area . #% So I have tabled amendments to that effect . #% I wish to address specifically the issue of rural development . #% Madam President , the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities . #% Take note or fail . #% Perhaps it is time to exclude agriculture altogether from the WTO because , as you said yourself , it amounts to only 5 % of world trade . #% There is time for ratification , even if we need extra time , let us take that time . #% It makes it absolutely clear that if you seriously want to do what we said in Kyoto we would do , you can not do it without a legal base or without giving yourself the competence that was given so effectively when the European Union started back in the 1950s . #% The Taliban and al-Qa ` ida have turned to drug revenues to pay for their insurgency and terror . #% Mr President , following on the Commissioner 's earlier remarks , you are very welcome to visit Ireland where our beef is grass-fed as you know . #% What if one of the partners fails to act ? #% As Mr Cashman said , huge numbers of people are now moving about and spending holidays in other Member States . #% I should also like to emphasise my support for the agriculture budget , particularly in view of the fact that we have sold the mid-term review to our farmers and they expect that commitment to be honoured . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner whether Mr McHugh , the owner of the Atlantic Dawn , has applied to use the EU-Mauritanian fisheries agreement ? #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I too should like to add my voice of congratulations to Mr Florenz and say how fortunate we are that we have a man of his ability leading this debate and to compliment him on what he has produced so far . #% 
However we can and should do more , as part of both the fisheries agreements and our overall development policy . #% Coming from a country which has its own minority language , Irish , a language which , incidentally , is very much on the increase in Dublin where there has been an explosion of all-Irish primary schools , I certainly would like to give encouragement to the line taken by the honourable Member . #% He set out a political stall where he could ; he did not answer questions he was unable to answer . #% However , outside the question regarding the effects on stocks and stocking levels , and the new rules and regulations with regard to fishing effort and everything else , there is a further layer of bureaucracy which has a direct impact on the fishermen 's ability to make a living . #% May I make a point of order before I sit down : please do something about the lifts in this House . #% Mr President , it seems to me that it is very sad that we are discussing the issue of aircraft safety so shortly after the tragic Swissair disaster off the coast of Nova Scotia 10 days ago . #% European employment strategies must be put in place in accordance with the new powers contained within the Amsterdam Treaty as well as within revised European social fund regulations . #% With serious financial losses now for many years in livestock enterprises , we can not take for granted any longer the existence of rural large-animal veterinary practices , especially in our remote areas , let alone the development of urgently needed herd-health surveillance programmes involving routine visits by practising vets . #% If we are trying to create a multinational organisation at European level , which will have public support and legitimacy , then we can not continue to proceed in ways which exclude the democratically elected representatives from important areas of policy . #% I would call on the Commission and the Council to demand that Israel take immediate steps to comply with the human rights obligations it entered into in the association agreement . #% Can it also reassure us that competition policy will not continue to undermine the legitimate efforts of regional and cohesion policies ? #% Economic reform is needed to create vibrant economies , as has been proven in a number of cases in Europe . #% Mr Wynn concentrates , of course , on control and recovery of money that is overspent , and on evaluation but , in relation to the structural funds , there is another problem . #% The protocol will be used to transfer part of the EU 's overcapacity to Chilean waters . #% I would stress that all of us in our own countries , as Mrs Waddington has said , have to get the men to recognise that children are not just the responsibility of their mothers . #% At present , one in 20 people over the age of 65 and one in five over 80 suffer from dementia . #% Then , unilaterally , the same department announced earlier this month that the scheme was closing , because the amount designated -- a mere GBP 45 million -- was already over-subscribed . #% It is equally clear that the High Representative has been ineffective in coordinating a response to the continuing security and humanitarian situation . #% Firstly , we can look at our own role - look at the legislation that we bring forward and make sure that it does not impact negatively on the employment creation and on encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within our Community . #% Incineration is not the way to deal with our waste , as landfill was not the way in the past . #% on behalf of the NI Group . - Madam President , this has been an important , and indeed passionate , discussion on this particular subject . #% Extending the scope of the directive beyond those who are suffering persecution will ultimately reduce the legitimate opportunity for protecting those in greatest need . #% As a representative of a rural constituency , I am acutely aware of the concerns expressed by farmers over the very future of farming in Ireland . #% The reason I recommend this is that when this House agreed to ratify the third generation agreement , it gave a commitment to review progress on human rights and democracy after one year . #% But small countries like Ireland simply do not have 20 years ! #% The instability within the EU institutions and the war in Kosovo have certainly not encouraged a climate of investor confidence . #% There seem to be two different sides in this Parliament . #% It is discrimination and exclusion of people who work long , long hours , people who are always on call . #% The international community was warned well in advance . #% Mr President , the Finnish Government assumes the Presidency of the European Union at a very challenging time . #% Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed . #% I make that positive point because I am going to be quite critical of the Irish Government ' s position in relation to the broad economic policy guidelines . #% I of course deplore what has happened , but we in Europe must face up to the reality and continue our development efforts to support the one million poor of the Indian sub-continent . #% Taking the liver of someone already dead for research is different but still raises huge moral/ethical questions . #% The region to which I belong retained its Objective 1 status but nevertheless it is only really Objective 1 in transition , because the amount of money received under the new Objective 1 is actually much reduced from the amount per capita under the last programme . #% In this report I am calling on the European Commission to bring forward specific proposals outlining how the charter of passenger rights in Europe can be marketed to a greater extent . #% I may have missed it in the list she gave out . #% It is overdue , it is necessary . #% I urge the Council presidency to work towards finalising this arrangement as quickly as possible . #% New employment from the enlargement or encouragement of existing small enterprises and the attraction of new industries and services to rural areas is the first priority of rural policy . #% Indeed , I wish to express my disappointment that my own country , Ireland , has a much lower target . #% We have strong bonds rooted in our respective pasts and we share many common values . #% Finally , we should be realistic in terms of targets for and timetabling of the abolition of the dangerous substances , in particular lead and lead solder , and the concerns that have been expressed by industry . #% Why was the initial draft of your reaction to the election toned down ? #% Mr President , I was disappointed with Commissioner McCreevy 's reply . #% The May 2005 ` Council of Europe Convention on the Action Against trafficking in Human Beings ' has only been ratified by nine countries , two thirds of women trafficked for prostitution come from Eastern Europe and yet , countries like the Czech Republic and Estonia have not signed the convention . #% I welcome the progress made in Dublin on strengthening cooperation between European Union countries in the fight against organized crime and international drug smuggling . #% And this at a time when European farmers ' incomes are dropping . #% I too want to thank the Commissioner for the work that she has done in this area . #% It is time for a change . #% It is a key priority of the EU to make the European Union more than a single market , a free trade zone or a currency zone . #% I do not believe that the proposals which were put forward by the European Commissioner , Mr Solbes , were particularly balanced with regard to these proposed recommendations concerning the workings of the Irish economy at this time . #% Following a letter I received yesterday , I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month . #% I agree with Mr. Vatanen that the improvement of the road users ' behaviour offers the biggest potential for cutting road accident figures . #% They are in my mind doing a disservice to the vision of Europe 's founding fathers and will , I predict , be stopped in their tracks by citizen reaction . #% Any decisions we take , even as a Parliament , apart from what the Commission and others might decide , must be scientifically grounded to ensure the credibility of CITES . #% I want to thank Mr Fourçans for his report and to refer to his report in particular as a good basis for a strategy on the whole question of the harmonization of tax in line , of course , with economic convergence in future years . #% Mr President , a lively , public , political debate on concrete issues is the basis for creating a European political space . #% I thank the President-in-Office for his very short and curt reply . #% But then what happens to the public service obligation ? #% The proposal is a consolidation and modernisation of five existing directives , as the Commissioner has told us , to form one regulation concerning the biodegradability of surfactants , which are essential substances used in detergents as catalysts to break down the surface tension of the liquid in which they are dissolved , for example oil or grease floating on top of a washing-up bowl . #% While it can be useful to discuss these matters and to tease them out , the particular timing of this report , which I accept was a long time in the pipeline , is causing an awful lot of collateral damage , which perhaps it was not intended to do . #% For example , last year he went to the Farnborough air show in the UK , paid for by British Aerospace . #% The aim here is not to finalise a project which is always evolving , but to help clarify for citizens in a meaningful way the whole complex of the documents we have produced in treaty form , the kinds of priorities that we have for the Union and the limits - because some of course also worry about the excesses of the Union . #% Society recognises marriage not on moral grounds but because it recognises on a rational basis the stability it affords society socially and economically as well as securing future generations . #% Here , the EU is not the guardian of rights , but the giver . #% 
Lest there be any misunderstanding or misrepresentation , such as today 's ill-informed letter from the UK permanent representation , let the clear message go from here today that , first and last , it is the European Parliament which has acted and continues to act as the primary guarantor of funding for the peace process in Northern Ireland . #% The crisis of confidence in the Member States will have to be overcome . #% Injuries cause the death of a quarter of a million people and result in 65 hospital admissions every year . #% Over the last 50 years , the European Convention , with the decisions of the Court , has grown and evolved to accommodate new rights , new entitlements and new freedoms that have developed with society . #% The Council of Ministers has shown time after time an attitude of obstructiveness and the saga of THERMIE II is testimony to the way in which it has not seized the opportunity to enhance renewable power . #% Another small issue I point out is that the word ` benefit ' in English , certainly under the Irish system , means different things . #% We must remember that , in comparative terms , agriculture is nearly three times as important to the Irish economy as it is to the EU as a whole . #% Water pricing policies by the year 2010 will have to provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently . #% However , that does not mean that we do not have problems in our own countries . #% It is has also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tensions and bridging the divisions between the two traditions on the island . #% It must also be made illegal for EU citizens or companies to trade in fish caught by flags-of-convenience vessels . #% If the Irish family farm is to survive within a framework of the European model , as envisaged in Agenda 2000 , greater efficiencies must be achieved through cooperation and well-planned partnerships . #% Mr President , I agree with Mr Azzolini when he says that regions which are coming out of Objective 1 must not be treated as strictly as the Commission is proposing to do . #% Their undisguised candour gives the lie to those who would deceive voters into thinking that this is a mere tidying-up exercise : it is not . #% All is very far from well . #% Mr President , I strongly agree with the proposals contained in this report . #% This Green Paper discusses the framework for reducing CO2 emissions within all sectors of our society . #% These new programmes will also enable institutions in the fields of education , training and culture to improve cooperation . #% But in so far as Mr Metten agrees on this and suggests it should continue for pre-ins , I accept that because that is what the Treaty says . #% In helping the North Korean asylum seekers , by keeping them from being returned to North Korea for imprisonment , forced labour or liquidation , we will be paying an old debt and making the right decision . #% The rest period on the vehicles , for example , is completely impractical . #% I am also convinced of the need to ban recovered vegetable oils from all feed uses . #% One of the things we need to look at is the whole advertising campaign by the alcohol industry . #% Let me make it clear : I see merit in equitable and proportionate penalties across the EU , but I am less than impressed by the fact that , so long as the fishermen of the United Kingdom were bearing the brunt of punitive action , nobody cared . #% The malpractice of many fishing activities should be taken into account because it is also an environmental crime which has long-term consequences . #% Paedophiles and evil people have made enthusiastic and skilful use of the Internet for their purposes . #% The nutritional profile will not distinguish between the bad fats that damage us and good fats necessary for health and growth , and similarly with salts and sugars . #% The introduction of the concept of national security into legislation is also a retrograde step , in particular if it is going to be used to restrict basic freedoms and especially the right of political dissent . #% But when we see a nationalist minority being treated in a way that is contemptuous of their minority status , it makes our role very difficult . #% No uniform standards for safety and discharges , no Community consultation procedure concerning power stations sited near frontiers , no clear Community provisions for the storage and transport of nuclear fuels or nuclear waste , no adequate Community system of information and monitoring in cases of nuclear malfunction . #% You must listen to the industry and when you take your decisions on anti-dumping you must listen to the Member States . #% Once again , the Council is shilly-shallying , working on a compromise version which will weaken the Commission proposal . #% I have given the example of Ireland ' s dairy industry and would ask the Commissioner to examine the implications for this sector in particular . #% Their continued freedom raises a fundamental question concerning Sinn Féin and the IRA movement : who controls the direction that this movement takes in the future ? #% If we base our discussion and our debate on the advice of our scientists , on ICES and others who insist that for conservation we must restrict fishing effort in this area , in these most sensitive spawning and nursery grounds , if we follow that line we must be absolutely consistent and restrict right through . #% I do not care whether it is America , Europe , China or Mars - world-wide is equitable . #% The approach to research through biotechnology will also give us seeds and plants with the ability to survive and produce in arid , infertile areas with above normal temperatures and shallow soils . #% As there is no means other than censuring the entire Commission , in order to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding use of public funds , I had no other option but to vote in favour . #% Cancer has become the new Black Plague . #% For that reason , the principles at the heart of it should be sent to every area of conflict . #% After all , the human cost of the deaths on building sites -- which are quite appalling -- and the injuries -- which are also quite appalling -- can not be measured by the inconvenience of having to put up a bit of scaffolding . #% The proposals that we are talking about now are a necessary step , but this step has to be taken - as my colleague from Northern Ireland has said - with great caution . #% Whether it is deliberate or through negligence , at the end of the day it makes very little difference because the damage is done . #% I would like people to know that in Ireland we will have a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty and already the EU Commission is interfering by sending out propaganda to members of the public . #% It is true that credit unions provide a very important service in that they not only offer affordable loans , but also help the poorer elements of the community -- the deprived and people on low income -- to stay out of the clutches of loan sharks . #% This means that the integrity of the team must never be compromised by actions which could be construed as having a bias towards any political party or grouping or NGO . #% In 1992 , the Canadian Government had to close the fisheries even for subsistence fishing and there is still little if any sign of improvement in the stock . #% Although the application remained frozen for those two years , Malta remains in a very strong position . #% But to look at it that way is to misunderstand the policy . #% Conscious of this , more than seven years ago I proposed the amendment , prior to the decision to abolish duty-free , that we should undertake a study . #% Mr President , the fishing industry of Northern Ireland must be defended and maintained after 2002 . #% If SMEs and especially inventors are to derive any benefit from this Community patent , what they do not want is a convoluted system which will tie them up in paperwork and red tape . #% As the Arlacchi report makes very clear , after nine years the economic and social situation in Afghanistan is extremely dire . #% Mr President , I wanted to bring up an issue which should be of great concern to this Parliament , and in particular to Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% They are autistic and there is no way to explain to them what is happening or that they can not go home . #% This should not only be for tonight : it should be looked at on an ongoing basis . #% We know so little about modern war and we are so excluded by the powers-that-be that without the commitment and professionalism of journalists we would know nothing . #% Lastly , the Council would support any initiative aimed at investigating allegations of human rights violations and the question of persons reported to have disappeared . #% But once again we are going way overboard on this matter which has been adequately dealt with in the Commission 's own proposals . #% A solution must be found to the issue of contentious parades which served to provoke the recent unrest . #% This morning I received the reply to my question , and it was the greatest fudge and cowardly reply I have ever heard from the Commission . #% I agree totally with the last speaker about the fact that a woman is being sentenced to death on 3 February . #% We welcome proposals for the convergence fund , in particular the inclusion of so-called ` statistical effect ' regions , and we hope that regions being phased out will not be left high and dry , but will find a soft financial landing . #% Given that I always like to link what we do here with what is happening in our constituencies , I am pleased to say that this survey was partly funded by the EU and I hope that its recommendations will help to improve the situation . #% I have suggested a pre-payment incentive , a bonus to reward early repayment . #% Do these new methods have an effect ? #% 
Whatever your position on patents , you must agree that the current situation , in which 25 national patent offices have no consistent approach , does not contribute to an integrated and functioning common market moving forward . #% Literally one cent , one per cent of the GDP of the European Union , and what power do we have over it ? #% At first reading of the patent directive the European Parliament called for the setting up of an ethics committee to assess all aspects of biotechnology and in particular with regard to patents . #% A lot of work has been done by the Commission and by Parliament to enable the EU to better implement its development policies . #% Let us not forget that , first and foremost , our most important role as Members of the European Parliament is as public representatives of the people . #% Furthermore , would you favour some kind of enterprise guarantee scheme , similar to what is in the UK ? #% Since forests are the main absorber of carbon , sustainable forest management is key to achieving the EU 's climate change goals . #% We must use that leverage in the interests of the Sri Lankan peoples , including the Tamil people . #% The recovery plan proposed had a number of positive elements , including a formula for setting TACs and a reduction in fishing effort . #% I believe that this threatens the peace process . #% It is a disgrace and I hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation . #% Yesterday , we saw the arrest of 95 members of the NLD and the situation in Burma has become untenable . #% It is very important in terms of the market place we find ourselves in , because the modern consumer for the public service wants quality , choice and reasonable price , and competition is the best means of ensuring that , whatever the form of ownership . #% Mr President , the news from Britain that the future of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing facility is bleak is very welcome from the Irish perspective . #% The scheme has been a huge success and I would urge other countries to follow suit immediately to deal with this scourge . #% It is wrong to imply that somehow the Irish presidency may be a failure if this issue does not go through . #% Firstly , there is our duty of care for the health and protection of EU citizens . #% Statements from Mr Jospin and Commissioner Prodi during the campaign did not help , but the responsibility for investing time and energy in the campaign lay primarily with our government , and it failed . #% The Nice Summit also took a major step forward in adopting the new social agenda . #% We do not need to put any more mud into the water . #% I congratulate the Commission on its flexibility in coming forward with this . #% We spend freely to lure the market but cut every corner in social spending . #% However , all these initiatives must be predicated on the principle of protection of civil rights and fundamental freedoms . #% I would support my colleague , Mr Ryan , who said that the banks and the financial institutions need to be looked at in this entire process , because if there were no home to put the money into perhaps they might not be so corrupt . #% We urgently need integrated regional management of the Irish Sea fishery . #% I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland . #% Let us leave this discussion to another time and just move on to the vote . #% Consequently I do not support the Commission 's approach to forestry in its rural development programme . #% We have already dealt with vibration , noise , electro-magnetic fields and now we are faced with optical radiation . #% So congratulations to everyone for their good work and cooperation and good luck to all our scientists . #% Otherwise , as a famous poet from my own city of Sligo , W.B. Yeats , once wrote : ` The centre can not hold ' . #% However , in the end I voted against the report . #% We Greens believe it is up to Morocco to decide how best to benefit from its resources in its own waters . #% I was rather set back to hear the President-in-Office make the statement that there were no proposals before the Council . #% The principle of the Stability and Growth Pact is also a logical progression from the criteria laid down in Maastricht for the Member States to comply with economic conditions for participation within the new European single currency . #% I would urge the members of the committee to sharpen their interrogating skills and we will get answers , because that is a priority . #% There is far too much unnecessary red tape involved in it and it will place a very onerous and disproportionate burden on SMEs in particular . #% From an Irish perspective I would offer the following comments . #% I do not believe we should use them without prior technical examination . #% I would just like to know where the Commission stands on this . #% Everybody knows that if you want to have an abortion in Ireland , you go to London ! #% Mr President , in view of the Commission 's response to the debate last night and , in particular , to my colleague Mr Mombaur 's point on the expiry of the Coal and Steel Treaty , the protocol attached to the Treaty of Nice and the legal uncertainty now surrounding that , I would ask the rapporteur to comment on this point . #% I would like a commitment from the Commission that it is going to abolish export refunds to third countries for slaughter . #% Looking at the detail of the resolution , we would call on the Member States which have not done so - which are abstaining - to vote ` yes ' in the General Assembly . #% I wonder why we are paying less in this agreement than in the earlier one and why we have increased the number of ships by something like 30 longliners , in addition to the freezer ships that were part of the first agreement . #% Solutions must be found to the chapters of discussion which to date have remained closed concerning the future accession of countries from central and eastern Europe . #% It was a challenging task and I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the team which I was privileged to lead and work with . #% Most dramatically - and this is something that other people should take their lead from - is that it has now imposed import bans on bluefish tuna from one of its own members , Equatorial Guinea . #% There is only one amendment , which could be withdrawn . #% This is an area where the European Union could perhaps be doing more to push the Romanian authorities to increase the pace of reform . #% What is wrong with that ? #% In addition , the impact on prices and the allocation of emission rights need further examination . #% Savings can and must be made in other areas , in particular , the common agricultural policy , including harmful agricultural export subsidies and tobacco subsidies , in order to fund Europe 's economic priorities . #% I know that the Irish presidency initiated discussions on this during its time in office and it helped to encourage the Luxembourg presidency to take on board the recommendations that this Parliament is making . #% There are clearly large gaps in our services and we have an obligation to try and close those gaps . #% Mr President-in-Office , are you satisfied with the reports that are coming from the special mediator ? #% There are more than enough competent Members of this Parliament sitting in this House to take this vote today and we should go ahead with the vote . #% Yet we find that part of the United Kingdom is sinned against not only by the British Government , but also by this Community . #% What are we actually doing in terms of the accession discussions with these countries to make our opinion abundantly clear that this is unacceptable ? #% I am fed up with this irresponsible and exploitative approach to the problems of overcapacity of EU vessels . #% All the fishermen I know are realists and they realise that it is necessary to have closed areas to protect the breeding grounds . #% However , I must say that it is simply not good enough for British authorities to allow a situation to arise whereby Irish hauliers are denied access to and use of British roads , as happened when ports were blocked last Sunday for 16 hours . #% So you will have the situation where Member States do not take seriously the management of a coast . #% But , on the contrary , the report serves to legitimise a European secret service which will inevitably infringe fundamental rights in the same way as the Echelon system . #% Instead of closing the Sellafield nuclear plant on safety , environmental and economic grounds , the British governments has agreed to the expansion of operations there . #% Elections have been held in Iraq , but there is ongoing disorder and widespread killings are taking place . #% 
The European Union should not have overriding power in the area of dictating taxation policy across the territories of the European Union . #% This latter investment will support a planting programme in Ireland of over 20 000 ha per year over the period of the plan . #% I wish our friends the ten new countries well . #% I consider that since the American Government has doubled the level of aid that it extends directly to its farmers the European Union has in fact been wrong-footed and that the policy which has led us to a reduction in our share of world markets is in fact outdated and should be reviewed . #% They know how to produce coffee ; as I said , they have been doing it for generations . #% The ' I told you so ' mentality is one I suggest we can not afford . #% This report deals with a serious issue and that is fishing under flags of convenience . #% They must be prevented from transferring their assets anywhere within the Community . #% Mr President , I would like to return to a topic that was raised once directly and once implicitly by two other colleagues . #% It is hard to believe that in the fifteen countries of the European Union as many as 7,500 lives are lost simply because people do not use seatbelts in the front seat and in the back seat . #% In last year 's annual assessment report the Commission concluded that , although a wide-ranging debate on political reforms had begun and Turkey had signed several international human rights instruments over the past year , the situation on the ground had hardly improved . #% However , there are major issues at stake here and they are of concern to me . #% On foot of your final comment , particularly with regard to what we saw happening in London recently , there did not seem to be any coordination with other Member States in the European Union . #% We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy . #% Where is their vision ? #% While I am clearing the decks on this particular matter , it is only right and proper that the House should know that when this first request came to the College of Quaestors , the College , in its varying political make-up , unanimously agreed that it was impossible to implement . #% We have lived through that in Northern Ireland : our government foolishly tolerated ` no go ' areas for their own security forces , an acceptable level of violence , political status for prisoners , secret talks , side deals , the restructuring and renaming of the police , the soft-pedalling of paramilitary organised crime , and the ultimate ignominy of the early release of terrorists under the ill-conceived Belfast Agreement . #% The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem . #% I do not support the experiment , but if it is to go ahead I recommend Ireland as the perfect control . #% This also means that we must address existing difficulties which act as an entry point for men , and particularly women , to take up jobs in the workplace , most particularly so in rural areas . #% Parliament has yet to see evidence that the legal basis for this negotiation is consistent with the Treaty of Lisbon prior to the initialling of the agreement . #% Secondly , on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures , do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system ? #% The European Union also gives EUR 15 million a year towards the International Fund for Ireland and has supported consecutive Interreg programmes dating back to the late 1980s . #% I am keen to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme will be continued under this heading post-2009 , together with the inter-university programme set up last year , which aims to develop democracy and understanding between our various countries . #% Madam President , I voted against this resolution because it goes completely in the wrong direction and totally ignores the citizens of the Member States and their rights and the rights of national parliaments which are much closer to the people than the European Parliament or the European institutions . #% I think she is well placed through her excellent report to achieve consensus in the plenary session of Parliament . #% Countering such disadvantages obviously requires serious public investment in care facilities . #% First , those who are unskilled and lack the necessary training or educational qualifications must be given new opportunities . #% For this reason , we want a strong partnership pact in both designing , drafting and implementing the new generation of programmes . #% We have proven both the Bible and this nineteenth-century encyclopaedia wrong . #% Mr President , this committee and its report have been an extremely good exercise . #% We will give them the money to do work which will help our economy and our society . #% It is no surprise to find that the United Kingdom is at the top of the class in its dedication to meeting the Commission 's demands , whereas some of those countries that speak the loudest about their commitment to the European project -- such as Spain and Germany -- are among the main defaulters . #% You are right , Mr Prime Minister , that we have now got to do some of our homework as well . #% It is like saying we will make legislation as suggested legislation , and you can do what you want afterwards . #% I suppose we could all think of hypothetical situations to illustrate the difficulties posed by the level of unemployment in the Union . #% That is the basic definition in my view of terrorism : using violence in an anti-democratic way to achieve a political objective . #% 50 % or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest . #% We are obviously dependent on the markets in Europe and elsewhere and if we do not supply the markets outside Europe , our international competitors most certainly will . #% I commend the Commission for its proposal which phases in the directive in an acceptable way and which will allow industry the necessary time to adapt to the system by not shirking our bottom-line responsibility . #% The explanatory statement also informs us that , because of the way industrial fish is stored , it is impossible to tell exactly what quantity of by-catches there is . #% I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff . #% Mr President , in light of the horrendous passenger ferry disasters which have taken place recently in the European Community , such as the Estonia and the United Kingdom cross-channel ferry tragedies , these reports are a very constructive and welcome step forward . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Mann for her work , but she has managed to make a totally technical report out of what is a rather political issue . #% In fact , that should apply to all species , not just birds . #% She and her partners are in a position to help this family by influencing Sinn Féin members , like Bob Fitzsimmons and Joe Fitzpatrick , and other people like Terry Davison , truthfully to tell the lawful authorities what they know of the horrific events in the alleyway . #% The Goldstone recommendations need to be implemented in full , and I will be tracking this issue over the coming months . #% That is not to say that we do not need safeguards to ensure that there is not exploitation and to maintain the legal certainty which my colleague , Mrs McIntosh , referred to . #% What I do believe is lacking is effective coordination in the execution of programme policies . #% We all recognise that there are millions upon millions of people in the European Union and around the world who suffer indignities every day of their lives because we have failed , not only to pass legislation , but to change society 's attitude to them . #% However , here is my question : Mr McCreevy , what is the point of a society that does not serve its people ? #% EEI businesses themselves need to become more proactive in supporting cluster initiatives and joining clusters . #% in writing . - I welcome the proposed initiative to improve healthcare for people suffering from rare diseases . #% We need a European audit of water in our Community . #% With Commissioner Mandelson 's approach at the WTO , it seems the Commission wants to rush further down this road of destruction . #% It is this type of drug-related crime which is posing a serious risk to many of our communities . #% We have to accept that Member States know their own situation best . #% Many people refer to the democratic deficit of the EU ; however ; given the concentration of media ownership throughout Europe , the greatest threat to real democracy are the media barons of the world . #% We can not allow the past to overshadow the future . #% This will clearly involve banks , the police and judicial authorities as well as the relevant EU bodies and institutions such as the European Central Bank , OLAF and Europol . #% I would also urge the government of the United States to remain fully engaged in the peace process and to press Israel on its commitment to the roadmap . #% Is this the Pauline Green today who promotes individual accountability ? #% During the British Presidency decisions will be made concerning those countries which will be included in the first wave of participants in the single currency . #% Under the current regulatory framework , European Regional Development Fund supported interventions in the housing sector , including energy efficiency , but it was reserved only for Member States acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004 . #% We are not creating a level playing field when we undermine further the precarious position of families and communities for whom the fishing industry is the sole source of local employment , while at the same time leaving unchecked the excesses of industrial fishing , particularly when we claim to be developing a policy founded on sustainable development and sound environmental protection . #% There is no point in saying that we should be spending public money merely to prop up a failing or ageing system . #% 
She lives in that area , which my son represents in the City Council . #% In no way do I want to minimise the issue of world hunger , but we need to ensure that when we put forward solutions to the problem , they actually do alleviate it . #% Farmers are not normally involved in compounding feedstuffs and when they purchased their animal feed they were not always aware of the actual protein content . #% We may regret that in the future , as it has implications , not just for food production , but also for the quality of our rural environment and landscape . #% This is also part of the process of decentralising the implementation of EU and national job creation initiatives . #% I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium . #% That has to change , and this report is a step in the right direction . #% Can I say you have added to the confusion - as if it were needed - on this particular topic and I am disappointed because we now see two completely different approaches to the same issue , which has done nothing at all to add light and not heat to the subject before us . #% Would he not agree that he should be encouraging the two governments of the Republic of Ireland and Colombia to ensure that there is no hiding place for those people who were convicted in Colombia , sent to jail , and who then absconded ? #% This is very alarming because it showed that there was much unwillingness within the Council to accept the democratic will of Parliament : it obviously hoped that if it asked us enough times it would get the answer it wanted . #% I will defend his position anywhere , on any platform or forum in Europe . #% It is up to us , in Parliament , to ensure that if this is not done at a political level in Northern Ireland , we can assist them on a legal level . #% Could you put on the record the future of the whisky industry ? #% We are debating the lessons for nuclear safety in Europe following the crisis in Japan . #% I would insist , as other speakers have , on this Parliament 's view that we also need to link changes in voting procedure to changes in legislative procedure . #% Beware of partial decoupling proposals ! #% Please arrange for that report 's immediate publication . #% We must encourage the ethos of voluntary donation , but we can not ban paid donations . #% For example , pig and poultry meat consumption at 23 million tonnes is now more than three times higher than beef consumption at 7.1 million tonnes per year . #% The British Government was found to be responsible for starting the disease , for taking inadequate steps to prevent its rapid spread and , up to very recently , to eradicate it . #% Germany announced today two huge programmes for renewable energy - photovoltaics . #% Twenty-two thousand . #% They are making huge profits and we here are benefiting from those profits . #% But when we come to think about it the amount of money is quite small - EUR 27 million over a period of six years . #% Let us look in particular at those who produce in minority languages and who , inevitably , need to have subtitles for their programmes . #% I would hope not but I would sincerely hope that the Commission and the Council will take on-board the recommendations contained in my report before adopting a more permanent protocol . #% That is why this flexibility must be there . #% There is a lot of evidence that in the past they did not discharge their responsibility , without fear or favour , in a manner which ensured that every fisherman took what he was entitled to take and every ship got its quota and no more . #% Is that what we are asking for ? #% Providing full information means that consumers have choice . #% I should like to pay tribute , in particular , to the negotiating team who accompanied me at those talks , to the successive presidencies for the work they have put in and to the Commission for a good outcome . #% May be instead of dividing ourselves into the left and the right or the free marketeers and the laissez faire or whatever , we should come together and try and bring the best practices from all those ideas into one united policy . #% I am a great believer in more carrot and less stick , particularly when it comes to environmental protection . #% Targets and limited reference points must be established which will maintain the fish stock at a high enough level that the risk of stock depletion or collapse is insignificant . #% That is why the changes that have been made by our rapporteurs for swifter action are , indeed , essential . #% The way they were conducted was no way for us to conduct such important negotiations . #% Incidentally , Ireland has also failed to implement the Part-time Workers Directive and is now seriously out of line with the rest of Europe on these issues . #% I have no doubts at all that she is committed to providing legally-based rights for people with disabilities , but her argument on not bringing forward a new draft directive is wrong . #% Luckily , where poor people live , often there is a lot of sunshine , which makes quite clearly the case for renewable energy in the developing world . #% Firstly , I would have welcomed the opportunity during the last part-session to have voted on the composition of the Commission as it was presented to us at that juncture . #% Social exclusion and inadequate income , and living in a disadvantaged or deprived area , are all factors explaining why HIV as a disease mainly affects the more deprived communities in urban Ireland . #% I come from a part of the Community where we have an ancient and very rich living language but it is at some risk . #% Who will deliver the letter to the person living alone in the extreme north-west or south-west of the Republic of Ireland ? #% We will have to take the worst of both worlds : a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy , including unemployment in our vital agrifood sector , and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports . #% It is a complex and difficult report that should impact clearly on each and every citizen , so that they can understand precisely what Parliament is trying to accomplish on their behalf . #% However , it is now possible that the local authority itself is implicated . #% The family , the role of community groups and volunteers who can provide support services and the introduction of a respite care grant for dependent older persons must form part of this health strategy . #% The EU must speak out against sanctions which amount to virtual genocide . #% You have to lead a team of Commissioners and you have to master details of administration . #% Mr President , we have had a lot of valuable debate today on issues such as CFSP , HelmsBurton , the IGC and so on - very important issues in their own right . #% It is this mentality that has lengthened waiting times for vital hospital procedures to months instead of days . #% Madam President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur for producing a very concise report which cuts through the usual verbiage that we get when we are talking about reducing unemployment . #% Now all of us who seek the truth about these kidnappings must take this issue to our national parliaments and directly challenge the national governments at home in our countries . #% I would like the Commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the EU . #% The study commissioned by the EBRD under the memorandum of understanding by Professor Surrey is the only official study and I would like to ask the Commissioner if he has actually read it . #% Ireland 's birth rate is now falling , but we delayed the trend by 20 years and , although today we are just below replacement , we still have the healthiest birth rate , the youngest workforce and the strongest economy in the EU . #% The practice of water fluoridation has blighted the health of the Irish people with conditions like skeletal fluorosis : fluoride seeks calcium , especially the bones . #% What happens if you have a single European diplomatic presence abroad ? #% Building a social Europe requires consensus-building between the social partners , not creating new impediments . #% I ask this House and all the Member States to support the initiative by Commissioner Byrne to amend our Treaties so that we at least have the same powers to deal with human disease as animal disease . #% Mr President , at a time when the Commission would appear to be bent on introducing a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen , it is encouraging to see that it has finally got something right . #% Policy-wise , I wish to ask the Council to respond today on the question of inflation policy , where we know that inflation is historically low and contained , according to our own analyses . #% But that was not necessarily the primary intention in Parliament of those who observed the fact that in a divided community cross-community grass-root development takes time and that is why we have seen a slow uptake . #% Generally , the Commission needs to be much more robust with China than it has been hitherto . #% Her presence was much appreciated and her total commitment to the whole issue of regional development is accepted . #% Though TB in humans has been rightly tackled with full force by the EU in recent times , the bovine form of the disease , which results in millions of euro of lost revenue each year , should be seriously considered as we draft TB legislation for the future . #% 
The rapporteur has made a valiant effort to achieve a consensus out of a variety of cultural experience . #% It is a fine example of the European Union offering assistance without interfering in the local political process . #% One was an amendment on the arms industries and arms exports and the other was on nuclear weapons . #% I say to the Council that , unfortunately , the EU countries ' response to victims is often to close the door . #% This is certainly going to focus the minds of those drafting this treaty over the coming months and in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference . #% Mr President , on a point of order , I also wish to associate myself with those remarks . #% If this does not happen , livestock producers across the European Union will have to cope with rising prices , volatility and uncertainty for a long time to come . #% Madam President , it is excellent that we are dealing with this European health card on a first reading . #% The appalling offer by the IRA on 8 March 2005 to shoot dead the perpetrators of this awful crime is abhorrent and barbaric and has been met with incredulity in the civilised world . #% We need to look after food production just as we are concerned about energy now . #% It is difficult to argue against the principle of equal treatment , yet this report has proven hugely contentious in this House , not just between groups , but indeed within political groups too . #% Biomass also has the added advantage of giving farmers the chance to cultivate set-aside land . #% For the poorest countries , this will require 100 % cancellation of their debts . #% That is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency . #% In order to ensure that is the case -- and I am making this appeal to the Council of Ministers -- the European Union should put in place a Commissioner , backed by a Commission department for peace and reconciliation , whose function would be to send to every area of conflict in the world not arms or soldiers , but the philosophy of European Union . #% My experience of dealing with Commission officials over a long period of years has been one of great satisfaction . #% There are also reports of summit delegates being harassed , assaults on Tunisian and international journalists , denial of entry into the country , the monitoring and blocking of certain websites , the censorship of certain documents and speeches and the prevention and disruption of meetings . #% She and Mrs Ayuso González have both expressed certain disappointment at the result , but I would say to Mrs Rothe that she should feel relief that what looked possible at one time has not come about . #% This would be more representative and could be used as a clearing house for some of the minor details and proposals . #% The only safe Sellafield is a closed Sellafield . #% But unfortunately it took quite considerable time for anything to be done on that . #% We must take advantage of the fact that we are in the European Union to do things collectively . #% The report on Malta , for example , deplores the fact that Malta is divided on the issue of membership . #% The Trade Commissioner 's positive response to the request by ACP countries for a review of contentious elements of the Economic Partnership Agreement ( EPA ) negotiations is welcome . #% The honourable Member invites me to comment on the role of the Council as legislator and in its administrative/political role . #% So while we have readjustments to make and recommendations for improvements , at the same time we do not want to overemphasise the negative aspects of our report . #% It is unfortunate that the US could not support it . #% For example , Brazil has huge concerns about the proposals because the poor and landless there will suffer if sugar production expands massively , as is predicted . #% Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states . #% The Union or its Member States account for half of all the world ' s humanitarian aid and half of all international development aid . #% But major species have also been affected . #% As rapporteur on an earlier set-aside report I asked that the rates be set each year in July at the latest to enable farmers to plan properly . #% The time frame for economic and monetary union has been set out and , as we all know , those countries who will be the first to join the EMU will be selected in 1998 on the basis of the 1997 economic statistics . #% The rule of law must be seen to prevail and be effectively policed in an impartial manner . #% In particular , I would point out that Mr Andersson has put forward a balanced proposal in his report . #% Madam President , having been present for the whole debate yesterday , I have to say that Mrs Todini did say that she was going to put down an oral amendment . #% Mr President , the proposed directive is intended to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way . #% At the same time , what do we say to the voters in Spain who voted in favour ? #% However , the challenge ahead will be to make sure that the standards in that certification are maintained . #% To avoid further economic collapse and unemployment , the EC must ensure coordinated economic policies are put in place in both areas . #% The difficult environment in which the Funds have had to operate , their role as a pump primer , the approach in giving priority to disadvantaged areas and the unique role in pioneering the joint management and delivery of cross-border programmes have all been given the recognition they deserve . #% As the European Union develops more closely , we must guarantee that the citizens of the EU support these new developments . #% As Mr Bowe said , there may be `` historical '' mining sites of interest , but we are really talking about tailing ponds which contain many dangerous substances . #% In the longer term the Commission will have to cooperate with Parliament , because Parliament is concerned to determine how agreements can best be achieved . #% Apparently the Western European Union Assembly wants to be able to contribute to the Convention on Europe to ensure that the arms industry is boosted so that it can compete with places such as the United States . #% I was with Mrs Banotti , who was canvassing in my home town yesterday . #% I welcome the Commission 's proposal of establishing codes of conduct and self-regulation , not as a soft touch , or replacement for legislation , but as a means of enabling us to respond quickly to sharp practice when it occurs faster than the law can keep up . #% Oh yes , we all get to share the downside of binding CFP regulations and quotas and restrictions , but not all get to share the upside which flows from permitted assistance . #% We have tried to address the growing problem of cyber squatting by asking the registry to run a mediation and arbitration service , either free or on a cost-recovery basis to deal with speculative and abusive registration of domain names . #% National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time . #% As my esteemed colleague Mr Hughes has said , this is a matter for Council and we should not use it as a delaying or blocking tactic . #% Legislation should , at minimum , keep up with research . #% In this context it is much better to be ultra cautious . #% We could thus try to identify the causes and trends of this terrible phenomenon and see which Member States ' best practice could be benchmarked in the other Member States . #% Releasing terrorist prisoners and seeking to buy them off with places in rigged government is exalting terrorism and not eliminating it . #% But my question is : how do we police those regimes so that the consumer can be truly satisfied that cheaper imports are subject to the same tough control as indigenous produce ? #% There is something special about Sunday as the day of rest which is common to all occupations and all locations in the western world . #% It is clear that in some of our areas and weak regions where structural funds come into play , they are at risk of being cancelled out , for example , by CAP , where it acts as a regressive factor . #% Alongside the rights there are obligations . #% I admit there is no easy solution . #% Secondly , we had a major debate in this House last year that centred among other things on the question of commissioners accepting individual and personal responsibility for the exercise of their high office . #% Perhaps then the tragedy last week in Wexford of the Turkish , Algerian and Albanian economic migrants will not have not been in vain . #% If someone is guilty of criminal activity then let the full force of the appropriate law apply . #% Given our strong record on aid , I believe we have the moral authority to put pressure on our international partners to translate their verbal pledges into money . #% We need a more permanent mechanism that can respond , year round , to the multitude of human rights crises that arise . #% The initial voluntary phase of this scheme is important and I hope that Member States would actively encourage maximum participation across sectors . #% 
Mr President , I would like to personally congratulate you on your own efforts and those of my Prime Minister Bertie Ahern with regard to the Northern Ireland peace agreement of 10 April . #% They will do so because it will ensure that fish stocks are properly preserved for future generations . #% Sadly the Christian foundations and heritage of the European Union are conspicuous by their absence from the Charter . #% The tariffs are a flagrant breach of world trade rules . #% Perhaps now is the time , after we have agreed this conciliation and brought this new piece of legislation into being , to carry out an impact assessment on how the existing legislation is working , whether it is of benefit to the workers - increasing their health and safety - and whether it is increasing employment , which is one of the original arguments behind it . #% It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage . #% However , Europe is failing to compete globally in this field and our current market share of 25 % is below what is expected . #% However , a clear regulatory framework must be put in place to secure minimum protection for investors while expanding Europe 's paltry 15 % share of total global hedge fund assets . #% Having made this point , I fully support the proposal to delete Article 4 . #% There has been an uptake of licences by French , Spanish , Portuguese and one Italian vessel . #% It means that they can not provide jobs and that small and medium-sized enterprises are held back . #% The Committee of Inquiry came up with its findings and it seems that it is these findings , which contained nothing new , which led to the resignation of the Commission . #% Over the ten years since Mr Grant 's death , UNICEF seemed to become a vehicle not for promoting children , but a political agenda focused on women 's rights , which was not the appropriate place : it was a children 's agency . #% Ireland as an agricultural country has a greater dependence than any other EU Member State on agricultural exports . #% Tragedies such as that in Wexford will continue to take place until this contradiction is seriously addressed by all Member State governments of the EU . #% As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and a draftsman of an opinion on better lawmaking , I am adamant that boosting competition via regulatory reform is the initial stimulus that Europe needs to improve productivity . #% The objective of maintaining sustainability must , most centrally , embrace the question of how we fish in the future so that we harvest our marine resources in the most environmentally favourable way . #% I have no reason to believe that will not be the case . #% Europe faces three connected challenges in this regard . #% It is completely unacceptable that European citizens and their rights to privacy are not being protected . #% In this regard , the Union must commit over the five-year term of the incoming Commission to increase border security , and to implore national governments to do more to tackle the sex trade , particularly when it involves young women who have been trafficked from another country . #% As regards enlargement , I very much welcome and support your initiative to invite representatives from the parliaments of the applicant states . #% Whatever the eventual outcome , I hope that will be a hallmark of the scheme . #% Finally , in terms of the principles I would apply to this area , safety is the first priority , environmental sustainability the second and efficiency the third . #% Peace is a prerequisite for development ; without peace all effort is wasted . #% Speaking on behalf of the Irish delegation in my group , it will come as no surprise to many that I have some difficulties with those reports dealing with research of one kind or another in the nuclear sector . #% I want to say to the Eurosceptics in this House and throughout Europe that , whether they like it or not , that decision was made in good faith . #% If one looks at Community statistics on employment in the sector , it is clear that this is on the decline . #% Aspects of EU policy such as this tarnish the image of the Union amongst its citizens and discourage people from interacting with it . #% That is a quotation directly from the Reflection Group report of the fifteen Member States , the Commission , and European Parliament . #% One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer - I realise how difficult it is for him to speak on this issue when so much depends on action being taken by other people and other institutions . #% Finally , I hope that the European Union and the United States of America can come to an agreement in Bonn in May of this year so as to guarantee that environmental targets to reduce the effects of global warming can be reached . #% This is the first piece of legislation proposed by the Commission since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol which combines pollution control with savings of EUR 1.3 billion in the annual costs of our Kyoto commitments . #% There seems to be a slight confusion here . #% Will the level of headage payments under Objective 1 be continued under Objective 1 in transition areas ? #% I am sure he will arrange for Parliament to do so in its consideration . #% The Union can take credit for the bold and innovative initiatives which it has taken over the last 10 years in order to improve the competitive performance of European economies . #% It is true that we must continue to review our standards of protection of animals during transport and each Member State must be willing to police and enforce the law . #% I would like your assurance that you will now respond to our call for research and meet as a matter of priority with the aviation industry to look at improved health warnings on tickets . #% That is the reality of the situation and it is an issue which , rightly , will not go away . #% We have done considerable research before coming to the conclusions before us tonight . #% We could increase by something like EUR 4 000 million the value of the fish landed in the European Union if we could apply a little bit more care over a period of time to our fishing activities . #% Whilst the welfare of animals being transported from one jurisdiction to the next must be of paramount importance , I do not believe the policy direction proposed by the Commission to Parliament with regard to this measure is correct . #% Will the presidency demonstrate its commitment to urban areas by arguing in favour of Parliament 's priority requiring continuation of the URBAN Community initiative ? #% To go back to the dairy sector - there are two reports here , one relating to skimmed-milk powder , the other to butter - we should remember that even though we have a quota system which is designed to bring production close to the level of consumption , we still have to spend approximately EUR 3 000 million a year disposing of surpluses , and of the skimmed-milk powder which we produce something like only 37 % of it is sold at market value . #% I use as a template for this the St Brendan 's Village project in County Mayo in the west of Ireland , and the SLE Habitat Extra Care scheme in Lille in France . #% The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates . #% We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together . #% It is never easy to broker an agreement and that is why it is taking time to enact a new European treaty . #% Mr President , can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur . #% There is much I welcome in this report and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner again . #% Commissioner , we need some clarification regarding thresholds , as Mr Harbour has indicated . #% Mr President , this is an oral amendment to replace the words ` improving compatibility of school hours with working hours ' with ` improving the compatibility of working hours with school hours ' . #% Informing citizens about this important office naturally requires time and resources , and it is true that work remains to be done in increasing the profile of the European Ombudsman . #% Your failure to endorse the conclusions of the EU/EOM and other observer groups such as ANFREL , NDI and the Commonwealth , compounds your predecessor 's mistake in failing to criticise the farcical presidential referendum and is directly responsible for encouraging the Government of Pakistan to behave as it does . #% That is why the Daphne programme is so important to us , not only because - if I could use the phrase - it was our own child , but also because we see the importance of its effect on a global scale . #% The reality is , of course , that the web provides a fantastic vehicle for change in countries that have to date suppressed freedom of expression and frustrated democracy . #% In the international arena , EU leaders rightly focused on issues such as Iraq and the future role of the UN . #% Two years before that , in 1997 , we had the Cork Declaration stating the need for a vibrant and innovative rural development policy to combat emigration from rural areas and the ensuing social problems this created in urban areas . #% This policy costs taxpayers in the region of one and a half billion euro per year , yet it has manifestly failed to deliver . #% The human rights clauses written into EU agreements with those countries should be used , where appropriate , to raise concerns on trafficking . #% Mr President , I was present at yesterday 's session but I forgot to sign in . #% Also , may I use this opportunity to express my regret about the incident in Osnabrück which happened during this conference and on a more local level at the outrageous murder of Ms Veronica Guerin by people involved in the drugs trade . #% With regard to the lifting of the embargo on arms in China , I support the rapporteur 's view that the ban should remain in place . #% It is up to the British Government to force BNFL to come up with alternative technological methods to deal with the discharge of such materials . #% 
This debate will hopefully send a strong message of support for the Lamy proposal , as the WTO General Council simultaneously discusses the subject . #% Indeed it is not without significance that though you promise us a recital in written form of some examples , you have not been able today in your substantive answer to give a single example of realistic cutting of red tape . #% Madam President , I have listened very carefully and have participated actively in many debates on the major elements of Agenda 2000 . #% It is in the interests of all contracting parties that the bottom line issues that remain outstanding are debated , resolved and finalised . #% What will it take to make us serious about this ? #% I have to remind the House that on many occasions , as Mr Wojciechowski and others have said , prevention is better than cure . #% Of course the proof is in the commitment in translating those obligations into practical policies . #% Many of these vessels have been active in the NAFO area , but that is not the only place where they operate . #% The real beneficiaries will be the big beef barons of South America and elsewhere . #% I have been in this House since 1984 , and rarely have I seen such neglect - such wilful neglect - by the European Union in dealing with a famine of this kind that we knew was on our doorstep . #% But , regrettably , this is not always the case . #% I do not believe that this square can be circled . #% This is a criticism I would level against those in particular who propose putting into effect complete federal structures within the European Union . #% Secondly , I would like to ask the Commission whether it would undertake through its 2005 work programme an initiative to establish a missing children website in all European Union Member States ? #% In particular for the middle-income countries , the mobilisation of domestic revenue is crucial for reducing poverty and aid dependency . #% He would like to make it clear that he supports the aim of the Council Decision , as we are in favour of better exchange of information , and recognise the benefits Europol brings to Member States regarding law enforcement and crime fighting . #% In Northern Ireland we are going through a grave crisis . #% The Irish Government really needs to get its act together . #% We are not factored into this report , yet we need to be protected because we have Sellafield , a British reprocessing plant , very close to our shores . #% The role of the United Nations in conflict situations around the globe provides us with many examples from which we can learn and build upon to define the EU peacekeeping role . #% Will it be fleet by fleet or by quota allocation ? #% If Member States which persist with nuclear generation want to reassure their neighbours , they must give full access to information to the appropriate authorities in those neighbouring states . #% If we are to reap the real and tangible benefits from new and evolving information technologies we need to invest in the re-organisation of companies and in our administrative structures . #% Road transport will continue to be the dominant mode of transport for Member States for which alternative modes are not possible and not realistic . #% That is the wrong signal to send out . #% So while this is a very small and modest programme , it is at least something to recognize and draw to people 's attention the need to protect above all the pleasures of curling up with a good book . #% More focus must be put upon controlling the gases that have already been produced . #% It makes no sense to have barriers to free movement , but I hope that the final directive gets the balance right between allowing and encouraging the free movement of health care professionals , plus automatic recognition of rights for more than 50 categories of medical specialist -- in particular much-needed cancer specialists , and continuing to safeguard patient health and safety . #% Secondly , in relation to my immunity : Does that not count when I am in another country ? #% Bi-partisanship in both the British and Irish Parliaments has been fundamental to the continuation of the Irish peace process , particularly when there were difficulties . #% Only now is there a chance for them to develop and prosper . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , I welcome the opportunity to have this debate . #% However , over the week-end the British Government advised people to hoard food because of the year 2000 . #% He never does have an easy task , given that the implications of energy spread across several committees . #% They must , for example , in the case of my country , be adequate in terms of the level and duration of funding in order to address our continuing significant development needs . #% author . - Mr President , I support this resolution even though I think it is not critical enough of the Sri Lankan Government . #% There is no evidence that the problems with it , such as they are , would warrant a large intrusion into the domestic tax arrangements as contemplated by this Commission communication . #% However , this time round it touches on some of the very important general issues but leaves open the possibility that case by case , sector by sector , we can carry the analysis forward as appropriate , and we welcome that . #% author . - Mr President , the policy pursued towards the Tamil people by the Government of President Rajapaksa has resulted in a nightmare for both the Sinhala and Tamil peoples in Sri Lanka , with massive repression by the Sri Lankan state against individuals and groups who have stood up against its chauvinist policies . #% Last week 's report indicated that three countries -- Ireland , Spain and Italy -- accounted for almost half of the five hundred infringements of environmental laws in the European Union over the last five years . #% I fear that it is the latter , especially if it offers a system which multiplies opt-outs and potential fragmentation rather than unity of purpose . #% Can we not get together and find a way of dealing with stem research without experimenting directly on human beings ? #% Misinterpretation , purposely or otherwise , of the Rules of Procedure of this Parliament has been used to delay it even further , and literally because somebody is a candidate in an election , or forthcoming election , in France , this is being used as a stick with which to beat them . #% And the most important thing to remember is that when you go into a peace process you have to make peace with your enemies , not with your friends , and that can create a lot of internal difficulties . #% The second main area of success was undoubtedly EMU . #% I should like to list , for the record of the House , the active cases I am working on at the moment . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner if he could expand on the remark he made on the Council taking decisions regarding investment in state -- owned companies . #% A former Nuremberg prosecutor , Benjamin B. Ferencz , said : ` There can be no peace without justice , no justice without law , no meaningful law without a Court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstance . ' #% Renewable energy interests European citizens . #% Our cars are all imported , contributing nothing to employment and adversely affecting our balance of payments . #% I commend all three rapporteurs for their work on this important subject . #% In the context of poverty reduction , what progress is the Commission making in tackling corruption ? #% Mr President , I want to acknowledge the important role of the Court of Auditors in preparing these reports . #% On 30 January , their brother Robert was murdered by members of the Irish Republican Army in Belfast . #% Mr President , I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this own-initiative report by Mr Agnoletto on the human rights and democracy clause in EU agreements . #% Mr President , I should also like to welcome the comments from the Commissioner and , in particular , from the two rapporteurs . #% We are not trying to impose our will on any sovereign state , but we will tell them that there is a price to pay . #% Countries representing half the population of Europe have said yes . #% How can Europe respond ? #% Only the Israeli authorities have the means to eliminate the substantial distortions of the origin rules involving settlement products without causing further inconvenience to the EU , the Member States , Community operators and Israeli exporters . #% It may well not be the time or place to speak in Irish , but I do not think that derogatory and disparaging remarks about anyone 's language , albeit a minority language , have any place in this House and I take exception to them . #% There are many areas where that can be shown to have been the case . #% We can not allow a situation to develop in which , as one economist was quoted today as saying , ` the Services Directive could end up as a good example of `` death by Parliament ''' . #% Action on that is imperative . #% In voting against the resolution I again stand on the side of the citizen who wants less not more Europe , states rights not Brussels control , and local not central power . #% We must also ensure that there is full and proper application of all aspects of maritime safety regulations in order to afford maximum protection for all those working in the sector , as well as to protect properly inhabitants of coastal areas and the coastal environment . #%
