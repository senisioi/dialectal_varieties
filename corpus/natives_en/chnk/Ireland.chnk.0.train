Of course , first and foremost , we have a social obligation and social concern for the most vulnerable within our society . #% Unless we in the European Union actually ensure that these kinds of measures are protected , we can not push for any other oppressive legislation . #% Building a stronger democratic structure must be a key aspect of development efforts . #% It is understandable that Palestinians feel that right would have been on their side in formerly declaring an independent Palestinian state on 13 September . #% The effect on prices during the recent dairy crisis is just one example . #% Mr President , as you can hear , we have a huge clash here between ethical and moral considerations of many religions and cultures and the ambitions of the pharmaceutical industries to secure their position in global markets . #% We want evidence that you can listen and understand what your role is , what our role is and what the roles of of the Council of Ministers , of lobbyists and of members of the directorates-general are . #% I would ask that we all do that . #% In addition , as well as the rightful emphasis on biodegradability of surfactants , I welcome the change in the review clause in the compromise package to give priority to exploring possible needs for phosphates legislation within three years rather than five . #% I particularly welcome that he wants to include the social partners and the trade unions in this . #% The policy of withdrawing fish from the market and sometimes destroying it simply because the price is too low is totally unacceptable . #% It is in the interests of all those countries which support a strong agricultural policy , be they existing or future Member States , to see the fastest possible integration into the common agricultural policy . #% In recent weeks we have heard much talk about a review of the agricultural budget which was agreed in Berlin only a few months ago . #% It concerns the last two paragraphs . #% I hope that the next time that you come back to this chamber you will not respond in the same curt fashion that you did to Mr Newton Dunn , if the presidency wants to work with Parliament . #% One of the issues that must be addressed if we are to ensure that women - and in particular working women - can participate and that they get time off work in order to pursue trade union activities , is that of employers being extremely reluctant to allow workers to have time off to pursue either training or trade union activities . #% With the tragedy of FMD following on from BSE and swine fever we must review in a rational way the common agricultural policy . #% Over 120 women have been murdered since 1996 , a significant number by a partner or ex-partner . #% No matter how much Mr Prodi protests , he and his college are seriously flawed . #% Secondly , as the President-in-Office is so much in favour of the idea of concerted effort and concerted action at European level , could we have a commitment from the President-in-Office that the monies which are presently in a bank account in Brussels and are to be allocated to the Irish naval service for the upgrading of equipment and for the provision of extra ships be released as soon as possible to enable the Irish naval service , which in effect is the western wing of any European coastguard service , to protect that large area against the illegal importation of drugs . #% REACH will make it easier to develop and market new and safer substances and it will greatly reassure European consumers as manufacturers , producers and importers register chemicals and supply information about their properties . #% The necessary police and judicial cooperation must be forthcoming at European level , and urgently so . #% That is why I am not concerned in the least by the 10 % or the 25 % . #% These architects were seen by the competent authorities in their Member States as having sufficient acquired experience and ability to be allowed to practice as de facto architects . #% But we are in danger of overplaying our hand . #% This is not just to do with the fact of people being denied the right to asylum , but it has to do with how they are treated afterwards . #% Mr President , they say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish . #% However , we need to take initiatives both nationally and at European level to counteract the inevitable negative impacts on these reforms . #% If you are trying to keep the link between Parliament , Commission , Council and the people , you must try hard to get a quick solution to this . #% We tabled an amendment on how Member States get round the multiannual guidance programme by transferring their vessels to third countries and by using flags of convenience . #% It seems a long time ago , but it still remains in our memories . #% None of our citizens knew how that decision was made . #% We need to create trust but , until these new systems are in place , there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line as they do offline . #% I feel we need a well-established recycling mentality before moving on in any direction . #% There is too much criticism of EU regulation and the onus is on us legislators to demonstrate the host of valuable measures that have originated here which improve the status and condition of women . #% Everyone recognises that there is a problem in the Irish Box and that there is a problem with stocks . #% We were proud to do so then and I am proud today after your record in office of two and a half years . #% It will be seen for what it surely will be : a crusade by the West against Islam . #% I myself was absent , but I have had this confirmed to me . #% Recently , the Commission put forward a package of proposals which , amongst other things , called for a reform of the CAP , the Structural Funds and the entire budgetary policy of the Union . #% I say to the President of the Council that his statement embarrasses me , and if it does that to me it must surely embarrass our colleague , Mr Haarder , who we all have known and respected as a man of principle and integrity since his time in this House . #% Now , both the European and Canadian transnational corporations want to break into the provision of public services in Canada - on a maximisation-of-profit basis , of course . #% I am wondering whether this is entirely necessary , because all we are looking for there is for aid to the government to be suspended , not aid to NGOs , for humanitarian reasons . #% But , obviously , Mr Rothley is still dealing with his onerous task of the Statute for Members and so on . #% Under the economic governance package , Member States will have to be more transparent with their own budgets . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% This has to be taken into account . #% That was and , in many cases still is , the system . #% This will not go down well in the individual Member States . #% Established in 1994 , the agreement permits Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU 's single market without conventional EU membership . #% The van Velzen report emphasizes the importance of sustainability , which is not a strong enough focus of the Commission proposals . #% For agriculture as a whole - $ 49.8 billion in 2006 - the Court found a marked reduction in the estimated overall level of error . #% The Socialist Group has put forward an amendment asking for a framework directive ensuring that in sectors like energy services of general interest are protected . #% All people should be entitled to their full social , economic and cultural equality . #% But I want to point out to you that in the three sample cod catches on the west coast of Ireland , 98 % of the cod caught in the nets was either destroyed or severely damaged by the seals . #% There is also a public confidence crisis . #% Nuclear materials are currently clearly not secure and not safe . #% Now , you made a comment during your remarks and maybe you will reply or enlarge on it : you said that eggs from outside the EU not meeting equivalent standards would have a different mark . #% It is my view that no Commissioner , from MacSharry to the present Commissioner Fischler - and I include as well Commission officials - would deliberately embark on a campaign to endanger public health . #% I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at European Union level . #% This is why I am quite keen on the idea of the European Rail Agency proposed in the Savary report , because there are a lot of other aspects in this rail debate which need to be addressed , both in terms of the commercial life of Europe , but also its spatial development and the development of cohesion . #% We must explore the possibility of additional farm production to manufacture products separately for the growing world market without export refund or other cost to the EU budget . #% I wish to say to Professor Prodi , if he uses his stubbornness in this Parliament as a reliable partner for Europe , that is the kind of stubbornness we welcome . #% At an informal Council of Social Affairs Ministers on 10-12 July in Dublin the general issue of social protection and long-term unemployment was discussed with particular reference to making social protection systems more effective in helping the most disadvantaged members of society to gain access to employment . #% One is environmental : the health of the seas . #% Obviously this most recent war has brought home to us the horrors of conflict and the toll that it takes on human populations and human infrastructure . #% 
In general I feel this resolution points in the wrong direction . #% Apart from that , it has largely been a failure . #% For example , I know that the Commission is required to keep Parliament informed of the enlargement negotiations to enable it to express its views in good time through appropriate parliamentary procedures . #% I was interested to hear what Commissioner Van Den Broek said about the VAT situation being much clearer here , but , as the Commissioner is aware , there were other problems associated with some small industries and so on . #% Unfortunately , those gangsters have been replaced by other younger and even more vicious criminals . #% Again my thanks go to the rapporteur and to all colleagues for their particular understanding . #% Mr President , we should remind colleagues who may not be here for the formal sitting that the vote on the calendar for next year takes place at 12.30 p.m. , so everybody should be back and not caught offside . #% It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament . #% It is they who have the right to expect that their interests are represented wholeheartedly . #% One of these problems is how we dispose of our waste . #% You had more money at your disposal than anyone in Irish history , yet the Irish health system remained an under-funded disgrace , with long waiting lists for the simplest operations and patients crammed into hospital hallways every weekend . #% I did have some problems with the text as adopted by the Fisheries Committee . #% These proposals could have a serious effect on tourist earnings from angling , and also have a negative cultural impact on many parts of Ireland . #% Mr President , there are occasions when words are meaningless and when failure to act undermines the credibility of what we say . #% EU alleges Israel was spy . ' #% It is impossible to operate . #% We rely on the Commissioner to make strong representations to the Chinese Government on the specific concerns raised in this resolution and , indeed , in former recommendations of Parliament , in particular in relation to the Pan Am project and Parliament 's view on the funding of that project . #% This is important . #% The main feature of the Commission proposal is to ensure that Member States set a minimum level of oil stocks for a period of 120 days . #% It is not equal treatment when there is such a huge difference in the proportion of funding received by one organisation as compared to that granted to other women 's organisations . #% In Europe , 16 % of citizens still live below the poverty line . #% Mr President , whether one accepts Mrs Lucas 's figure of 4.1 million jobs or the Association of European Airlines ' figure of 7.5 million jobs directly dependent on air transport , we must agree that the aviation industry contributes very significantly to European employment and growth . #% I would like a clear answer from the Commission as to why it is failing to do what this Parliament has asked it to do and what it was instructed to do by the Council at the spring summit , because this is not acceptable . #% Finally , given the well-publicised claim by members of your government that Ireland is closer to Boston than Berlin -- a claim from which I dissociate myself -- could you at least turn that now to an advantage with your plans to re-establish close transatlantic links given the rift that has ensued following the invasion of Iraq ? #% in writing . - I voted to support the 2007 discharge for the European Commission , but I did so with some reservations . #% As we know , many new plant varieties patented by biotech companies are based on traditional wisdom handed down through the generations , and now farmers are being asked to pay for these patents . #% However it is with some concern that I see that they have changed the common position in particular . #% First of all we thought we would have a proper resolution and then an oral question ; in fact a great many Members signed an oral question . #% Mr President , while the resolution is correct and proper , it has omitted to include Ireland . #% Equally , it remains the preserve of the 15 Member States of the EU to maintain law and order within their own countries while safeguarding their internal security . #% I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world . #% It is also important that we learn from mistakes made in the programmes in the past . #% in writing . - The European Parliament can not give its consent to the introduction of body scanners , which are essentially a type of X-ray , before the existing health and privacy concerns surrounding them have been properly addressed by European authorities . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Nicholson for his report , and for the speed with which he researched and did the work . #% Given the fact that there have been over twenty deaths and almost one thousand recorded cases of the disease in Hong Kong , it is appropriate that the report should refer to this problem . #% The Daphne programme has been an important instrument in helping to raise awareness of and to combat violence against women , children and young people . #% It is perfectly legitimate to link financial incentives to human rights and democracy questions through our funding of key projects . #% Regrettably , our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs , cigarettes and human beings . #% So why do we need a common approach ? #% Establishing safety and confidence when we are faced with cyber-crime is another area which calls for a collective response on a global scale , given the world-wide dimension of the Internet . #% It is true that we talk the talk of human rights , but too often , it seems to me , we hold back when there are economic interests which we seem to hold dearer . #% None of the other minor food-producing species I have mentioned exhibit similar features as the length of the life span , sections of the industry not being oriented towards food production , high monetary value of individual animals and the recreational and sentimental value . #% We must accept the difficulties that we are facing ; the scientific evidence is now overwhelming . #% We have to try and overcome the idea that there is one true faith , one true version of history and one version of truth expounded by the chosen ones . #% I have no doubt that you will carry out your responsibilities with efficiency . #% The Commissioner also said that he had negotiated alongside Commissioner Fischer Boel in Geneva last week . #% These arguments and this debate are predicated not on real divergence of opinion with regard to a better form of social model , but merely on maintaining an archaic , protectionist system . #% In answer to Mr Giansily , the Commissioner clearly remarked that at this point he was not willing to decide the actual passage to the single currency because that is for next year . #% Each Member States has different needs because rural areas differ right across the 25 Member States . #% It is important to recognise that DAPHNE has been one of the most successful European projects . #% Member States have had sufficient warnings . #% We , as legislators , have a responsibility to ensure that we bring the people with us and keep in touch with their everyday concerns #% Events have taken place over the last 10 days which have led to serious instability in Northern Ireland and have placed in peril the substantial achievements of the peace process over the last two years . #% There has been a lot of debate -- indeed , dispute -- in this House about how Romania is caring for its most vulnerable children and young adults with handicaps . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner to the House . #% This report recognises that the challenges we face can not be addressed by reheated dogmas , whether of the left or the right . #% It is totally wrong that an opt-out is available on health and safety law , and important that it is ended as soon as possible . #% The regulation combines advances in European manufacturing and technology and increased levels of safety protection that the European consumer can expect . #% This legislation will reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed by pesticides and is aimed at halving the quantities used within a decade . #% I would criticise Mrs Harney for so doing , if , as was said , she did that at a time in the process when consultations should have been taking place . #% Parliament 's role must be a constructive one . #% At that time , the Commission promised that liability for environmental damage caused by GMOs would be covered by horizontal legislation , but we have been waiting for more than 10 years for that promise to be fulfilled . #% Ireland is a net importer and 75 % to 80 % of our packaging is imported . #% Parliament fought for many years to get it and it is now enshrined in the Treaty . #% If I am blind in Ireland , I am blind in Europe . ' #% The Commission staff should cease empire-building and behave collectively for the good of the Community . #% 
As we work through the process of formulating a European mental health strategy , the most important question we should ask ourselves is : will this make someone 's life better ? #% Some of the trucks from my country have been held up into the second week . #% In this latter regard , I welcome the fact that since the Israeli forces left southern Lebanon , the region has been very peaceful . #% This is a new low and I am sure I speak for all Members in condemning this atrocity . #% I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mrs Wulf-Mathies for being the visible face of the European Community in Northern Ireland and I want to say that I hope we can continue with the assistance we are giving which has meant so much . #% Elsewhere the Presidency commends the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the observer mission for assuring a widely secure and free election day . #% Paramilitary groups are a result of clandestine military strategy , and that has to be taken into account . #% The explanation must be available , it must be clear and it must be transmitted by a willing media . #% Commissioner , you will probably be familiar with the resolution that is before you . #% We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services . #% I am a little upset and worried about his talk of rapid reaction and the refusal of a political infusion into ECHO . #% My final point is in relation to bioterrorism . #% It has had to bed down the peace process and make it worthwhile for people to abandon their support for paramilitary organisations and to engage in constructive and proactive work , both north and south , across the border and in border areas . #% An honest assessment of the committee 's work to date would give a mixed picture , I believe . #% Therefore , it is essential for us now to come up with a balanced approach as to how best protect the intellectual property rights of the creators . #% Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to the worsening situation in Darfur . #% It is very important that passengers are fully informed as to what they should do to guarantee that deep-vein thrombosis will not develop . #% Until now , his government has not seemed to bother about serious infringement . #% Finally , I know that time is up but I wish to make two short points . #% I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament . #% Mr Prodi has said that it is not simply an assembly of disparate ideas and indeed he has offered some priorities here . #% Israel claims that its invasion of Jenin and other areas was an attempt to destroy the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure . #% But in welcoming the decision as we do , we insist that those modernising forces must make determined progress towards European norms of respect for human rights and of the relationship between civil and military society ; towards the abolition of the death penalty ; towards a clear respect for minorities , especially the Kurdish minority in Turkey . #% We want competitive handicap to be addressed where it is a genuine problem but not to be used as an excuse for going soft on necessary change . #% We find it very one-sided and a blatant demand for Morocco to give in to European demands regardless of what it wants . #% To say this is to use a sort of accountancy jargon that puts the whole issue beyond the understanding of the ordinary European citizen . #% They have always been cooperative and competent and they would often have liked to go much further and do much more than they were allowed to do . #% It should have requested at the very least that the UK dissociate itself from the management of the Echelon system and it should also have asked Germany to close down the interception base which is located on its territory . #% Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where schooling is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife . #% The issue of social exclusion is a matter to which the presidency attaches a high priority . #% The Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative achieved moderate success in tackling debt relief for the 42 poorest countries in the world , but this was only an initial effort by the developed world to tackle the problem of debt relief itself . #% Mr President , this was the first time I had taken part in one of these delegations . #% Sometimes you could be forgiven for getting the impression that economic and social cohesion is a flanking policy . #% It is not in anybody 's interest , particularly in Ireland , with our greater dependence on agricultural exports , that the basic infrastructure of the food sector - the family farm - is in such dire straits . #% We managed to find 2 billion extra when the beef industry got into trouble even though the pig meat sector is twice as big - there is twice as much pigmeat consumed in the European Union as there is beef . #% So there is a very large market to be satisfied . #% In the longer term , Eastern and Central European countries seeking to join the European Union will want to participate in the single European currency system . #% Such a document would ensure that a set of internationally agreed objectives be drawn up in close cooperation with other countries , most notably the United States of America , and would encourage simplified regulatory governance of the Internet . #% In fact , we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established . #% Therefore , a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector . #% Issues that we have addressed together range from improving security in airlines to the issue of mutual extradition agreements . #% Unfortunately , the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs goes totally against the spirit of co-operation achieved up to now . #% I appeal for the stakeholders in the industry to be consulted in a meaningful way , not with platitudes . #% The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment . #% We need industry to buy into what we are saying . #% The Council has just reached a political agreement on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organization in the Member States of the EU . #% That is why it is unfortunate that some of the brilliant ideas from the Presidency on the future it envisages for the European Union have not been taken up properly . #% There is just one point I would like to make , and that is the greater need for transparency in our financial institutions , be it at regional , national or EU level . #% The main costs of the crisis have so far been borne by taxpayers . #% The reason is that I am very angry at the statement issued by the Presidency concerning the election and I regret that the same sentiments were expressed today . #% It is clearly stated in Article 176 that no stricter measures can be taken by a Member State unless they are compatible with the Treaty , i.e. unless they are proportionate , non-discriminatory and do not create unjustified barriers to the single market . #% The NII would like to see the minimisation of the amount of high-level liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential hazard . #% However , the fact that EU leaders were able to agree a reform of the decision-making procedures within the EU institutions at Nice before Christmas is certainly a step in the right direction . #% The amendment related to Budget line A-3015 which is used to finance the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages . #% So it is not that people are disconnected from concerns about the world , but they certainly do not necessarily see any relevance in being asked to vote for the European Parliament , or indeed in some cases for national parliaments . #% I can not understand why blood from a remunerated source must necessarily be banned in Europe . #% As well as that , as President Barroso rightly mentioned himself , despite high employment participation levels in many countries in recent years , many people with disabilities , and 74 % in total , were unemployed , despite the fact that they had access to education and training , because of the psychological barriers and blockage that existed . #% It is somewhat ironic that it is the US that is taking the lead on this issue despite the historic links and relationship between Britain , Burma and its people . #% As many of my colleagues have mentioned , tourism is a very important industry . #% Dependency on any single resource leads to market vulnerability . #% Violence has only resulted in an intensification of hatred and recriminations between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples . #% The Irish presidency is also letting down the Irish public , which views this matter as an absolute scandal . #% Colleagues , when you introduce moral issues into the process of money-making , it is never welcomed by those making money . #% I would particularly like to mention the category issue here which I suppose effectively means getting back to the first reading position on this . #% But take the broad guidelines on fiscal and monetary policy : it is not only a question of style , but of substance . #% The members of the Académie française could immortalise this word by putting it in the dictionary . #% 
We must build a European Union that commands the good will and support and enthusiasm of the 370 million citizens who make up the membership of the Union . #% It is wrong to include antibiotics in food . #% Rather , we must promote as normal for all Member States the tax regimes which have been shown to be successful . #% Switzerland is the only European country to take part in these programmes without being a member of the EEA , a candidate or a potential candidate country . #% To get through that few questions is really quite an appalling reflection on the House and the system . #% The final plan for the liberalization of gas markets in Europe will be put in place before the end of the Irish presidency of the EU this year . #% I thought that maybe Mr Corbett , drawing on the experience of his own party back in the United Kingdom , was going to suggest that we could fund this endeavour by creating an upper House and then selling the membership to the highest bidder , it would not be totally out of place with some of the things that go on in this place . #% It is worth noting that , unlike competing global positioning systems -- notably American ones -- our Galileo project has been used exclusively for civilian purposes . #% Although it is a free vote , I will be recommending that we vote against , in the hope that a compromise will be found in that area . #% And I would suggest that the EU should only import food produced under the standards it demands of its own producers , and not accept lower standards in relation to animal welfare , food safety and the environment . #% Obviously I would very much like to see it in non-Union countries as well , where we experience very considerable difficulties , in particular in the North African countries , when children are abducted . #% The level of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe is still a barrier to job creation . #% It has now been revealed that the British Government , Blair and company , told lies to justify backing the American and British invasion and occupation . #% It is growing in reach and is affecting young girls and women in particular . #% The issue , for example , of renationalization of the common agricultural policy , on the basis that such a development is implied by a process of simplification of the common agricultural policy , means in effect its dismantlement , and certainly would not be acceptable . #% Improved security is not a cheap exercise and one of the issues that has to be addressed at the conciliation stage is agreeing exactly who is going to foot the bill for the implementation of the new anti-terrorist security arrangements . #% The general took over in a coup . #% Cadmium pollution of the environment carries very high health and economic costs , including water purification costs . #% The measures we are dealing with today aim at the effective protection of European waters against the risk of accidents at sea and marine pollution . #% I would like to ask people to support Mr Hudghton 's amendments , which would actually bring the regulation back to what he originally wanted . #% Mr President , the fisheries industry in crisis - we have heard it all before . #% Obviously , serious reforms are needed and will have to be pursued . #% Also , the basis on which we make resources available particularly to the poorer regions is not always very clear , either to ourselves who proposed the regulations or to the Member States who have the responsibility of interpreting them . #% After considered deliberation , I have come to the firm conclusion that the only logical and legally watertight option in the spirit of the aims and scopes of the regulation -- I would advise colleagues and others interested to read the recitals -- is to opt for a single legal base that corresponds to the preponderant purpose or the ` centre of gravity ' of the legislation . #% I also think that the very fact that this initiative is being suggested is an explicit recognition that we have failed so far in our journey towards equality . #% In relation to Georgia I do not believe the Council has considered the situation there in the recent past but I will discuss the matter with my colleagues and will communicate with the honourable Member . #% Mr President , I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% If we are not to have a conflict between science and society , which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid , we will need to revise these priorities . #% We have to recognize this as a cultural service that we must protect and support . #% The United States should not be allowed to force this to be changed . #% This request is also being made on behalf of the other Members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party . #% This is what we are trying to achieve in these compromises . #% This will be achieved by setting specific objectives to be integrated into National Action Plans and to implement policies to promote equal opportunities . #% A reformed CFP should do away with centralised overregulation from Brussels and instead focus on ideas such as how stakeholders can deal with the day to day management of stocks locally . #% Will the Commissioner disassociate herself from those comments ? #% One of the most important issues to come out of the Convention discussions has been the reiteration of the doctrine of conferral . #% I would ask you , Mr President , to respond to the e-mail I sent to your office at the end of July concerning this issue . #% The Guardian also reports that the German Government has promised Miss McAliskey that , if extradited , she would be able to take her child with her . #% Where errors are identified these mainly relate to weaknesses in internal control systems both in the Member States and in the Commission . #% Whatever we do , we must not penalise those who most need our aid , money and assistance . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado for his hard work but also for his astuteness in picking a subject of paramount importance and for approaching his work in a spirit of scientific and technological inquiry . #% I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the significant contribution of women to the work of voluntary community organisations . #% If a small operator were part of a consortium , it would have a greater chance of continued work . #% We support the position of the World Medical Association , the Committee of European Physicians , in opposing the patenting of human genes without any exception . ' #% Mr President , there is no doubt that the whole of the European Union stands together with the people of the United States in utterly and totally condemning those who carried out those terrible atrocities in the United States and in expressing our deepest sympathy to the families who lost their loved ones in these terrible atrocities . #% We must give every cooperation to Europol and do everything we can to prevent this drug abuse . #% It is also a fact that the so-called IRA is the most active and politically driven perpetrator of violence and intimidation in Northern Ireland , that it engages in widespread criminality in Northern Ireland , in the Republic of Ireland and also in Britain and does so to enforce its rule of law and to fund its activities . #% But we should not impose on those who are ready by that time the burden and failures of those who may not be and therefore we must still cleave to this notion of differentiation as the leitmotif through which we should analyse the outcomes . #% Energy , however , is not like other goods or services . #% We can look forward to working closely with those involved in the social economy sector across the Union and to further developing the social economy . #% Consumer confidence in banks is of paramount importance . #% Is that in order ? #% This is his second attempt to reach a compromise on the Consumer Credit Directive , Parliament having opposed many aspects of the proposed directive and referred it back to committee in November 2003 . #% The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real . #% Governments must remember the message from the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty , which is that the general public , acting through the ballot box , are the ultimate decision-makers on the pace and extent of European integration in all policy areas , including monetary policy . #% They can now put their words into action . #% If the malpractice of torture is not challenged and reversed , then international laws designed to protect all humanity will be permanently degraded . #% But what should we do ? #% I can assure all Members of this House that we in Ireland will vigorously pursue every political , legal and diplomatic option open to us to force the British government to close the Sellafield nuclear plant . #% If the concern is to guarantee minimum human rights , then the apparatus already exists under the European Convention on Human Rights at its Court in this city . #% On the other hand , I would like to draw attention to a point made by Mr Mulder in his report on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development : he points out that , with an eye to Project 2000 , we can not expect to finance the enlargement of the European Union out of shavings off agricultural spending . #% Medical practitioners in this area consequently predict that there will be a steady rise in the frequency of asbestos-linked cancers until the year 2020 . #% Yet Taiwan 's progress in joining the world 's community in other spheres is blighted by the People 's Republic of China . #% In my own country , Ireland , there is no legal local anaesthetic to use on cattle at this point in time . #% New ways to monitor fishing vessels could be used , such as electronic logbooks and the use of CCTV on the perimeter of fishing vessels , which has been piloted in Canada and New Zealand with some success . #% We need to clarify a number of things such as the role of EU non-NATO members in such a force and the role of non-EU NATO members in respect of such a force if they wish to participate . #% 
The Geneva Conventions must be respected by all sides . #% I ask this , not as a Member of this Parliament , but rather as a mother who can not imagine the pain this courageous family is going through . #% In particular , I believe that safety has to override all other considerations . #% The only light at the end of the tunnel as regards my own country , Ireland , is that our Law Reform Commission announced yesterday - and I suspect it is because they saw something coming down the line from the Commissioner - that they were going to make that part of their research programme for the next year . #% I would also like to take the opportunity to refute the untrue allegation made by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington that the EU/EOM leaked an interim briefing report . #% However , we in the European Union must be central to this . #% But it can not be if we stand by and pay lip service to a despot like Mugabe , who is not only destroying his country and his people , but ensuring that the aid that is given does not even reach those who really need it . #% There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date . #% In my view the death of Robert McCartney was not in any way politically motivated . #% Given Ireland 's geographical circumstances , aviation is a critical element of our infrastructure , with air services being of vital importance for economic and social reasons . #% Under UN Resolution 1373 it is incumbent on us all to ensure that those involved in perpetrating such vile acts of terrorism in America last September are brought to justice . #% The maximum penalty of not less than eight years should apply in the case of child pornography and aiding and abetting such crimes , including the exploitation of children , when they involve a child below the age of 16 . #% There have been some advances , such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation , in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential . #% Indeed we look forward to getting down to serious and immediate work on questions such as East Timor , south-eastern Europe and the Balkans in particular . #% Mr President , the key point that Mr Andersson made in his contribution tonight is the need to get the social and financial concerns in balance . #% Mr President , could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single currency , combined with better competition in the marketplace , has resulted in a substantial reduction in interest for those on variable rate mortgages . #% Europe is not a country , it is a continent and therefore no structures of any known country in the world can be imposed upon it . #% Just imagine the possibilities : citizens from Latvia , Spain , Ireland or Sweden , for example , finding common cause and demanding action . #% It makes all the more urgent the diplomatic initiative to generate respect for the rule of law and a stable governmental process , even if not yet a stable government . #% We heard this week that in the United Kingdom for every one proven case of foot-and-mouth , animals have been slaughtered on five or six farms around that case . #% In particular I welcome the fact that the Commission has recommended that the screening of Maltese legislation should begin as soon as possible , with a view to starting negotiations at the end of this year . #% We want a secure state for Israelis and a viable democratic state for Palestinians , based on the pre-1967 borders . #% Applause from the centre and the left #% Can she say what sort of time-scale is involved in arranging for Ireland - currently a single-zone territory for Objective 1 status - to be divided into more than one region so that areas in the west of Ireland , from Donegal down along the coast to South Kerry or West Cork , might be still considered for Objective 1 area status in the post1999 programme ? #% It would be undemocratic to deny those who have not yet ratified the opportunity to do so . #% The Nitrates Directive fails to take account of climate or soil conditions in Member States . #% I believe that this declaration sends a strong signal from this House to Member States and to accession countries to act to crack down on piracy . #% There is one point I would ask the Commission President-designate to respond to . #% Europe 's institutional framework still needed to be overhauled , decision-making had to be made more democratic and brought closer to the citizens and Europe had to meet its responsibilities to the rest of the world , especially the developing world if the project is to help in bringing the globalisation process under democratic control . #% The House has made it clear from the beginning that we expect strict rules to be applied in the whole area of producing , packaging and marketing cigarettes and other tobacco products . #% I wish to thank Commissioner Wallström for her detailed , informative reply and to assure her that I am aware of the serious concern with which she has always treated this matter . #% Studies show this is the most effective way to tackle tax evasion and protect revenues . #% Those speaking on behalf of retailers and consumers take one view , whereas those in relation to producers have another view . #% We must adopt alternative fuels - biodiesel , fuel cells , gas and electric cars . #% I would sincerely like to thank our Commissioner , Mrs Cresson , for her attention , which will be appreciated by many people in this Parliament . #% The one concern I have -- and maybe the Commissioner or the President-in-Office of the Council could respond to this -- is doubt with regard to the legal basis for this directive . #% in writing . - I welcome the decision of the European Parliament to approve aid for the Dell workers under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund . #% That is why we are asking for a fast-track infringement procedure for test cases in the internal market . #% Mr President , the European Union can be justly proud of its efforts to meet the commitments entered into at Kyoto . #% It is only right and proper that changes be introduced in a structured and coherent manner . #% However , for fear that we will become complacent in this House , 10.7 % of the inquiries referred to the European Parliament , the second highest number . #% The proposed amendments are not justified in terms of environmental benefits and associated costs and other impacts and would disturb the balance achieved . #% First , the retention of effective national control over taxation policy is a matter to which the Irish Government and other European governments have consistently attached the highest importance . #% People are suffering . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , this report allows Parliament to outline our views before the Commission brings forward its proposals on the future of the CAP by the end of this year . #% Mr President , the final report before us today , which was adopted unanimously by the temporary committee , represents the fruits of a most thorough investigation and consultation process , including numerous public hearings and visits to affected areas . #% Due to our economic success in recent years , Ireland is set to reach the threshold of 75 % of average per capita GDP . #% I regret that clearer and more ambitious targets were not included , however . #% In good conscience , I ask people to vote yes and I myself , in good conscience , shall vote yes . #% I would also like to emphasise that the concept of public service and of the public good must go hand-in-hand with liberalization . #% We should use these negotiations as a means of leverage to ensure that China not only listens to EU concerns about its continued abuse of human rights but that it also takes action to improve its record . #% In the year 2000 smuggling of tobacco caused losses of GBP 3.8 million to the British Exchequer . #% One particular problem , Commissioner , is an arms embargo - not just in Burundi - but let us begin with Burundi and then let us look at how we can bring about control of armaments coming from the European Union , which contribute to the terribly sad situations we see occurring in Burundi , in Rwanda and in other regions . #% What does the decision mean for the world community ? #% I believe that Parliament must firmly reject human cloning . #% Poorer regions such as Merseyside in my region , and in the rest of the EU 15 , may continue to need Objective 1 funding , but more importantly than that , today a delegation of trade unionists from Manchester came to Strasbourg to fight to save 650 jobs threatened due to industrial restructuring . #% Over the past decade , Ireland has been progressively reducing its taxation which has been led to an increase in employment , an increase in budget surplus and continued sustainable growth . #% I have seen at first hand the continual bombings of the north-south railway lines over the past 30 years due to the Troubles . #% For many years the Irish people have lived under a cloud of unease as the Sellafield plant has stumbled from one safety misdemeanour to another . #% The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles . #% Unfortunately , over the last 48 hours , President Chandrika Kumaratunga , who belongs to the opposition party , has sacked four key ministers , suspended the Parliament and declared a state of emergency . #% As far as ethical principles are concerned , I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary , unpaid donations of cells and tissues . #% Risk assessment can not be left to each Member State under the terms of framework Directive 89/391 , because it is a Community competence only . #% Mr President , I am very pleased we have been able to have this debate today following the initiative of my own political group to draw up an own initiative report on EMU and economic and social cohesion . #% According to estimates by Senegal 's research institute , which was carried out in 1996 , the available resources at that time would permit catches of some 465 000 tonnes . #% 
Commissioner Lamy gave that undertaking . #% But it will not . #% If they want to maintain Irish influence in Europe , and especially the respected reputation that we have painstakingly built up over the years , the best way of achieving this is to ratify the Treaty of Nice : to reject it is to reject enlargement and unravel the process . #% The composition of the compromise amendments tabled by the rapporteur has maintained this balance between rightholders and users effectively . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I am pleased to learn from the Commissioner that screening the accession chapters relating to Iceland , which began in November of last year , is expected to be completed shortly . #% I can assure this House that we have really tried very hard . #% Now others stand on the edge of that very same precipice . #% The events are straightforward : following an initiative from a Spanish judge , General Pinochet was arrested in the United Kingdom under an international extradition warrant ; he has no diplomatic immunity in that country ; the Spanish Government has 40 days in which to respond . #% We have far too many examples right across Europe of private money corrupting politics and the regulators . #% On a broader level , I support the debate taking place today on the need to promote equality in our society . #% However , this debate is about labelling . #% Mr President , in the time available I want to refer to just one particular line in the budget which is the school milk scheme where the Commission has proposals to reduce the allocation from EUR 96 million to EUR 53 million . #% The recent proposals issued by the European Commission to reform the common agricultural policy must indeed be substantially changed , from an Irish perspective . #% We need to do something here . #% Mr President , I have been working on the issue of drugs since the very first committee of inquiry in which I served with Sir Jack StewartClark . #% Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions . #% We are now into to the third or fourth programme . #% The Commission needs to give an assurance that this proposed level of funding will meet the needs created by the higher levels of Community cofinancing , which can be as high as 50 % . #% He has already offered an average cut of 46 % , which will apply to import tariffs , although there was a clear understanding that the 1999 and 2003 CAP reforms were in preparation for cuts of 36 % . #% What is the chance of the import tariffs remaining at around 36 % reduction and not closer to the 60 % proposed ? #% The essence of the report includes the implementation of the following key provisions : procedures which must be met before a licence can be granted for landfill operations ; the monitoring procedure during landfill sites ' operational phase and closure ; technical conditions to be met by sites and facilities which have to serve as landfill deposits ; classifying the different sets of wastes which can be accepted in landfill sites across Europe and setting targets for the reduction of the amounts of biodegradable municipal waste being deposited in landfills . #% The majority is as beef . #% It is simply unfair . #% Artistic trades are part of our heritage and this knowledge needs to be passed on . #% These are aims and values which we all share , a fact borne out by the unanimous adoption of Ms Lucas ' report . #% In relation to Iraq itself , Iraq was one of the countries in the region with the most advanced education system , with education for all - male and female alike . #% Reducing the GWP threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of CO2 technology is the only option for European car manufacturers at the present time . #% This recommendation should be seen as a first stage in the development of that framework . #% Fishermen want to work with the scientists but the scientists who advise the Commission will not work with them . #% Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness , but we need to acknowledge and recognise , as the Commissioner has made clear , that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice . #% It will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going . #% I hope that South Africa will shortly be able to respond to this improved offer and that every effort will now be made to conclude the negotiations as near as possible to the target date of mid-1998 or at latest by the end of the year . #% The 1999-2000 household budget survey shows that almost 60 % of farm household income now comes from non-farm sources , contributing to the future viability of many farms . #% The Commissioner said that he hoped it would be good enough , but I have to say to the Commissioner that ` hope ' is not enough . #% I agree with Mr Maat about the provision of local abattoirs . #% It is one that still requires unanimous agreement , and I think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the Treaties do not allow the Commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation . #% We recognise the sovereignty of the Nigerian people and their federal government and we are increasingly aware that there is a global community and every citizen of the global community is entitled to our solidarity and respect . #% We should remember that at the moment , within the limits of the money available to us in the financial perspectives , we could raise a further ECU 10b for next year 's budget . #% Of course it was wrong of Blair and Bush to rely on and peddle false information to justify the invasion of Iraq , but the removal of Saddam was right and necessary . #% There are no doubts these days that the creation of the European Union has been a very effective and successful peace process . #% When that occurs , a human epidemic can result . #% In 50 years ' time he will be feted for that ; it is one of the bulwarks of democracy . #% The Sellafield lies , leaks and cover-ups saga has been consistently denounced by my Fianna Fáil delegation in this Parliament , right back to the early days of Windscale . #% That is from a management which is now aware of its shortcomings , a management that foolishly engaged in staff reductions , now reversed thank goodness . #% I support the Environment Committee 's rejection of the proposed quality category being ` sufficient ' rather than proper . #% Events such as this will continue to recur unless and until we establish the `` polluter pays '' principle in the fullest sense of these words . #% I believe that the Community must be at the forefront in international efforts to reduce atmospheric emissions from marine vessels . #% I welcome the idea of a mid-term review for early next year and I look forward to participating in it . #% Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report . #% I congratulate Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , the rapporteur , and Commissioner Busquin , both of whom have realised the importance of this gap . #% Neutralising that text in the areas of common foreign and security policy , defence cooperation and social policy , stripping out qualified majority voting in relation to these areas and , worst of all , stripping this Parliament of its budgetary prerogatives , is a recipe for defeat . #% In every single Member State of the European Community ALTENER promotes renewable energy . #% Environmental complaints are also made on major developments where it is felt that their impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people in the areas affected is being ignored by the developers and in some cases by the authorities concerned . #% What are we going to do in Europe ? #% As the Irish know , Ireland is now open for business , but closed for people . #% I can not therefore accept Mr Hughes ' amendment which would place too many constraints on the fishing industry . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% My group , the EPP group , can only note the result of the Berlin Summit and while it is a significant improvement on the original Commission proposal it falls far short of what is needed by producers . #% The Greek Government sought to put in place in Europe a common political position on Iraq . #% Recently a farmer -- who is a third-generation sheep farmer -- took me to see his last flock of sheep . #% However , the failure to enforce these rules has left too many countries stagnating in an economic period that no longer exists . #% That is the rule as adopted by the Bureau without any consultation with Parliament on those rules . #% This is increasingly the case , even before one deals with the question of allowing either men or women time off to have babies or to look after children . #% The buck must stop somewhere . #% On development issues he is one of the safest pairs of hands as far as I can see . #% Reception countries are happily turning a blind eye to the people passing through their countries on the way to third countries . #% 
Mr President , as from January 1999 , the euro has been the new currency for most of the European Union . #% We are major donors but we have , unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively , as many speakers have said today , just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland . #% On a more national front I welcome the strategy of the Irish Government to reduce road deaths and injuries by 20 % before the year 2000 . #% I have presented to the Commissioner a large print copy of the report and would like to remind colleagues that it is available in this form in various languages . #% Mr President , I made my point about the STOA report when we were discussing the order of business . #% While the government in Khartoum claims to keep peace agreements , which we know it does not , it funds the LRA -- the Lord 's Resistance Army -- from northern Uganda to continue the genocide for them . #% They have murdered an innocent man and severely injured his colleague . #% We have a situation in which conspiracy theories , innuendo and general misconceptions , lies and myths are told about what goes on in the ` dark corridors ' and ` cubby holes ' of the European Commission . #% They are a new breed of people who are mainly women , caring for elderly and disabled relatives on a continuous basis with no recognition for the work which they put in ; with no recognition of the savings which they make for the community in which they live ; with no recognition of the contribution they are making to social solidarity by maintaining people within the home as much as possible . #% It makes sense to have a coordinated EU policy on combating Aids , under the responsibility of a single Aids ambassador/envoy , and I urge Parliament and the Commission to move forward with this proposal and add impetus to the effort to put Aids on the top of the EU development agenda . #% I know very well that he put a lot of time and effort into it and I am happy it can be debated by Parliament today . #% But I wish I could agree with my colleague , Mr Schnellhardt , that the Commission should be left to get on with the job . #% I call on my own Irish Government to support this working time directive in line with the rapporteur ' s suggestions . #% I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish . #% In conclusion , the real message that must emerge from Göteborg before all others - the first among equals of messages - should be clearly addressed to the candidate countries , and say : we are ready to do business . #% I value the transatlantic relationship . #% We use it rather lightly here and as a result it can cause confusion . #% Mr President , I welcome this debate because , following the reform of the CAP , farmers need to look at alternative methods of increasing farm incomes . #% I refer to : Amendment No 11 , which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers ' and artists ' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty ; and Amendment No 4 which , in the second part , introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions , in particular concerning piracy , and amendments on levies . #% We must engage in a continuing and vigorous dialogue with our transatlantic partners in the USA and with Russia where the very name of Kyoto has become discredited . #% Ireland is losing ground in this battle in relation to climate change . #% This Convention is dated 1983 . #% We must also try to ensure that , in so doing , we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater . #% Categorising beef as steers , bullocks or heifers will not do anything to allay the fears of the consumer . #% However , it will symbolise little more than a statement of platitudes and empty rhetoric unless its Statute comes into force . #% The EC Treaty states that ` a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies ' . #% However , in the interim , there needs to be an international agreement outlining the safety standards for such shipments . #% In Ireland now , we are looking forward to not slaughtering cohorts when we discover a BSE case in a herd on farms , but many farms have suffered as a result of our more stringent policy in this regard . #% Countries in Eastern and Central Europe are presently receiving EU Structural Funds so as to make their economies more competitive . #% Mr President , I have been approached by several colleagues who are concerned at the level of lobbying outside the entrance to Parliament . #% in writing . - I voted against this report as I have serious concerns in relation to the EU 's economic and political approach towards the countries that are covered by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement . #% I welcome the fact that the directive as proposed was improved , but it is still not good enough and I hope that it will not destroy the software industry in Europe as we know it . #% The second meeting of the EU-Icelandic Joint Parliamentary Committee will take place in Reykjavík on 26 and 27 April . #% We have got to learn from this and to ensure that in future , we have a solid base for response , as the Commissioner has said . #% The present tourism operational programme for my own country , Ireland , accounts for IRL 369 million , which is over 8 % of total Structural Fund spending . #% Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains . #% That is one of Ireland 's and , I suspect , many countries ' cardinal sins in relation to the area we are discussing . #% So , in the context of the directive on free movement and practice of the professions , we hope there will be improvements here . #% Mr President , I am delighted that the Amsterdam Treaty on the future of the European Union states that the new provisions on public health protection will be introduced with particular focus on committing the European Union to improving the level of human health . #% If we are serious about creating a European Union which has the support of the citizens , we must give a balanced commitment to the development of a social Europe . #% I consider that increasing demand in bioenergy would be achieved by prioritising research , development and demonstration of bioenergy and biofuels - particularly regarding second-generation and most efficient products - by promoting the creation of transparent and open markets and the removal of market barriers and through information campaigns involving producers , suppliers and consumers . #% Mr President , my Group voted against this report because we feel that this issue has been pushed and promoted by the arms industry . #% This nationalistic approach in Parliament towards fisheries is extremely hard to accept from an ecological point of view . #% The Irish government have , in contravention of the law , nominated a person who not only has no experience of economic or financial affairs , but is furthermore a disgraced supreme court judge who was forced to resign before he was impeached by the Irish parliament . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commission to clarify Article 14 . #% We have been told time and time again that stringent controls are in place , that accidents can not happen and that fail-safe systems are in place and then when anything happens , we are told it is the fault of the workers . #% Depression and anxiety disorders , including stress and eating disorders , are the most common mental health problems experienced . #% While the very mention of the term `` GMO '' is enough to grab media attention , it is important that we put things in perspective . #% On alcohol , I wish to support compromise Amendment No 23 , the so-called linkage amendment explained by our colleague Mr Miller , to ensure the distortion should not get greater . #% We should work towards ensuring that by 2003 , which is the European Year for disabled persons , we have guaranteed that the majority of those barriers have been removed . #% Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure ? #% Parliament continually needs to receive assurances to its satisfaction . #% Thirdly , on the evaluation by the Commission and the EIB : is the evaluation purely based on economic return from the work or is it to ensure that there is ground - breaking scientific work which may not have an immediate economic return but could potentially in five or ten years time ? #% They are a military force to be reckoned with and they have extensive military experience . #% The difficulty is that the financial institutions which are given responsibility for selling these products are in many cases resisting them because they can not make enough money out of the categories of people that they are aimed at , mainly the lower income section of the workforce . #% I welcome the commitment and enthusiasm that the Irish presidency has brought to this debate and the personal commitment of the Irish Finance Minister , Mr Quinn . #% In the European Union we need to establish effective and binding regulatory arrangements to solve this problem sooner rather than later . #% In my experience , many directives over the years have had a negative impact on rural areas and rural development because they inadvertently or advertently benefited areas of high population where liberal policies were easier to follow . #% I wish to emphasize again what Mr Walter has put into his report . #% It is unfortunate that we have not been able to utilise our time with them to discuss the document which they presented to the Conference of Presidents last week with regard to the future European social model . #% As a Europe of Values we are committed to ensuring ethics , accountability and transparency as integral parts of all our dealings . #% Seldom have I seen a greater degree of unanimity on the need for reform of the sheep and goat sector . #% Mr President , the last enlargement brought a deeper interest and even a passion into the debate on forestry in this Community . #% We must also ensure that the Commission is held to task with regard to the impact assessment it carries out on proposing legislation and the effect it will have on an industry . #% in writing . - I support this report because it gives an adequate budget framework for the important work of the EU institutions during this time of economic crisis for European citizens . #% I have recently been to Romania and visited some of the institutions we have discussed . #% 
Firstly , can he give a guarantee here to us that this Court of Auditors ' survey will not be used to try and reduce the amount of money which is being appropriated for the SME sector , and in particular for the employment-creation aspect of it ? #% I welcome the fact that in the reports there is a role for Europol and Eurojust as well as between the Member States . #% And so it proved to be that meddle time - happily - was at a premium . #% However , it has not been signed by any Member State , nor by the Community . #% I would like to see the programme supporting efforts to increase young people 's awareness of the political system and indeed the promotion and the development of civics as well , although I know schools are not included in these particular programmes . #% A Community and patenting system must also be enacted within the Union . #% The declaration must now be followed up by real action as set out in specific instruments , realistic targets and effective timetables . #% Non-food uses are also very important , and other reports discussed here tonight spoke of renewable energies and biomass . #% The conclusions of the Tampere Council meeting present a strong political message , reaffirming the Union 's wish to overcome difficulties in prosecuting all forms of cross-border crime while protecting the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Buitenweg for this report and for her commonsensical approach to the issue she has had to deal with . #% Mr President , Commissioner , last month in the emergency debate on foot-and-mouth I indicated that it was not a time for apportioning blame and indeed I sympathised with the plight of British farmers . #% This decision , which was taken by Bertie Ahern and the other finance ministers in 1991 , will have drastic consequences for thousands of workers across the European Union . #% It is a clear demonstration that the political process and the peace process are well under way . #% It is about time that we all faced up to our responsibilities because we have not only ourselves and our environment to think of but future generations as well . #% This also applies to the Commission proposal on POM , prescription only medicines . #% I congratulate the Ombudsman in particular for succinctly identifying - perhaps one of the few to have done so at European level - the underlying reason for the failure of the Irish referendum and that is the gulf between rulers and ruled . #% So its representatives are in a better position to stand up for themselves and make their own deal . #% We look forward to working with her and we hope she will soon share , if she does not already , our enthusiasm for renewable energy . #% We have , as a country , chosen to remain nuclear-free . #% In the area of environmental impact assessments Ireland has taken a minimalist approach . #% We hope that the modernising influences within Turkish politics and society will now take hold of this opportunity and build on it in a positive way . #% It is imperative that we also address the underlying problems within the countries from which these desperate people flee . #% Many of the animals exported live are unsuited to our carcase beef industry and it is to the credit of the Irish Government that we have put in place state-of-the-art facilities for shipment of cattle to third countries . #% They do not allow it to force countries to increase taxes , and they do not allow it to force countries to lower taxes . #% European Union taxpayers have to subsidize heavily something that the vast majority of them are opposed to . #% Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , it is not and can never be a choice between employment or the environment . #% The recommendation that the Commission unequivocally takes account of libraries and their role as an information source for members of the public when resolving copyright disputes , may well be opposed by some Member States . #% The Council of Ministers acknowledged , inter alia , that the economic , ecological and social relevance of the forest sector in the EU and the contribution that forest and forestry can provide to the Lisbon objectives of sustainable economic growth and competitiveness , as well as to the Göteborg objectives of safeguarding the quantity and quality of the national resource base . #% I would say that they reflect probably half -- being generous -- of what the real burden of the disease could actually be . #% Many have lost their children , their health , their homes and livelihoods . #% It is necessary to maintain and enhance these practices by improving the possibilities for fallowing , to allow the sites used for fish farming to be totally rested and flushed . #% My appeal here , however , is that what could be perceived to be an ultimatum accept or leave the Union is most unhelpful in the run-in to a ratification process that is going to be difficult enough anyway , not just in Ireland , but in many Member States . #% Why is it that the McCartney family has to go to Washington , Brussels , Strasbourg , London and other places to get justice when , in its own community , it is not being properly represented by the people who say they represent it -- Sinn Féin / IRA ? #% I wish to ask you Mr President to make contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu to make it clear that the EU is founded on respect for the right of free speech , the right to criticise one 's own government , a free press , and the right to peaceful protest , as fundamental to a democratic state . #% As far as I can see , the registration problem still stands because it is now in the fleet but it was irregular to begin with . #% In particular , the fact that we live in such a rapidly changing world brought about through innovation and technology requires a more rapid response from the European Union to ensure that we can defend as best as possible the interests of all EU citizens . #% In the same letter I received from my constituent , your office said that there are a range of measures that the Commission has at its disposal to deal with any threat to employment . #% Currently there is far too much air pollution , particularly in and around ports . #% It is extremely regrettable if we , at European level , the institutions who organise the common agricultural policy on which the farmers of the Union depend for their livelihood , can not obtain correct information on which to base an effective policy . #% That is an obvious solution : either financial compensation or compensation in some other form . #% Those that think that the system is wrong should practise what they preach and should only present their tickets for reimbursement and should not avail themselves of the other expenses and continue with this sort of hypocrisy . #% Look around the Middle East , and indeed the rest of the world , and what confronts us is an array of weapons of mass destruction , mostly supplied by the developed world , including the European Union . #% The Irish Minister for Agriculture has stipulated that she will prioritise in favour of young farmers . #% We know from the grassroots organisations on the ground that this is far from the truth . #% In particular , what about the undermining of confidence in the Stability Pact which that creates on the wider market ? #% We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways , or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues . #% In addition , because of service cutbacks , women who availed of child care and elder-care , learning support , etc. , are being forced to quit employment to assume those tasks themselves . #% Figures from Interpol show that at the moment there are 60 children reported missing in the European Union and none of them have been traced . #% However , they have been prevented from entering the gallery which is scandalous considering that I made the necessary arrangements . #% One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up , not simply in excellent communications , which we welcome , but in follow-up , follow-up , follow-up !!!! #% The final package negotiated by Commissioner Pinheiro and endorsed by the full Commission is the basis of a solid partnership for trade , development and technical cooperation . #% This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong . #% The broader behavioural , social and environmental factors that determine health can be optimally addressed at Community level through a holistic , as opposed to fragmented , approach . #% What we are trying to do here is improve services for the citizens of Europe so they will understand exactly what has been proposed ; so that consumers will not be frightened that a directive which comes from Europe could privatise or undermine existing services within their country . #% First of all , I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office for the work that has been carried out in organising the coordination between the Member States of the peacekeeping group that is going to Lebanon . #% Now , following the unexpected reconciliation agreement between Fatah and Hamas , which commits to establishing a technical , non-party interim government and early elections , Europe must grab this opportunity to play a positive role in the region . #% Analysis of test data is carried out on an on-going basis by a special TB investigation unit . #% It is indispensable and each part of it has a core , indispensable role and responsibility and benefits by the very fact of the three parts working well together . #% The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world . #% So when we speak about the free movement of workers and when we speak about updating regulations we should be clearer in our focus on two points , namely that , firstly , in Nice the governments decided that this should be done by unanimous voting , not by qualified majority voting , and secondly that there should be no discrimination - either positive or negative - against any worker who is legally resident within the Member States of the European Union . #% I believe the response of the EU in Geneva was appalling . #% I would like to pursue this matter of the supply of arms to the Hutus . #% I salute what he says about the optimum desires for Cyprus and I hope the UN process will take off with his and others ' encouragement but we must remember never to make the best the enemy of the good . #% It is not just an issue for the Commission , it is an issue for the Council . #% It is quite clear that what you are doing here is militarizing the EU , turning it into a military alliance , the main purpose of which is to protect its selfish interests and get easy access to global resources . #% That is why it is most important that we not only learn from the mistakes of the past but also ensure that we never repeat them . #% 
Quite frequently they do not remember or think about the role that cohesion policy has . #% The responsibilities of the European Union are based on the principle that there are some things we can do more efficiently at European level . #% We succeeded in part the second time round in explaining the Treaty , but the lack of understanding of EU issues is still prevalent . #% I believe that we must develop new ways of commercialisation and fully integrate coastal fishermen into the marketing process . #% Instead she used the opportunity to expound a rather theoretical framework on trade which is her own rather than anyone else ' s . #% But we can only work by virtue of the people who come to us with problems and address them and their particular needs . #% There is no need for the IRA to continue to exist . #% This directive is attempting to achieve a massive amount in one brave step . #% We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things . #% If a ferry , for instance , is sailing from Ireland to France , at one stage during its journey it moves out of EU or national territorial waters into international waters . #% The Serbs must stop their incursions into Albania now . #% The Mercosur Trade deal has the potential to seriously undermine European agriculture and the work of European farmers in delivering public goods and high quality , safe food . #% A number of those colleagues , who are sitting on the far side of this House , are a credit to Ireland and their to department for all the work they have done on this . #% Therefore , what is most of all required within the new framework is certainty with regard to the protection available and the responsibilities of the people who are trading on-line . #% The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states . #% But as these facts have only recently come to light , it seems unlikely that the study can look very closely at the issue and I would like an assurance from you that it will be seriously followed up . #% Let us not look to the short term , let us look to the long term , because the long term is the challenge - not five years but ten , fifteen years from now . #% So the rate of change and the types of change which will take place in the future will be even greater and more vast and our capacity as human beings to cope with that change will be determined by the skills , knowledge and training that we are given in the interim period . #% Many are on group water schemes which are not part of the public water supply and have to pay dearly each year for the privilege of rather questionable quality water being distributed to their houses . #% To compound the situation , many of them were in left-hand-drive cars which they had brought from their own homes in Eastern Europe . #% Initial budgetary plans which have been forwarded to the European Parliament for its consideration have included within them a recommendation that monies for road safety campaigns in Europe be reduced by # 1.5 million ( EUR 1.9 million ) . #% I hope this report puts the citizens at the heart of the Single Market and strengthens its social dimension . #% My main point was that this Parliament must not only uphold democracy and freedom of speech - it must be seen to do so . #% Yet when a EU Member State re-introduces internment without trial and abolishes the right to judicial review , we remain silent and condone the kind of treatment that undermines civil liberties and totally ignores the European Convention on Human Rights . #% In the year of disabilities , it is not enough to say we are going to do a lot and then at the end of this year forget all about it and go along as normal . #% Its approach - to state ` this far and no further ' - moves it closer to the British position on Europe , which places more emphasis on a free trade area rather than pursuing political union . #% There is no problem about an exit strategy . #% I want some information about that and specifically about the Industry Council . #% I just want it put on record that I have raised the plight of these people in Guatemala in this House , because I think it is an absolute outrage that people can be treated like that in this day and age . #% This court , which is being opposed by the USA Government would guarantee a fair trial and would apply even-handedly to everyone . #% I welcome this joint resolution and , as mentioned in paragraph 16 , the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries . #% More families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict . #% This initiative will aid the concept of a European judicial culture so that the entire citizenry of the EU will be treated fairly and with dignity . #% It is my sincere wish that his legacy will now be recognised as a man of peace who worked tirelessly for all those in need . #% If we in Parliament can not show enough maturity to deal with the real issues of the European Summit and the European Council , rather than going back to basic party political bickering between different individuals , then it is a sad reflection on this House . #% However , it might be possible to contain an H5N1 outbreak at its source , if the surrounding population were immediately vaccinated . #% However , after the report was debated and voted on in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , there was an outbreak of the acute respiratory disease , SARS . #% The inclusion of natural sun radiation in the new Directive will disproportionately affect small agricultural and construction businesses and add unnecessary administrative costs , particularly in the Northern regions of Europe . #% I did not think you would be in Strasbourg today because you did not attend the Duty-Free Intergroup . #% Mr President I want to put on record one part of the United Kingdom that has been seriously wronged in all of this awful mess that we are in , and that is Northern Ireland . #% We are always hearing that it should be placed at the top of the agenda . #% The UN Convention against the illicit traffic of narcotic drugs prohibits the use , manufacture and distribution of ecstasy , LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld . #% I find it very ironic that Ireland has supported this common position . #% It does not behove the future negotiations and discussions on behalf of Europe that , within this House , we can not even set down proper debating time to discuss real issues rather than abstract principles . #% It is essential that in an ever-changing world , in technological and financial terms , we upgrade people 's skills . #% I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets . #% Planning must not become the sole preserve of those who have an academic qualification . #% I do not want English-speaking people who look at this amendment to think for one second that I voted for that . #% I have seen the newspaper reports that the Irish Minister has requested this ministerial mission and am glad that it has been organised . #% This matter is relevant to us obviously because of the horrific tragedy involving the loss of these young lives , but also because we have dealt with the use of seatbelts in public transport many times in this House with , I have to say , only limited success . #% Some scientists have taken the lunacy of Hitler 's fascism from the battlefield and are prepared to validate it in the laboratory . #% Following the visit by Mrs d'Ancona on a personal basis , I would ask you to intervene with the new British Home Secretary to give her bail so that she can return home with her child , as evidence of the compassion that Tony Blair and the Socialists promised in this particular case during the election . #% I do not agree with my Irish colleagues . #% Finally , let us assume here you have the power to do all of this - and you are telling us you have ; why then was there no effort to reduce or eliminate bank bonuses ? #% The 36 % , 45 % , 55 % proposals at World Trade talks , together with the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy - which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation - and the uncertain implications of enlargement , have created a climate of serious mistrust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven-year agreement . #% I feel young people will not take up farming as a profession . #% He rang me before I came into the Chamber asking me if it would be possible to do that ; it is in your hands . #% We welcome the fact that some redundant workers from big companies will have access to this fund , and call on the companies concerned to seriously negotiate with workers ' representatives and to not use the existence of the fund to back out of their social obligations . #% I would therefore make a plea that the maximum effort should be made to simplify the process so that regional products may be protected and promoted more swiftly , and I welcome what the Commissioner had to say in that regard . #% This type of action is nothing short of criminal and must therefore be dealt with by criminal sanctions . #% It is consistent with the principles espoused by Labour and social democratic parties across Europe . #% However , there is much that we can learn from each other . #% Opium farmers are earning ten times as much as the policemen or soldiers whose task it is to enforce the law against growing opium . #% The European Disability Forum , in particular strongly argues that we need EU legislation to protect people with disabilities against discrimination . #% The current corporate social responsibility debate offers business the opportunity to improve its consumer protection as a good business model and selling point , to help business gain the competitive edge and bring commercial benefits , while providing added value to the consumer . #% EU enlargement will be another central theme at the Helsinki Summit . #% 
Seventy countries are dealt with in this report , where we shine a light on human rights abuses . #% Let us be clear : Amendment No 26 does not promote a free ride for public broadcasters on conditional access services nor indeed on imposing or mandating this . #% We think that indeed there may be a burden but more empiricism and more reflection may have helped . #% I should like to apologise to the Commissioner and to the House for not being here to take the question myself . #% The European Union must also take steps to restore the confidence of consumers and producers in beef as a healthy , safe and marketable product . #% Without consumer confidence , e-commerce is going nowhere . #% In relation to the Gillig report this morning , each year we visit the whole area of further clarification of the exportability of benefits to try to achieve the goal of free movement of more and more of our citizens in the European Union . #% When we demanded individual accountability , we were rebuffed by the shield of collegiality . #% That will spell a very serious failure of the institutions to find common ground and agreement on what is a very important area for the European economy generally . #% I hope his views as endorsed by Parliament will be heeded and reflected in the full version of the Agenda 2000 proposals . #% There will be many solutions in front of us at that time . #% I am one of many Members in this House from EU countries that have facilitated the landing and refuelling of US aircraft -- military and CIA -- in recent years . #% A major difficulty arises because of the constraints of the Blair House agreement on export volumes and the level of export refunds payable , together with the collapse of the Russian economy and the strategic downward price pressure which is applied by other third-country markets as they take advantage of the Russian problem . #% That will not be the case since those concerned about the issues will not be swayed to support it simply because it was finalised during that presidency . #% If the patients - not the pharmaceutical or blood companies - are asking us , we should listen to them and respond to them . #% Although the term ` sustainable development ' is only now reaching treaty - and we are pleased about that - quite clearly there is an obligation on us , under the Treaty , to take into account those other matters . #% I can well understand the sentiments which he expresses . #% Therefore , could the Council and the Commission agree that they would resolutely resist the temptation of bankrolling a pro-Constitution propaganda offensive across Europe ? #% The European Parliament must profit from this occasion to clean up its own act . #% Since its inception , this particular fund has supported more than 3 , 400 individual projects and has helped in the creation of roughly 28 , 000 jobs . #% The task of making the nominations and appointment is reserved exclusively to a Board of Directors of the Bank , which is a quite separate body . #% The United States clearly has double standards : they have allowed many others to enter , including Gerry Adams and Nelson Mandela , with various pasts . #% Due to the time constraints , I will leave it at that and not ask the Minister to give me a response in view of Mr Fitzsimons ' interest . #% This is necessary as Member States add to or change their own legislation in this area and as European Court judgments point out anomalies or clarify certain Articles . #% I thank the Commissioner for her work in this area . #% At the time they joined the European Union there was only a six-mile limit in existence . #% It is that there are 42 million people in the world today suffering from the AIDS virus , yet we have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such this . #% It should be noted that 80 % of first-time smokers in the EU are below the age of 18 . #% Mr President , this area is extremely complex , but it is most important that we address it to ensure the continuing viability of our farms and rural areas . #% Of the estimated 1.2 billion people who live on less than the equivalent of one euro a day , about 250 million live in agriculturally marginal areas , and a further 350 million live in or near forests , of whom an estimated 60 million are indigenous people living in forests . #% We are ruling out the involvement of national parliaments , national governments and the citizens who vote us in . #% I thank them for their statements to the House . #% Obviously , many finance ministers did not support real negotiation . #% But that should not in any way interfere with the need of Parliament here to take what documents this Parliament wishes and to scrutinise them in the best way possible . #% Of course we must have cooperation . #% We will have to deal with many more issues like that . #% If we attempt to undermine the terrorists by using means which themselves destroy freedom , we undermine the very foundations of our own society . #% Neither should we forget that the failure rate and job losses in so-called large industry is much greater . #% The environmental problems have already been named : greenhouse gases - CO2 above all , but also methane , as my colleague , Mr Stockmann , has ably explained ; nuclear power , where there are operational problems and , of course , problems in the disposal of waste and in the transport of fuels ; and oil exploration and production which also involve dangers . #% Finally , I want to draw Members ' attention to one other point . #% EU leaders want to promote more and better jobs and worker mobility , anticipate and manage change in the working environment , combat poverty , exclusion and discrimination , modernise social protection systems and promote equality . #% The Action for Growth initiative must also ensure that the research and development investment target of 3 % of GDP within the Union will be met by 2010 . #% The Commissioner is always excellent on these occasions and gives very generously of his time , as do his officials . #% This is only right and proper , as debt relief is presently crippling many countries in the Third World . #% Such a centre could be incorporated into an established body or foundation through the enlargement of existing competences , as proposed in the PSE resolution . #% Resources should not come from existing budgets and from money that has been promised ; there have to be new resources . #% Moreover , if the Commissioner 's new plan for a radical freeing-up of the market for cross-border services is to succeed , the free movement of skilled professionals will be vital to it . #% The attention of European legislators must also focus on the need to secure more financial resources for greater medical research into cancer prevention and into the health consequences of passive smoking . #% We really need to change our policy on how we treat asylum-seekers and refugees and we have to stop building the barricades higher and higher to keep them out . #% I wish you good health and Godspeed for the next two-and-a-half years . #% One third of this fund , EUR 36 million , will be spent in the border county region , the remaining EUR 72 million being spent in Northern Ireland . #% Would the President-in-Office not agree that the international community , including the European Union , should do more , because this has gone on for far too long ? #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work . #% The Lange report this evening on the control of emissions of gases and other pollutants produced by vehicles continues the progress we have been making . #% They are looking for joint ventures . #% However , a European driver 's licence should be available , like the old international licence , for those who drive in other countries of the Union for more than just a brief holiday . #% It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate . #% This is an issue where , in the WTO , China uses trade as a tool of political blackmail , and we should have used the EU/China WTO negotiations for leverage in the same way . #% The draft Treaty by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention lays the groundwork for the enactment of the new European Union Treaty . #% On freedom of expression , despite reform packages -- and we are now on the ninth -- journalists and writers are not free to comment openly and critically on Turkey or its government members . #% And the remainder would disappear if you took measures on other greenhouse gases like CFCs and methane . #% Cuirimse céad mile fáilte roimh Taoiseach na h ` Eireann agus Aire Gnothai na h ` Eorpa ata anseo chun deire oifiguil a chuir le Uachtaranacht Eireann don Comhphobail . #% Key chapters of discussions which it was said will be opened during the Belgian presidency include competition policy , transport , energy , taxation , customs union , veterinary and hygiene aspects of agriculture , fisheries , justice and home affairs , and financial control . #% Can we do more for them ? #% On a basic human level , a constant supply of good quality products is essential to best provide for the people of Europe who need them because of disease and illness and to that extent we must be able to give certainty as regards the quality of the end product as well as the method of collection , testing , processing and storage . #% Turnout in elections is important , but people 's identity as citizens is not confined to their political identity . #% 
There appears to me and to many other people in my country to be a conspiracy of silence on this issue . #% National control of corporation tax has been a key weapon in the arsenal of many countries in fighting for international investment . #% I welcome Mr Blair 's statement this morning , whatever it means . #% I would like to thank the United Kingdom Government and its Prime Minister for their tremendous effort in guiding the peace process in my country to where it is at the present time . #% It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children . #% Under this legislation local authorities are required to prepare waste management plans either individually or jointly and the Environment Protection Agency is also required to prepare a national hazardous waste management plan . #% Despite its limitations it has stood the test of time . #% It is not simply a question of car manufacturers and the technology they employ ; the governments have been particularly timid in bringing forward incentives , shall we say , for people to use vehicles other than their cars so they are not persuading people to do so . #% Consequently , the Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised by the authorities closest to the citizens . #% This is essential if we are all to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol . #% I want to congratulate , of course , especially John Hume for the immense investment he has made in time and sacrifice in this Agreement . #% The exclusive coastal zone is something that Irish fishermen are adamant about maintaining and so are fishermen from Scotland , Wales , England , France , Portugal and Holland , from Denmark , Germany and others - it is something that I am adamant must be retained . #% Our years of dependence on fossil fuels have left us with two stark conclusions : #% It is absolutely essential that there be representatives from the fishing industry on this board . #% Never was that more highlighted than with the Services Directive . #% The enforced reduction in mobile roaming charges is good for consumers across Europe . #% So I would ask you , Mr President , to request that the Commission carry out an investigation into this matter and report back to this House . #% This temporary opt-out provision should only last for the pilot phase because from 2008 onwards we are obliged to achieve legally-binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol . #% I support the amendments on needle-stick injuries and injuries to healthcare workers . #% At one stage people said that politics is not that important . #% Throughout the EU and North America recent years have seen dramatic reversals in the pollution of air and water due to technological improvements driven by legislation and societal expectations . #% We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma , the economic persecution in East Timor , the religious persecution in Indonesia , Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for conceiving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child . #% As the House knows , the Ecofin Council this year , on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes , issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year 's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy . #% Finally , I would just support Mrs Herranz Garcia , who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night . #% The Committee on Industry covers 120 budget lines - so you can see our task is fairly complex ! #% Madam President , in 2001 , during the BSE and CJD scares and outbreaks , the Commission implemented a temporary ban on feed of animal and fish origin being fed to ruminants , pending thorough scientific risk assessment of the regulation . #% The EU Council must listen to the European Parliament in this regard . #% We are setting up a federal European police force that will carry out its police activities in Member States . #% We support EU reform that gives power back to the people , the elimination of poverty , support for public services , revitalised rural economies , and the reform and strengthening of the United Nations . #% What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular . #% If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group , I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission , its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Trakatellis on the report . #% Words alone may contribute little to the resolution of this conflict . #% But seen from an Irish perspective , this stands logic on its head , we have counties Antrim , Down , Louth , Dublin , Wicklow and Wexford where the vast majority of the population of the island of Ireland , about 2 million people , live on or adjacent to the Irish sea where the majority of British nuclear institutions are sited . #% I would therefore like some clarification on Article 14 from the Commission . #% Mr President , like Mr De Rossa I also question the fact of the amendments being in order . #% We also need finally to take seriously the question of the sorting of waste into recyclable groups of waste and of course , the recycling of treated waste . #% Now we find that you have , maybe somewhat precipitately , made a unilateral offer to slice those tariffs by a further massive percentage . #% The euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world ' s most counterfeited currency , unless we all make concerted efforts to ensure that the counterfeiters are defeated . #% I have already said we support as necessary the collegiate nature of the Commission . #% The marching season is not over in Northern Ireland yet . #% Animals which react positively to the TB test are slaughtered . #% I say on behalf of my group - and this is not the responsibility of a hard-working Portuguese presidency , but a failure of a collective will - that we regret the failure to date to make more progress on some of the basic issues . #% In the face of intimidation and threats he has fiercely defended the most basic rights of the most vulnerable in any society , the children . #% As many people have already said , the justification for the invasion and occupation of Iraq was about the existence of weapons of mass destruction but , as we all know , it was more about regime change . #% Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey 's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds , I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country . #% There are stories going around at the moment that in Britain they are going to actually block sales to certain countries in the world because of the campaign against the arms trade . #% While I acknowledge that the Irish presidency has to tread sensitively in pursuing progress on the draft Constitution , I support Commissioner Prodi 's warning that failure to reach agreement will inevitably lead to the creation of a two-speed Europe . #% We are also all aware of the environmental proofing of EU regulations and directives which is now constantly taking place . #% I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism , but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty , exploitation and oppression . #% We can go with a ` yes ' or we can go with a ` no ' , but there is no debate on the basis of ` yes , but ... ' . #% This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU . #% I trust this report will receive widespread and deserved approval . #% That is a study carried out by a foundation funded by the European Union . #% I do not like the back door . #% In return , European citizens will receive not just reliable , high-quality goods which are guaranteed to have been farmed to the EU 's high standards of practice , but will also benefit from the societal and cultural implications of the CAP , such as those contained in Pillar II . #% Without patent protection the small company could have found itself in a perverse situation where its R&D efforts would have been free for the multinational company which , with its team of patent lawyers , would have gained the patent in this area . #% There is a clear need , based on the information that has been provided to us , for the European Union to become engaged in seeking to develop best practice across the European Union to ensure that the people of Europe have adequate access to services , therapies , drugs and indeed aftercare , and that they are not discriminated against in relation to employment . #% People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working . #% Unfortunately , for feminist women , the family has become sort of battleground . #% It is completely unacceptable that , in relation to fisheries agreements , EU fishing vessels take priority over the rights of people in other countries . #% Both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the European Parliament and require a thorough debate . #% I fully support the need for adequate , flexible maternity leave , but I believe it is for the elected UK Government to decide , with an input from parents and their employers , how much our own economy can afford to give and how a maternity package is to be delivered . #% Perhaps the President-in-Office might consider how best we can help to bridge the gap that needs to be bridged , particularly in relation to the Palestinian issue and the lack of progress that has been made there . #% It then went back to the Bureau , and the Bureau made the decision on the basis of what , I assume , the Conference of Presidents had requested . #% In the case of beef alone , prices would actually fall below the price of production . #% 
I am curious and dumbfounded that some of my colleagues on the left in the GUE/NGL Group also seem to think the report is irrelevant , but perhaps that is a reflection of the point I made that the dividing line between left and right is changing in this modern world of ours and that it is not that there are no differences but that the lines are shifting . #% Knowing the state of ` underdevelopment ' of recycling and waste management in my own country , Ireland , for example , I sincerely hope they mean what they say in agreeing to this directive and I fully support the fact that they have done so . #% The creation of new European norms of behaviour in office must apply with no less force and conviction to the European Parliament than they will to any future European Commission . #% There is currently a need for simplification to be brought into any new arrangement , with the minimum of red tape . #% You may laugh , Mr President , but I am serious . #% We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order . #% We have to factor that into our calculations . #% We are against such an approach . #% The Committee of Experts was established , as you will see if you read the terms of reference and the original vote in this House , under the auspices of Parliament not one of its committees . #% You can not face both ways at the same time , no matter how hard you try . #% They wo n't . #% We believe that the exploration of other forms of stem cell , and indeed comparisons , are essential . #% Even though the overall reduction in working hours may be postponed for some time , the actual rest-period times and so on come into force immediately . #% I believe that Ireland was one of a number of countries who opposed the directive after it passed through Parliament in 1999 on the grounds that it might make ferry services to peripheral regions uneconomic to run . #% Citizens are sometimes disillusioned with the EU . #% Then , in classic IRA style , the intimidation brigade swung into action to silence the witnesses . #% The other Commissioners would do well to review their own policies and see how they are supporting cohesion . #% I presume he has answered many of the questions the public in general have been asking , but I am not sure if those answers will be to their satisfaction . #% I have just two very brief questions to ask him on this point . #% It took us two and a half years to agree that instrument because we simply would not give up on certain core rights of Parliament , but we did have to compromise towards the end . #% We sometimes feel helpless as individuals against this massive global challenge but , at the end of the day , people need to be encouraged to do their bit , as little contributions such as the ` Power of One ' do add up . #% We must continue with the voluntary ethos . #% Is it not time once and for all for the Council of Ministers to meet in public on all these matters when it acts as legislator ? #% I am very happy to support Mr Pimenta 's report . #% Will you be making a strong case for Community interests ? #% I believe that the countries of the OSPAR Convention must now form broader international links with other countries along the main shipping routes of nuclear waste , which includes countries around the Panama Canal , South America , and the coast of Africa . #% The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan is a legitimate objective . #% I come from a country , Ireland , which in some ways is out of step with the major demographic trends evident in other EU Member States . #% I am totally opposed to a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office with its powers extending over the territory of all the Member States . #% I welcome the strong endorsement by the UN this evening of that draft resolution . #% The proposed European Commission directive to increase competition in port services in the EU threatens to reverse this . #% Any proposal to give the European Council the power of qualified majority voting on justice and home affairs would be , I believe , very unwise . #% We must also ensure that , while they are abroad , students continue to receive education grants from their home Member States and that the Erasmus programme is not exclusive to those who can afford it . #% I note what the Commissioner has just said concerning the conclusions of the 2000 review : ` the system works well , the results were good , the system is up and running ' . #% I hope that at the end of the temporary conference all Member States will ratify the setting up of the International Criminal Court so that the war criminals who are so prevalent today throughout the world can be prosecuted . #% And finally , President , I would say that with regard to the role of the Council of Ministers , we know that they meet in private . #% I am disappointed with the answer to the question . #% I have tabled certain amendments . #% I also welcome the public service character of Eurocontrol . #% May it be particularly infectious in our country of Ireland as we endeavour to awaken from their slumber , from their indifference the 65 % of the Irish electorate who failed to turn out to vote for the Nice Treaty last June , as we yet again try to offer them the opportunity to endorse enlargement of Europe between now and the end of December this year . #% I also note with deep regret that just yesterday a Vietnamese court sentenced eight people to death for drug offences ; eleven people have already been sentenced to death this year . #% We urge you , both in choice of your Commissioners and in such an eventuality , to use your fullest powers under that Treaty and to demonstrate that indeed you are your own man . #% In relation to the controls he is proposing to impose on livestock producers so that we will have full records of the origins of cattle and their feed ; is he proposing to impose the same controls on the half a million tonnes of beef which we import into the Community annually ? #% Will there be zero excise in international waters ? #% I can not accept that it is impossible for us to find an additional EUR 15 million in the vast budget that we will be approving here in a short period of time . #% The position the Committee on Foreign Affairs puts forward in this resolution under my name is the appropriate benchmark for judging how much progress has been made . #% My understanding is that the European Commission initiated proceedings against the Irish Government with respect to this vessel and that these proceedings have now been withdrawn . #% It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately . #% This is an austerity budget which stays in line with inflation . #% Demographics , infrastructure , size and isolation make it very difficult for Ireland to meet the same targets and deadlines as other countries . #% I appeal through the President to my colleague to look at this again . #% Ninety millimetres should be the minimum mesh size in order to protect nursery areas and reduce discards . #% The Commission should support Commissioner Flynn on this matter and get rid of tobacco subsidies in the interests of public health and of consumers . #% Madam President , we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves . #% The Convention was not set up specifically to draft a constitution for Europe . #% Mr President , you will note by the number of Irish people wishing to speak in the debate today that this is an issue very close to our hearts . #% This has got to be acted upon , and acted upon positively , and the response should be made in a very responsible and effective manner . #% There is a long litany of incidents and disputes . #% The adoption of this ILO convention can help reduce the numbers of working poor , improve working conditions and facilitate the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable workers . #% The first time it asked for this was only two weeks ago and , by that time , the international press had already pushed the alarm bells and the President finally had to admit that there was a catastrophe in the region . #% Therefore , the ending of some of these aids so suddenly could potentially have a serious effect on some of the Member States in the EU , but it is important for the sector to realise that they should not rely solely on these aids in the future . #% Finally , on the question of the Irish referendum , the message given both by the Council and the Commission today is an important one . #% That is the reality as far as I see it . #% Is it because the Commission knows that co-existence will not work ? #% However , our tolerant and open society is under threat from organized crime and from the drug trade . #% Commissioner , you mentioned that the figures do not show the real burden of the disease of mental health . #% 
A textbook approach of the kind seen far too often has not always served to meet citizens ' requirements in this important area . #% The observation is that we should not make the best the enemy of the good , which is to say that there are many here who would like to promote the CO2 tax , but it has run aground on the unanimity requirements of Article 99 . #% As an Irish Member , I believe we have benefited from what has been known as ` the Irish amendment ' . #% I wish to emphasise that the German Government should approach the issues of the reform of the common agricultural policy and the reform of the Structural Funds as well as the future financing arrangements of the Union in a balanced and even-handed manner . #% Building capacity both in the public and private sectors , enhancing production and conforming with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries , in particular external investment and expanding economies . #% If our constituents saw us in this light they would be very impressed . #% Further steps can be taken to solidify this in the future , which is much needed as far as investment and , indeed , research and development is concerned . #% This system has obvious uses in the fields of air and sea transport and can also be used in road transport . #% I really think it is irresponsible of the EU to push something through without a proper study being carried out and , as Mr Miller said , any studies done to date have been by vested interests on both sides . #% As far as I am concerned Mr Chirac got all he deserved here . #% Equally , sponsorship by tobacco companies of events or activities involving several Member States will be outlawed . #% In Ireland there is no legal requirement for seatbelts on school buses . #% We can speak about it again and again , but there must be positive action to get it up and running , to give a core element to innovation and research in Europe . #% For my group that would be a serious and significant priority . #% I hope we will do this following the ratification of the Europol Treaty . #% We must ensure that a mechanism is put in place to effect the safe elimination of existing fluorinated gases as well . #% The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation 's mandate . #% Indeed in my own county of Meath we have problems with the quality of water there . #% I would suggest that the way to remedy this would be firstly that all appointments and contracts be openly advertised , decided independently and scrutinised by the Parliament . #% However , on balance I believe it to be a good starting point for a comprehensive debate on the issue and shows that the Committee can work together . #% I hope these can help move the process forward and that this lobbying will encourage the US to review its isolationist position on Kyoto . #% You can not prevent a failure by a single individual and it only takes one person not to follow those controls and the feeding of swill creates a real problem as seems to have been the case in the United Kingdom with foot-and-mouth . #% Taoiseach , you have mentioned the importance of training and education and the connection with drug-taking in cities such as Dublin . #% A new report , which is both timely and in terms of content deeply worrying , has been prepared for the European Parliament . #% Call it a for a new Europe , but not a for a new Europe . #% Incidents occurring in one Member State are not necessarily known in another Member State and similar circumstances can lead to fatal accidents . #% Let me say very clearly , as I have said many times in the past and will say again at every available opportunity , that the common fisheries policy is not only about fish but also , and most importantly , about fishermen . #% It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe ; from having a Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders , unable to share power and unable to share a future together . #% In the coming years , Chinese requirements alone will increase to unheard-of levels . #% Although criticism was building over nine years of her tenure , the UN structures as they have evolved did not allow any internal investigation of UNICEF . #% It is , in my view , a renationalisation of agriculture policy by the back door . #% Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply . #% The gamma-interferon test is the most promising of these , and is used under practical field conditions as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in herds . #% In areas of rapid technological progress , the European Union must make a special effort to avert any future barriers in the internal market as a result of conflicting national rules and establish a European legal framework at an early stage . #% The suffering and terror endured by the injured and those who died - including four children - during the several days they spent in this sealed metal container is barely conceivable . #% In Ireland , the nitrates directive , for example , is beginning to bite and having such serious consequences that the farming organisations have withdrawn from the government-sponsored social and economic partnership talks . #% Therefore I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to bring up this matter immediately at the next Council meeting , if possible so that there will be no more delays , so that opportunities will no longer be denied to many students who have not benefited up to now , or whose parents have had to pay for them to study abroad ; and so that these anomalies and inequalities will be removed in future . #% This work is very encouraging . #% I should also like to pay tribute to the secretariat of the Development Committee and to the secretariats of those groups that worked constructively with us in these negotiations . #% Therefore , my Group , although it supports the two reports , wants a lot more from you , Commissioner , and from our Member States . #% He said that without John Hume there would truly have been no peace process , and of David Trimble he remarked that without David Trimble there would have been no peace agreement . #% It is very difficult to find in this methodology which are the real priorities , where there is political passion and focus , and which are merely the issues that we have to deal with because they are part of due process . #% Again , I congratulate you and wish you well . #% Ill health as a result of obesity is costing taxpayers millions of euro each year and exerting extreme pressure on health services . #% Personally , I am adamant that the rural economy , SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals . #% Therefore , if this Charter were to be incorporated into the Treaties , it would supersede the European Convention on Human Rights , it would supersede any national constitutional provisions and would also supersede any national legislative provisions . #% We have also launched this year Telefís na Gaeilge , an all-Irish-speaking television station . #% It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively , to ensure the stability of the financial system . #% Pre-commercial procurement is a specific approach for the public sector to engage R&D , with a view to driving innovation to ensure sustainable high quality public services in Europe . #% In fact , the European Union can play a very significant role in disseminating best practices through what we have achieved in the Union itself . #% I believe that the four amendments submitted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation must be accepted by the Commission and I hope that the Commissioner , Mr Patten , who did not very often give me happy replies on other things when he was in another office , perhaps today will give me some little encouragement that Christmas is really coming . #% I support the main thrust of this directive as we must strike a balance between promoting commercial enterprise and protecting European consumers at all times . #% However , we can not vote for the report itself , even if - as we hope - those amendments are adopted , because of the underlying policy and belief that we in the European Union can export our over-capacity , and that we have some historic right to exploit developing countries . #% I should like to thank Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Fabra Vallés personally for their efforts to resolve the problem relating to the Veterinary Institute in Grange and to express my satisfaction with the outcome . #% But one of the greatest problems - and here I want to come back to support what Mrs Harkin said - is the delay in approving new strands of GMO grains for imports into the European Union . #% However we are not divided on our concern for human rights and democracy , and the resolution before the House was supported unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs . #% The European Union is the biggest aid donor in the world , donating 60 % of aid , and we are probably the biggest donor of humanitarian aid as well . #% Others are being sold , so I agree with those who say we must not shift the whole responsibility onto the developing world . #% What is wrong ? #% In a matter as weighty as this it is not right , on whoever ' s part - and I do not know who is to blame for this leak - to seek a route which chooses the sensational over the institutional management of this issue . #% Affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure . #% We have to learn the lessons of Bosnia and apply them as well . #% Countries with low debt should be allowed to invest in key infrastructural projects of national importance . #% In the resolution tabled today by my political group , we stress that there must be sound management in the administration of all EU programmes and initiatives . #% Much of that is genetically modified and it is ironic that European consumers are concerned about GM and yet we have to rely on GM protein for much of our animal feed . #% However , the important decision is for Parliament to establish its position and thus let the agriculture Council bring in urgently needed changes . #% 
Over-description would only lead to confusion and is unnecessary . #% As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive . #% We have heard already today how important it is to have a legal base in energy with reference to renewable energies . #% The Greens fully support the EU 's decision to withdraw trade preferences for Burma on both industrial and agricultural goods , but more action needs to be taken . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate , as I believe it gives us the chance to raise the difficult degrees of sanctions imposed on the fishing fleets in different Member States of the European Union . #% They make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself , but a work in progress and they do nothing to conceal their ambition to have it , in their terms , strengthened at the first opportunity -- without , of course , the troublesome obstacle of further national consultation . #% The current unfavourable economic climate for farming in general and young farmers in particular , the obvious lack of prospects for young farmers , the decline in the number of full-time farmers and the consequent ageing of those who remain - these are all general trends which underline the problem . #% If the European Union as a political entity is to grow and prosper , we must ensure that its schoolchildren are given opportunities to learn different languages , to experience the education systems of other countries within the European Union . #% Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action . #% The European Union is right to be active in contributing to the institutional and economic rebuilding that is presently taking place within the former Republic of Yugoslavia . #% It is not easy to be in a situation of leadership , it takes a lot of courage . #% Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century . #% It was a tragedy but also proved to be a catalyst when finally the political classes woke up to the fact that there was a really serious problem . #% This is a new technology and one that offers huge potential in the medical field for the treatment of many diseases for which as yet there are no cures , and for the relief of suffering and pain for millions of people . #% Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years . #% Let us face reality and base our decisions on scientific considerations . #% It is particularly pleasing that this has taken place with good faith being shown on both sides and also that they have been addressing political , human rights and social and economic issues . #% 14 , 000 people live on the nearby island , and if there were to be a major accident , their only point of exit would be a bridge which is only 300 metres from the new plant . #% Such instability is certainly not in the long term interests of the European farm model which we purport to represent in the context of Agenda 2000 . #% It should assist in improving competitiveness through investment and in improving skills training for our workers and for the temporary unemployed . #% Madam President , with regard to Alzheimer 's disease I am especially pleased that Parliament has been able , even in a small way , to play a role with regard to this major health scourge . #% Mr President , from the spin of today one would think that much had been achieved at Hampton Court , but as we have already heard , the verdict of the informed EU press was almost universally negative . #% The intention behind the postal directive was good but , like all good intentions , the application was not so good . #% in writing . - This proposal on behalf of the mobilisation of EGAF for German workers - as well as the proposal from the Lithuanian refrigeration sector - was to be among the first beneficiaries of the fund in 2010 . #% I should like to refer to the remarks made by the President-in-Office and Mr Ó Neachtain . #% Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem . #% The 350 million people who make up the membership of the European Union will not thank either the European Parliament or the European Commission if we are seen in the public eye as having a fractious relationship in any shape or form . #% The people who are producing this cocaine and heroin , and causing such havoc in our cities and towns and the countryside , must be stopped . #% I am very disappointed at the result of this referendum in Ireland but I fully respect the outcome of this democratic process . #% I also believe that we in the European Union must put our house in order . #% Take a scientific , evidence-based approach and re-examine this proposal rather than - with respect - just dance , albeit belatedly , to the tune of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea . #% We must never allow a government to use the Commission as a retirement home for politicians past - to use a consumer term - their `` sell-by date '' or for a political pay-off for old pals or indeed to export a national embarrassment to Europe . #% But we ask the Commission to come forward with a framework directive that will lay down a clear timeframe and detailed monitoring methods because at the end of the day we must protect the most vulnerable and pedestrian safety in our communities is of the utmost importance . #% I congratulate Parliament 's rapporteurs on their work and indeed the quality of both these reports and all of those people who have provided very good opinions to the reports . #% There is a major vacuum here in that European taxpayers ' money goes to fund these fisheries agreements without the possibility of looking to see how the money has been spent , particularly when it is in the area of development and surveillance . #% We regret that we were unable to change the whole pro-incineration approach to a pro-recycling approach . #% I particularly welcome the commitment to streamline the codecision procedure , thus putting both sides of the European Union legislature , the Council of Ministers representing the Member States and us , in the European Parliament , representing the people , on a truly equal footing . #% The inclusion of undesirable ingredients by feed manufacturers in animal feed was responsible for BSE and the Dioxin scare . #% In your answer to me you say that the fiscal advantage to the air traveller will be very small . #% Unfortunately , the report does not compare projects for effectiveness , nor does it set down the criteria on which projects are or should be assessed . #% Could the Commission indicate whether it will be proposing the repealing or amending of this regulation , because this is a most important issue . #% As my second point , I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recital A. Alas , this besotted committee feels it can not speak without showing cringing deference to the illfated Constitution , ever peddling the lie that it will deepen democracy , when in reality it is assetstripping every nation state of more democracy and more power . #% But whenever the Commission tries to put these obligations into effect , they are shot down by Parliament and the Council . #% My Group leader , Mr Poettering , is right : we must not equate the Arab world with terrorism . #% If these things can happen -- and they have happened -- with these countries supposedly adhering to the European Convention on Human Rights , then moving the coordination from the Council of Europe to the European Commission will contribute nothing to the effective guarantee of individual rights in real terms . #% Lift those stringent measures ? #% Indeed , they were coming so fast at one stage that they were being discarded before they were implemented . #% Between 1991 and 1994 the SAVE programme funded a total of 203 pilot projects in the energy efficiency field . #% They are spread through the air and through the food chain very far from their sources , even to regions where they have never been used or produced . #% Maybe it is too late tonight , but we would like an answer because you are negotiating , despite the fact that there is an agreement to ban tuna imports and this agreement is very much related to that . #% This issue is going to go on and on . #% My government welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Commissioner and the programmes she has launched . #% In conclusion , the very existence of the Cohesion Fund has been of the utmost importance for Ireland . #% While voluntary agreements play an important role with regard to the whole issue of air travel , EU institutions and EU governments must not be afraid to intervene and legislate on issues to promote and protect air passenger rights . #% We need to recognise the effects and risks of reprocessing , shipment and reshipment on everyone , not just the countries of origin and destination that are making money from the nuclear business . #% Mr President , I was interested to hear Mr Tannock remind us that these agreements between the European Community and Israel have been in operation since 1975 . #% If we do not get our amendment through , we will face a huge problem next year in the budget and there will be cuts across all of the budget lines in agriculture . #% Only last December I raised this issue in the Irish Senate and cited all the various directives - mainly environmental directives - we had failed to transpose within the timetable or years after the deadline for transposition had taken place . #% My group subscribes to the broad detail of the resolution , so I will not rehearse the issues . #% I refer specifically to the 2001 directive which deals with strategic environmental impact assessments and the 2000 directive which deals with the prudent use and protection of water resources -- all of which are the subject of this complaint . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single European currency into the European Union is now only a matter of twelve months away . #% Mr President , environmental protection is now a priority for most Member States , and European citizens are increasingly aware of its social and economic potential . #% Finally , Madam President - if I may be allowed the same latitude as the other group chairmen were allowed - when we speak about energy and common energy policy and energy needs , one of the biggest opportunities that we are denying ourselves is the renewable energy that we can create and grow on our land . #% Mr President , I am very glad to participate in this debate , mainly to give a voice to the many children , young adults with handicaps and those living in inappropriate state institutions in Romania , which I visited recently . #% It is affected by many factors including structural policy which does not take employment into account in issues of vessel size . #% Whatever one 's views about the future of nuclear power , mine are considerably less optimistic than those of others who have spoken . #% 
Does she agree that there is a need for greater coordination between national policies and those designed to achieve rural development objectives and that there should be more concentration on decentralisation and the creation of new employment opportunities in the regions ? #% The truth is that we ban American beef today because those hormones are there ; but the truth is also that we know that , if we allowed the Americans to sell that beef into our market , at good value to our consumers , and if we were to put a label on it saying those hormones were there , they would still buy it . #% I want to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Mr Diamandouros has engaged in an astonishing level of activity , not only in dealing with the thousands of complaints he has received , but in preparing his office for enlargement and in visiting almost all of the Member States , including all ten new Member States . #% I welcome the recent article written by him in the New York Times in which he stated that the Palestinians were ready to end the conflict with Israel . #% It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy . #% This has been side-stepped down the years but it is high time that the Commission bites the bullet . #% I greatly welcome his emphasis on the need for monitoring and the need for the European Parliament to be involved in such monitoring - not just in the JRC . #% The numbers of displaced people are increasing , with the UN reporting an additional 150 000 left homeless last month alone . #% I am sorry to have to say again and again that I can not accept the principle of relative stability without one reservation . #% You are correct in saying that food labelling is not enough to protect consumers . #% In Dublin this weekend , Gerry Adams boasted that the IRA campaign of atrocities were the acts of freedom fighters and not the acts of terrorists . #% I , for one , share that approach . #% They have been denied justice by the UK , Irish and EU authorities though they are entitled to redress and protection when regulators fail . #% However we believe it is premature in the debate to take a fixed position on the future options for designating European Assisted Areas . #% In January this year there was an unfortunate case where a man lost his life in this steel factory . #% I have to say to you , Commissioner , that we are here for the next five years . #% What is the situation regarding our immunity ? #% The Government does nothing to stop the fires because there are big-money interests involved . #% The weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed to protect the free world . #% Madam President , thank you very much indeed for arranging this very important debate at this particular time . #% And advances in technology with new research techniques mean that the people employed in this sector are generally very highly qualified . #% We are all members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and we will be led by our colleague , Mr Blokland , as our vice-chairman . #% As well as that , with the introduction of the single currency next year and the changeover in financial markets and other similar situations , there is a great fear , and a danger , amongst Member States , private individuals and institutions , that not enough work has been undertaken . #% It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction . #% I would urge the Commissioner to take it on board as a proposal . #% In particular , paragraph 8 was an important political signal to the Council . #% My personal priority today , as with the last speaker , is on the issue of financing the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland . #% The point I would like to raise with the Commissioner relates to the whole question of the transposition and implementation of directives . #% He went to Burundi as Apostolic Nuncio and it was there , while returning from a pastoral visit in one of his dioceses , that he was murdered . #% This survey also showed that consumers are still charged a lot more for making cross-border transfers than they are for making national transfers . #% Mr Moscovici , Commissioner Patten , I also would like to be associated with the words of welcome to our honoured guests , Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg . #% I disagree with you that it is not within the Council 's remit . #% Greater effort must be made by the European Commission , Parliament and the Council to implement European Union directives and regulations in as streamlined a manner as possible . #% The politics of this region must be put aside in an effort to save lives , and this motion welcomes the coordination and opening of new routes between India-controlled Kashmir and the Pakistan side . #% It is good that opinion in Britain is changing in favour of the right of coastal fishermen , which I always accepted , to exploit their own resources . #% Another report says we are only half self-sufficient so it a pity that students or even planners looking at documents like this see such contradictions within a few pages . #% But a lot is in the hands of the politicians in both communities in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this report . #% The constitutional position in each Member State has to be taken into account . #% But I have spoken with organisations in the UK and Ireland this morning who are clearly as frustrated as we are . #% Indeed , I am happy to say that in most Member States I know this system already applies . #% We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work . #% There are so many things that remain to be done and so many priorities that were set down at Lisbon , Stockholm , or Cardiff that have yet to be completed , to be achieved and to be reached . #% Eleven countries have not signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings . #% I personally favour cracking down on misleading and deceptive practices rather than attempting to achieve a common definition of fair commercial practice . #% I believe that the European Union and the United States working together will do their very best to get the talks under way . #% In our joint motion for a resolution we have called for a wider examination of the root causes of the conflict . #% At this stage I would like the Council to offer some hope in a very important area where there is obviously not enough work being done to promote this important aspect of education . #% Mr President , I too acknowledge the presence of the President-in-Office and I want to thank the Commissioner for his openness and willingness to engage in continuing debate on the future of European agriculture . #% It would be worthwhile if we had this study brought forward as quickly as possible , perhaps with a more open mind , to see if it is possible to retain duty-free sales . #% Obviously , the most important and topical challenge facing consumer policy is indeed the BSE crisis . #% When he first came into this House and made his maiden speech , he spoke about the rights of pensioners and the duty that each of us had towards them for the future . #% We must also ensure that in our schools and colleges more emphasis is given to looking forward to seeing where the new skills are going to be required in 10 years ' time so that we can put in place the training programmes for that as well . #% Ten years after the crucial Rio de Janeiro Summit , expectations have not been met . #% We have to therefore grapple seriously with the whole issue of immigration . #% The European Central Bank is satisfied that the requisite amount of the new euro notes will be dispersed to financial institutions in non-Euro zone countries . #% This strategy contributes to the ` Clean air for Europe ' programme , for which I was Parliament 's rapporteur . #% Under this regulation , for example , the trimmings on collars will be labelled clearly and separately from the rest of the garment , allowing consumers to make an informed choice about the clothes they buy . #% Many of our assistants may lack proper social security and other cover . #% Clearly , it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs . #% The Irish peace process was based on the unconditional cease-fire of the Provisional IRA . #% This article should not be changed or watered down into a Trojan horse to halt or hold back the process of the completion of the internal market . #% Solemnly I salute them today in this House . #% The Commission ' s determined effort to restore consumer confidence by putting effective control mechanisms in place is clearly welcome . #% The idea of a safe country , the idea that governments can actually claim that certain countries are safe , is quite incredible . #% 
That is something that she is right to continue to develop . #% No one could , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist . #% When this original directive was voted on by the European Parliament , a specific clause was inserted , known as Amendment No 95 , which recognized the right of small farmers to freely re-use all patented seed and to save and further develop their own seed . #% I have made a proposal in the European Convention that we should bring Europe home by having a coordinated European Week in each of the national parliaments , where we would invite a Commissioner to a national parliament to present the annual legislative programme ; where the MEPs from a particular Member State would be present in the Parliament ; where you would generate some national interest in what the European Union is doing , and what the European Parliament proposes to do in terms of scrutinising the Commission and the Council for the following year . #% The ordinary citizen wants to know what this treaty is all about . #% The new instrument must be sufficiently funded . #% Just because something is natural , it does not necessarily mean it is healthy . #% I want to mention that during the first year of the new President there were 260 public hangings , hundreds of secretly-executed political prisoners ; 7 people stoned to death in public , not to mention those stoned to death in secret . #% I condemn it for that . #% I will not pretend to be happy with this situation . #% Let us debate the political issues . #% With these clarifications entered for the record I am happy to vote for Mr Haarder 's report . #% These proposals relate to natural disasters , such as fires , droughts and floods . #% My own experience of Ireland , which has done particularly well and is held up as an example , is that the money we have transferred over 15 years - which peaked in 1992 , before the present programme - went to public sector pay and social welfare rather than to economic infrastructure . #% Mr President , this has not been a very controversial subject . #% I thank my colleagues for their understanding , particularly Mrs Schleicher , who represented our case with understanding through all stages , especially at conciliation . #% I should also like to remind Members of this House that what has happened in East Timor after the referendum is something we should look at . #% Angling has a long and important heritage in the east of Ireland , with scenes of anglers at rivers such as the Slaney or on the shores of the east coast a popular depiction of Irish culture . #% I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient handling of the budgetary question , which has enabled us to vote today . #% Mr President , in his report Mr Mombaur has certainly given a comprehensive coverage of the implications of the liberalization of these markets . #% Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland . #% It is another example of rural development in action -- and it does work . #% Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme . #% I would ask you to consider very carefully how we proceed here , particularly as we are not in a position to have a debate . #% Rural development is going to make a very important contribution to the future of rural society . #% Mr President , first of I all I should like to say that I agree completely with the sentiments and the concerns expressed by my colleague John Cushnahan . #% Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open manner in which he chose to present his report in plenary . #% It is essential that the remaining legislative and practical steps be completed rapidly . #% My report proposes radical surgery to remove the glut of exemptions but still proposes the retention of green exceptions . #% The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic . #% I would suggest that we need to take the notion of ` intelligence ' in its broadest sense . #% The European Union has no legal right to provide or promote abortion and it is unacceptable to use public funding for this purpose within the Member States , candidate countries or developing countries where it is unacceptable to communities . #% We are now voting on Amendment No 11 which deletes them . #% We also need clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the consensus and the UN guidelines . #% It appears that governments in neutral countries have a tendency to mislead citizens . #% Furthermore , given the present geo-political climate , with the increased possible threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe , we should consider how best to prevent such an attack occurring . #% I would also encourage Member States to develop this system as quickly as possible , because it will be part of the short-term resolution of the crisis , and I use that word advisedly , that exists at the moment with the availability of veterinary medicines on the ground . #% On behalf of my group I would like to propose that we do not agree with the rapporteur ' s request to send this back to Strasbourg for voting . #% Indeed , I have evidence that construction activities are taking place . #% Nonetheless I welcome the rapporteur 's support for the principles of Community preference , financial solidarity and a single market , and his warnings about price cuts . #% In conclusion , it is incumbent on all legislators within the European Union to ensure that the utmost is being done to ensure that air travellers are entirely safe in the journeys they take . #% Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish : real , effective actions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe now . #% We do have a clear and consistent voice when it comes to environmental matters , and the environmental considerations of energy generation are self-evident and considerable . #% Environmental impacts of gear are a very important factor . #% What is right for Sweden is not the choice of others . #% We have already seen this on a number of different legislative fronts , both in the cooperation with Parliament and in the work with the Commission . #% I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget . #% The regulators failed . #% So let us have the study and then we can take the necessary decisions on this issue . #% The system is also acting as a deterrent to young people making a career in farming . #% I look forward to seeing full ratification by all 10 accession countries . #% The ruling elite has enriched itself fabulously , especially in the oil and gas industry , while 90 % of the population of Azerbaijan live in acute poverty and have seen no benefit from the natural resources of their country . #% Therefore , I believe we have set out in the wrong direction and I so not support the basic proposal that because there is stringency at national level , it should be applied here . #% There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act . #% Again I return to that point today . #% Madam President , it is very regrettable that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has voted to allow even higher levels of dioxins than the Commission had proposed , when you consider that dioxins are one of the most toxic substances known to man . #% SMEs in particular seem to be split on this issue . #% We have also requested that dual-use technology with a potential military application be excluded from this agreement . #% Therefore I am recommending a negative vote in relation to these areas . #% In 2009 , I had the privilege in becoming the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in Dundalk . #% The key issues for my Group at the first reading were basically the direct marketing of food on the farm or at local retailers and flexibility for the processing of traditional products . #% I would certainly prefer if the references to manipulation and culpability were amended . #% That is why we ascribe and subscribe to the International Criminal Court . #% Mr President , I would like to say briefly to Mr Cohn-Bendit that passion is a wonderful thing but if passion is not based on pragmatism and common sense , it is wasted . #% However , I also see the need for promoting the development of alternative technologies which are more environmentally benign than the existing ones . #% On reducing exhaust emissions from passenger cars , I support the proposal that systems be installed in new cars from the year 2000 onward to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment in passenger vehicles . #% 
Mr President , this is obviously an initial reaction , and clearly we are going to have to come back to this in more detail . #% If commitment is lacking , then enforcement measures need to be put in place . #% We need uniform measurement techniques across the EU , but we do not need common threshold values other than for nitrates and pesticides . #% The funding proposal for information policy is very positive , and the multiannual programme is a very practical proposal : it makes it easier for Member States and that is to be welcomed , as are the joint programmes by two Member States or border regions . #% Of course , this is all set against the continuing crisis in the eurozone , as each day goes by evidencing the folly of the single currency model . #% We should not be discussing a sensitive question , such as this beef issue , on the hoof . #% As a Member of the European Parliament representing the east coast of Ireland , I am particularly angered by the extent of shipments of nuclear waste within the Irish Sea . #% Since I have lived all of my life in the countryside and have been actively involved in farming and the politics of farming , I fully sympathise with those farmers and their families who were devastated by the outbreak . #% The microfinance facility is another piece in the jigsaw where the EU , in this case , is trying to ensure access to micro-credit for those who would not be able to access that credit from what we might define as the normal or usual financial institutions . #% That Treaty retained the principle of a common agricultural policy agreed in 1957 , including the article which states that EU policy is to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community , in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture . #% The objective is to protect the democratic prerogatives of the European Parliament , as provided for in the Lisbon Treaty . #% A split second can change our lives , and the challenge is to save lives and to preserve health . #% I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China . #% We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest , public services , to survive and to prosper , and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe . #% The full impact of the radioactive fall-out on human health is still being assessed , and I do not believe adequately assessed . #% Indeed , CRAs played a significant role in the build-up to the financial crisis through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments . #% The European Union has brought forward proposals to prevent our financial systems being used for money-laundering to fund terrorist activities . #% Please do not take me seriously but I really am frustrated with the way we are headed . #% Air transport has become an integral part of society , allowing us to travel long distances quickly , but also strengthening Europe 's integration , prosperity and political importance . #% Violence against women knows no geographical boundaries , no age limit , no class or race or cultural distinctions , but it is still invisible and the victims are silenced . #% Can the President-in-Office assure us that , in the new Treaty following the IGC , the rights of children will be given the just , legal weight they deserve ? #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Macartney on his report . #% Mr President , I thank the Commission for raising this important issue for animals and humans . #% This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold . #% To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Ireland 's policy of having no age limit on gambling with the state-run tote . #% Visiting the peripheral regions of my own constituency which have traditionally depended on fishing , I have very little to offer them . #% Like everybody else , I compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Krehl . #% I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for ` the blessed peace of the single bed ' , to quote George Bernard Shaw . #% As more and more Members come into the Chamber , I would like to announce a welcome innovation . #% Unfortunately , since my last exchange with you , my worst fears have been realised with the closure of one of our two sugar factories in Ireland and the loss of the jobs that the factory provided . #% For example , subject to overall budget constraints , we believe taxation on the lower paid should be reduced . #% We have much to learn from them . #% You can give the leadership but that leadership requires compromise and consensus . #% This was a momentous occasion in European history , finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War . #% My reason for rising here today is to welcome those participating in the freedom drive to the European Parliament . #% I wish to pay tribute to the Italian presidency . #% I think it is appalling that vested interests within governments and countries are totally disregarding the health of people throughout Europe . #% I would appreciate it if the President would convey my comments to the Commission President . #% It is a very serious matter . #% Another example comes from the Pacific Ocean , where the regional body , the IATTC , has succeeded in dramatically reducing certain types of by-catch , namely dolphins . #% Fears of discrimination are not myths in Northern Ireland , they are stubborn facts . #% Instead we should direct our energy and resources to bringing stability to the sector , restoring consumer confidence in food and investing in promotion and market development . #% The Commission must modify its draft agreement text to ensure that European citizens ' data protection rights are protected . #% Mr President , there is no doubt that liberalisation of the transport market has delivered positive benefits for the mobility of goods and people , but this is in the context of a continuing predominance of road traffic , growing congestion and harmful effects on the environment and public health . #% There should be no undue influence using European taxpayers ' money to promote propaganda forcing people to vote in favour of the Treaty . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group , I wish warmly to congratulate our colleague John Hume on the recognition which has been given to him for his courage , consistency of analysis and on the way he has persevered politically and personally over many , long , trying years in Northern Ireland . #% Young farmers have computers . #% Our overseas markets are seriously threatened and we have only one case of it . #% Let us ensure that all new legislation is crime-proof and existing legislation is evaluated . #% Hundreds of jobs will be lost . #% The European Union is doing its part . #% At a time of acute pressure on our health service and vital education sector , it is appalling that we are wasting so much taxpayers ' money on a failing political union . #% I also support the idea of an international peace conference bringing together all the actors in the Middle East , including Syria and Iran . #% The UN report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the Tamil people . #% I would seek an assurance that the Commission will enquire into this and ask the Chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment . #% It is right for us to encourage competition but the timing , elements and basics have to be right . #% Technical measures assume an even greater importance in the likely event that the Council will not adopt a rigorous programme to reduce fleet capacity . #% The Treaty of Nice could mean that a number of Member States could decide to go ahead with a nuclear-armed force even though other states do not agree . #% It is right for Parliament to have oversight and the Commission should not fear any involvement of Parliament in that vein . #% The Left 's resolution also points out that illegal logging is related to poverty levels in the countries concerned . #% The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America . #% Is he aware that his colleague , Mr Cunningham , gave an undertaking to Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that he was prepared to have the matter re-examined ? #% I think one of the biggest dangers that we face for the future is that we have failed our citizens and failed our people in terms of telling them exactly how successful Europe has been , how good it has been for them not only in peace , stability and prosperity , but also in bringing about political stability , in ensuring equality between men and women , in guaranteeing minimum rights for workers , minimum rights for people who are most in need and most at risk within our societies . #% One of the most important aspects of this report that I want to raise is the whole issue of the distance of landfill sites from residential areas . #% We need to clamp down on sexual exploitation of children . #% Mr President , you would be perfectly right . #% 
But we should not pull down the good structures and leave our farmers and their families on their own . #% Too often in the past EU Member States have allowed themselves to be blackmailed by China . #% It is pointless to argue that a self-employed driver might be less fatigued than an employed driver . #% Here , in the European Union we have the problem of decommissioning our nuclear facilities at our Joint Research Centre . #% Naturally there is a need to reassure customers by providing adequate protection from real and proven risks and by keeping them informed . #% There is one thing about the Commission 's proposals which I would question : why all the emphasis on tonnage if we have a quota policy which is working ? #% Despite the meagre resources at its disposal it does an exceptionally excellent job . #% I believe that enlargement should proceed with all speed so that the accession countries can not only share in the benefits of European Union membership , but also contribute fully to the debate on the kind of European Union we hope to build . #% I have tabled amendments to that effect . #% The money will be used to re-train workers , help start businesses and provide people with job placements , which are very necessary . #% It effectively exempts Dell from facing the social consequences of its strategy and allows companies to engage in a race to the bottom supported by both Member State and EU funds . #% Regrettably that proviso did not appear in any part of yesterday 's article , nor in quotations . #% Irish troops have a proud record of serving in peace-keeping and humanitarian missions abroad under the auspices of United Nations mandates and the Irish people want this to continue to be the case in the future . #% in writing . - I support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register . #% We need a broad perspective , not one which focuses only on accessibility in education . #% They stimulate , and are a major source of , job creation . #% We have to live and earn a living in these places . #% That , I am afraid , is exactly what is happening in Gaza . #% Mr President , I wish to welcome Mr Quinn here to the European Parliament and to congratulate him on the seriousness and skill of his efforts to date to work himself into the whole business of organizing the affairs of the Union for the next six months . #% It is as well to remember that in June 1996 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive of guarantees for consumer goods and after-sales services . #% Mr President , if I had an hour instead of a minute I could maybe touch on some of the key points , however , in the European Parliament we have to work within these limits . #% Let us work with real issues not with esoteric issues concerning political point-scoring . #% Mr President , we live in a European Union in which an internal market operates and where there is free movement of goods , persons , services and capital . #% It is very good to welcome a former colleague into a new elevated office but let me remind you Mr Moscovici , of the frustration which we experienced as parliamentarians trying to question the Council . #% In these circumstances , using minorities , including gay people , as scapegoats is a standard , cynical way to divert attention from the failures of the establishment . #% Structured dialogue only takes place with the associated states . #% UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency should return to Iraq at the earliest opportunity and complete their mission . #% I ask you please to consult with the European Central Bank and European Investment Bank and try to bring your influence to bear to get us back to traditional bank managers who engage with SMEs and help them to develop their businesses . #% I have to say that the response , not only from the government , but also from the people , was heroic . #% I would appreciate a Commission response . #% The six Commissioners with whom we had dealings satisfied us as to their future competence in the roles which they will undertake . #% No matter what part of a country one lived in one got the same level of service at the same cost as everybody else . #% Therefore I welcome the initiatives from the discussion of structural funds and employment opportunities at the Madrid informal Council in December 1995 to the final communication in March 1996 . #% How can the Presidency commend the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the mission when it was fully aware that we never received a formal invitation from the authorities and that they also refused to sign a memorandum of understanding , including an agreement to provide security cover . #% By far the worst , of course , and not surprising , is Spain with 116 vessels , but of course they are not alone . #% The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law with a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced . #% The first step is a comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen binding the international community to mandatory reductions and providing for sanctions at international level for non-compliance . #% I am extremely surprised by the Commissioner 's response and I can only characterize it as gobbledygook . #% I want to lobby unashamedly for the European anti-poverty network . #% Therefore maintaining people in rural areas and in peripheral areas of the European Union is a better way of encouraging more tourism to those areas . #% I congratulate all parties in this process in reaching agreement to protect stricter laws in countries like Denmark , and in issues of labelling . #% It is in families that children learn the values of ` peace , dignity , tolerance , freedom , equality and solidarity ' ( preamble ) , as well as the skills necessary to implement these values in society throughout their lives . #% That perhaps demonstrates that the extent of the crimes was unbelievable to us at the time and that the law was not adequate to deal with them . #% If we are going to insist on retrospective labelling , how will they be able to compete ? #% A couple of years ago we took away the possibility of extending assistance to people in such instances in the European Union . #% The risk of nuclear proliferation is greater during transportation than at any other stage in the fuel cycle . #% We in Ireland seem to have no say in this . #% We should be a beacon of hope and tranquillity for those who wish to have their viewpoint heard . #% For ten stocks they adopted an increase where the Commission had recommended a decrease . #% However , I want to concentrate on just one area where we can act , and that is the low-level presence of unauthorised GMOs in feed imports and its impact on the EU feed industry , because this is an over-arching issue . #% I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long , cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland . #% There is serious questioning in the scientific community about the possibility of speeding up vaccine production because of contamination risks . #% The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so , ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members , not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering . #% The adoption of this strategy will allow for cost-effective , value-added development of new and innovative solutions , and so I supported this proposal . #% We chose to abstain and this requires explanation . #% These responsibilities lie primarily with the Member States and it is time , as I said , that we assumed our responsibility not only for the health of our population today , but for the protection of our environment for tomorrow 's generations as well . #% Those that enforce the rule of law must always operate within the law . #% The main applications are in the building sector ( 57 % of total use ) , packaging , household appliances and cars . #% There is no equity in that . #% Mr President , I fully endorse this excellent report by the rapporteur Mr Bowis , but I feel that little justice can be done to the topic of major neglected diseases in developing countries in just two minutes . #% I would like to see private operators exempted from the scope of this directive . #% Very often this fear of the loss of a child results in an abduction . #% Interventions should target low-income households , as defined by the national legislation in force . #% I urge Catherine Ashton during her upcoming visit to the region to press the Israeli and Palestinian authorities , including those in Gaza , for the release of Gilad Shalit and of Palestinian children and PLC members and to ensure their safe and early return to their families . #% I asked if the Commission was planning to review current priority or non-priority road projects within the trans-European networks framework so as to give preference to more sustainable transport modes . #% We know that the key brake on this expansion is the lack of confidence , particularly amongst consumers . #% 
For me , criminal justice matters are intrinsically national issues and must remain so . #% The research is ambiguous . #% The growing support for a FTT must be driven hard by public opinion for governments to act , and not to cave in to the people for whom greed is not enough . #% There are currently 37 different chapters of negotiation to be discussed between the Union and the new applicant countries . #% This is exactly what the Dalai Lama has reiterated today to be his approach and that of the Tibetan people . #% I would like to conclude by not only congratulating the Danish Presidency once again and welcoming the fact that its confidence proved to be right , but also by wishing it a similar success at the Copenhagen Council . #% No other Commissioner was subjected to this ordeal and it is bitterly resented by those of us who wanted to do this thing properly and to objectively listen to what Commissioners would say about their future work . #% Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market . #% This was a really dishonest question , because the funds go into the reserve and they are used for purposes such as HIV . #% We are fortunate to have people who give so freely of their time . #% I hope that is not the case here . #% Each of us is fully aware that junior doctors in training carry out tasks which are virtually the same as those carried out by their so-called `` masters '' , the consultants . #% National authorities will encourage the widening of treatment programmes . #% I know these are early days , which is a genuine caveat for anything we say after what has been a very short 18-month review period . #% However , there is a growing dissatisfaction among air travellers with regard to the quality of service which they are receiving from many airlines within the EU . #% Mr President , Commissioner , you have listed a lot of very worthy projects . #% As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity . #% Some very important aspects have been included , as many other people have mentioned . #% It is to be hoped that as we move towards the creation of defence structures , we will not forget the importance of conflict prevention , and also of continued investment in our policy on democratisation and human rights , because it is abuses in those areas that give rise to conflict in many parts of the world . #% From some of the speeches this morning and our discussions over the last week that if you have experience in business or politics , if you have strongly held beliefs , if you have a strong ideology , if you have a strong opinion , then , according to some , you are not suitable to be a Commissioner of the European Union . #% There are four main reasons for this and most of them have already been mentioned . #% On 18 February another woman in the Community won her case in the European Court of Human Rights - Denise Mathews v. the UK Government . #% Finally , a word on procedure . #% We held three dialogues and several meetings at technical level , both on the contentious issues of delegated acts . #% It is genetic , its infectious , its degenerative , but there are very , very few cases , given , for example , the number of BSE cases in the UK in the cattle herd . #% There are provisions in the Nice Treaty meaning that once these countries are full Member States of the EU , they can be sanctioned . #% As far as I can tell there is no plan to do anything at all and that is disgraceful . #% Very close to our hearts in the Parliament , was the emphasis on the need for community involvement and good government in order to improve the working of local democracy . #% But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel . #% In my view , nothing can be done without bringing both minorities along . #% We have to ensure that lawyers , who are an essential part of any effective and credible system of justice , are allowed to conduct their professional duties without any hindrances or fear of intimidation or worse . #% I know there is a lot of rubbish but there are some very good ideas . #% I am particularly interested in the issue of a central registry where all children abducted - whether they are parental or criminal abductions - will be notified and action taken . #% The top tier of the army , however , is deeply tied to the economic interests of the former regime and does not represent the legitimate demands and aspirations of the working people . #% Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there . #% REACH can provide that guarantee and information , but we must be careful not to destroy these industries as well . #% It is paramount for the future of bioenergy increase that this increase should not jeopardise European or third countries ' ability to achieve environmental priorities , such as halting the loss of biodiversity , protecting forests , preventing soil degradation and achieving the good ecological status of its water body . #% For example , in Northern Ireland our milk production industry is heavily reliant on export refunds available on whole-milk powder . #% The proposal that there should be a full-time President of the European Council has the potential to undermine both the role of both the President of the Commission and the Foreign Minister . #% in writing . - The incoming Swedish Presidency has many challenges but the greatest is the need to ensure that the EU respects the sovereignty of the Member States and does not ride roughshod over the democratic rights of the peoples of Europe . #% We need to exclude the exportation of waste and indeed , as has already been said , the timetable is way out of line with what the Member States can achieve . #% I have already thanked Mr Collins in his absence for his kind words earlier and I appreciate his introductory remarks . #% People deserve to have their health protected and not have the ball kicked into touch for a scientific investigation that may take years . #% We need to foster cooperation between the Member States and get common approaches to share problems and opportunities and get a better balanced development with an integrated approach across the sectors . #% However Parliament 's report also shows the cost to the exchequer as it is estimated that the cost to society of gender-based violence - in the form of spending on healthcare , the legal system and social services - is EUR 2 million per hour in total in all EU Member States . #% The pragmatists are those who know what can be attained and have to endure the frustration when this is less than they would like . #% The Czech Prime Minister said on a radio interview shortly afterwards , and I quote directly from what he said , ' I again repeat those words were not uttered publicly , nevertheless they have not been embargoed . ' #% That is why the proposal for a biofuels directive is also to be welcomed . #% The problem next year will be Brazil : they have streamlined their approval system down to 22 months , and the problem will not go away . #% At this time the blockade is spreading and nothing seems to be being done by either the British Government or the Commission . #% For these small-scale farmers , who one would have considered unfortunate enough not to have secured some type of part-time work , the option of work on state sponsored schemes became available . #% I wish to welcome the President-in-Office and wish him well during the course of the Irish presidency . #% There have already been disastrous floods in Portugal , Spain , Somalia and Mexico this year . #% It happens - and this is a new dimension to our relationship with these countries - that the three prisoners I mentioned have relations in Ireland and , because of the interaction between voluntary organisations in Ireland and Kosovo , pressure is being put on me as an MEP to find a solution to this problem . #% Article 175 will also allow those Member States which already have more ambitious legislation in force as part of their Kyoto strategy to keep that legislation where it is appropriate for the functioning of the internal market and not , as would be the case with the current common position , force them to bring their environmental standards down to lower EU levels . #% Mr President , this evening we will identify what are probably the two make-or-break issues for the next WTO round in Cancun - TRIPS and public health and agriculture . #% I hope Minister Noel Tracy takes this up urgently and all Member States ensure smooth administration of arrangements for finalising the PEACE 11 funding , and guarantee continuing funding for a PEACE 111 programme for 2007-2013 . #% Nevertheless , they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty . #% I believe that this will have an impact on the convergence objectives of the funds . #% Do you anticipate that he will give direct reports to the relevant parliamentary committee on a regular basis ? #% This Parliament , through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Almeida Garrett report , pointed out that there was a need to amend that statute , because at the moment , Article 3 ( 2 ) imposes restrictions in terms of the Ombudsman 's investigative powers and , as it is currently worded , denies access to documents which can be refused on duly substantiated grounds of secrecy and accuracy . #% The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations . #% It is extremely disappointing that a country like Nigeria , which is the eighth-largest producer of oil in the world , has such a large proportion of the population living below the poverty line . #% There is a further consequence which links in with our debate here some time ago on the coming into operation of the Treaty of Amsterdam , that is the question of employment . #% My understanding from the briefings I have received is that there is a requirement to have such ships dealt with within a period of 180 days . #% Indeed , the UK vice tax has only encouraged this worrying pattern of companies establishing themselves overseas and thus avoiding the need to apply for a UK licence . #% 
An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80 % of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States , while the Commission has final responsibility . #% This was not finally accepted until the WHO Conference in Geneva last year when the findings of the thyroid project , based in Minsk , were adopted . #% The carbon footprint left behind by this form of global trading is colossal . #% I deplore the proposed cutbacks by the European Council in funding for SMEs at a time when this is supposed to be a central plank in the EU 's action to combat unemployment . #% We need to reform the way in which we take decisions in a broader European Community , but we also need to ensure that , in the context of putting in place a new European Union Treaty , vital national interests are protected . #% Regarding SMEs , I hope that the Commission 's aim of funding large projects , while understandable , does not mean the exclusion of smaller projects which are more likely to be placed in smaller , peripheral Member States which are nonetheless in great need of help and support in this area . #% That will not be known for certain until this matter is heard in a court of law . #% I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection , David Byrne , in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet . #% We have different regional experiences ; we have different needs and capacities ; we have different sectors in terms of technological development and the weight of that development by sector ; and the current report , in terms of what is sets out as a future scenario and development of thinking , allows for a reflection on diversity and building on that diversity . #% It is not in the interests of the European Union to bring in legislation that will put people at a disadvantage and make the European Union look like kill-joys . #% Parliament does not want , or need , to be involved in micro-management , but it does give us an opportunity , through whatever structures we decide ourselves , to get involved at an early stage , thereby giving Parliament a much improved role in the whole area of transparency and accountability . #% It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation . #% I appreciate the spirit of the question and I am sure it is one we all share . #% I was accredited with not being present in this House to record my vote when , in actual fact , I was here but my card was faulty . #% In conclusion , we have listed the problems , but what are the causes ? #% It is vital that the governments now support the EP 's recommendations in the EU Social Affairs Council on 2 December . #% We in the European Union , along with the United Nations , all encouraged the East Timorese to exercise their right to vote in the referendum . #% That system has decided in its wisdom that the public -- the ordinary citizens -- whose lives will be immediately and permanently affected by certain environmental decisions can not be trusted to participate in and influence such important decisions . #% Some of the concerns that have been expressed here tonight , particularly about dealing with illegal content and consumer acceptance , need to be being already pursued by the Commission before we adopt this fully as a European directive . #% This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens . #% I want to ask him whether he believes that by-products of the European forestry industry have a potentially important role to play in the future in providing renewable energy sources . #% The recent case in Scotland which has re-endorsed the International Court ' s ruling that nuclear weapons are illegal is also interesting and has to be taken on board . #% It has been of immense advantage to my own country , Ireland and I know it will continue to be , in the future , a powerhouse for the citizens of Europe . #% None of us disagree with that . #% However , I believe that parts of this resolution , rather than bringing clarity to the rules , will only serve to confuse the general public and in particular funding operators . #% Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape . #% The degree of energy wasted by the political leaders of Europe in trying to foist an unwanted Constitution on our people is quite staggering . #% Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion . #% A new equilibrium must be established on the basis of a true partnership in which both parties shape the agreed policy objectives . #% This is an excellent initiative and I fully endorse the goal of highlighting the educational value of sport . #% It is an excellent report and I support the call on Commissioner Bonino to initiate an information campaign dealing specifically with the difficulties of the introduction of the euro into the consumer 's pocket in the year 2002 . #% deputising for the author . - Mr President , firstly , I want to say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague , Alain Cadec , who was to be the speaker here this afternoon . #% The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution and that is something we tend to forget . #% We also find it very alarming that incineration , which we consider detrimental to the environment , has actually now been included as something to aim for . #% I would hope that the arrangements on surveillance on monitoring which operated in the tuna fishery in 1995 ensured that most of the difficulties of previous years were eliminated . #% It is also important that a strong culture of openness and cooperation exists between the Commission , the national , regional and local authorities . #% I would urge Commissioner Kovács , in relation to taxation , that ` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' and above all ` do n't break it ' ! #% High exposure can cause severe lung , prostate and kidney cancer . #% We have brought the document as far as we can with the Commission , but I would say that , if we vote for it today , you must immediately instruct our Committee on Constitutional Affairs to take up the question of delineating the rules in the House that will make it easier for rapporteurs to make requests either of their chairmen or of the other bodies named in this document . #% In the industrial and service sector such a cut would never be accepted but farmers are expected to put up with the vagaries of world market prices which are currently at rock bottom across a range of commodities . #% Evidence shows that women are currently benefiting considerably from the provisions already in force within the UK , 9 out of 10 women taking the 20 weeks maternity leave , as well as 3 in 4 women taking all their paid leave . #% The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States . #% In reply to queries from my political group , the Commission recently confirmed that the last time it undertook such an audit was in 1993 , nearly a decade ago . #% We know only too well the cycle of violence , the tit -- for -- tat , the eye for an eye . #% Indeed I welcome the presence this morning of President Barroso on this important issue . #% I met with a disability group when I was there last year , and everything pointed to the fact that people with disabilities like Down 's Syndrome are simply eliminated before or after birth . #% It must also be put on the record that from the moment of the first suspected case of BSE in my country we implemented a full-herd slaughter programme . #% The reality is that new information technologies are changing all the time . #% Mr President , as we tabled this resolution to the committee oral question , we want to make it clear in the title that it is the G7 proposal for the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear power reactors in Ukraine . #% There is little point in being all things to all people at all times . #% Let us sit down , come to the Fisheries Committee , listen to the officials , listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility . #% US President Reagan was famously quoted as saying about Saddam Hussein `` he ' s a sonofabitch , but he ' s our sonofabitch '' . #% While I welcome the personal guarantee given by Chief Secretary Donald Tsang that he will not allow the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens to be undermined , this must be reflected in the proposed legislation . #% The Commission 's lack of activity since 1989 in respect of BSE must rank as one of the greatest failures of public administration in recent history . #% Madam President , this is not a very suitable subject to deal with through urgency . #% There are many instances in my area where maybe BSE occurred five , six or seven years ago in one animal and there has never been another case since . #% It must now sit down with the Commission and examine the eradication programme and adopt a set of measures to eradicate BSE and restore consumer confidence . #% Can we not invite him ? #% With any model of social dialogue and social partnership , rights are devolved to the social partners to negotiate , consult and come up with framework agreements which should be implemented on a European basis . #% It is not only a question of dealing with the rights of European Union citizens working in different European Union countries , it is equally about formulating common policies to deal with people who seek to enter the European Union as asylum-seekers or refugees , or those who fall into the bracket of economic migrants . #% This report has all the integrity that is expected of this Parliament . #% The criteria which are used by these ecolabels must be publicly available to all who are interested , and must be detailed and specific . #% Shifting the finishing line and imposing onerous time constraints at this stage would display a lack of good faith on our part as it unscrambles the hard-won result of the final trialogue on the revised directive earlier this year , as outlined in recital 6 to that directive , which I understood to list , for each new Member State , the date relating to the derogation . #% In that regard , I just want to read out a letter from the State Prosecutor in Belgium : ' In reply to your letter of 10 June 1997 , 020211 , I hereby inform you that a criminal investigation is under way into matters , including the possible misappropriation of funds belonging to Belgian public works contractors which took part in the construction of the European Parliament 's property complex in Brussels D1 , D2 and D3 buildings . #% This is something that certainly needs to be studied . #% ` Bushmeat ' or ` wild meat ' describes the food product of wild animals , whether consumed locally or traded commercially . #% 
The amendments which I tabled to Mr Jarzembowski ' s and Mr Swoboda ' s reports aimed at restoring the equilibrium established by the common position . #% In many countries , for example , there are payroll taxes which contribute to the level of unemployment . #% In the lead-in to decimalization the importance of establishing a high degree of consumer confidence was perhaps not fully understood . #% I also hope we can move away from the adversarial approach on environmental issues between environmental groups and key business communities . #% If the Treaty is ratified in the proper way , if Parliament is properly consulted and gives its assent , then of course we have an obligation to meet the spending . #% Policies will have to be developed which are capable of generating economic growth and new jobs for the millions of unemployed ; of tackling international crime and drug smuggling ; of settling the difficult question of the future funding of Europe from the year 2000 onwards and of moving forward with the single currency project . #% I unreservedly condemn the atrocities carried out by both sides in this conflict . #% The IAEA at their conference in Vienna last week still deny these findings , although the Ukrainian , Russian and Belarussian delegations dispute their figures . #% For example , an organization in Ireland called ASH estimates that the tobacco industry and its appalling campaign to ensure that more and more young people take up smoking kill six times more people in Ireland each year than road accidents , work accidents , drugs , murder , suicide and AIDS . #% The entry into force of this directive is therefore postponed and Member States can postpone compliance with Article 9 until 2006 . #% And you handed over the working class of Greece and the poor of Greece to the tender mercies of these parasites - criminals in fact . #% In recent events in the Congo , approximately 50 000 people have been victims of the use of light weapons . #% To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong . #% Finally , as this is likely to be my last contribution in this House , I want to acknowledge the success of the European project . #% The Commission has consistently discharged its functions as guarantor of the European Treaties in an exemplary fashion . #% Sinn Féin supports those communities in Ireland fighting against the imposition of dangerous incinerators onto their communities . #% We have faced up to the importance of food security and food quality and we must also ensure that our consumers are fully protected in the broader world trade . #% We do not want continuous , ad hoc structures . #% Finally , I would urge the Irish authorities to address , without further delay , the deficiency we have with regard to recycling facilities and also the fact that in Ireland agricultural waste is not considered waste , and so we have the spectacle of beautiful lakes - like the lakes of Killarney - being full of phosphates and so on and fish being killed because agricultural effluent is going into these lakes . #% These stocks are a major target of the large important artisanal fisheries sector and the fishermen are very worried about the impact this will have on their livelihood and the food supplies of the coastal villages . #% Only last week , as has already been mentioned , we saw the horrific murder of one of Ireland 's foremost investigative journalists , Veronica Guerin . #% We also need more adequate training for our lawyers and for our judges . #% It is a testament to their abilities and initiatives that there was such overwhelming support for the positions that they took . #% However , my major concern arises because of the existence of a strong eurosceptic core at the heart of the Irish government . #% Even though Amina Lawal would have the right to appeal her verdict before a non-religious court , she has suffered enough . #% In his New Year message , speaking to his own people in his own state , he set out as one of his three objectives to work for the creation of a federal Europe . #% All too often the real movers and shakers in this area are the NGOs who are , invariably , inadequately funded and constantly knocking on the door to try and bring these issue to the public . #% We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006 , and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct . #% It is more difficult to put in place the legislative framework to allow for this to happen . #% This will not be done by the corrupt local elites , nor by European multinational corporations whose key motivation is private profit , but by the forestry workers and the indigenous peoples themselves taking democratic ownership of their resources . #% I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later . #% If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world , we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem . #% The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes . #% Our police , the Royal Ulster Constabulary , has had 302 of its members savagely murdered and 8 700 of its members brutally maimed . #% There are eleven participating countries within the new euro currency zone encompassing over 291 million people . #% Mr President , I share the views of the majority of the speakers here this afternoon that the collapse of the talks was a major blow , both to the WTO itself and to the global economy . #% This is discriminatory and needs to change . #% However , when the banks came begging , most governments , including the Irish Government , were only too quick to provide them with billions in taxpayers ' money . #% There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field . #% I am glad that we are having this debate today if only to raise this issue again . #% The other is economic . #% Mr President , after the rejections of the Constitution , the Prime Minister rightly said that profound questions now arose about the future of Europe . #% Our public services should be seen as mechanisms for social protection . #% Firstly with regard to education and training , whether it is lifelong learning , the upskilling of existing skills or providing new skills to people . #% This is as true for Ireland as it is for every Member State . #% I welcome the recent decision on fining Greece and I would like to see the same thing happen with the Irish government if they fail to comply with directives . #% That does not prevent us from maintaining a critical perspective , with regard to the seriousness of the ETA organisation 's commitment to making the necessary compromises . #% Mr President , on behalf of this House , I ask you to convey your sympathy and commiserations to the family of Mrs Jean McConville , whose remains were accidentally found in the last week or so . #% Education must always be a priority of spending programmes as it is the way in which we build the future . #% As I have already said , the early resolution of the case and the dropping of the charges obviated the need for such action as we intended to take . #% Currently , the laws exist in most countries but are simply not being enforced . #% This would mean a reduction in the EU budget over time . #% First there is the universal service aspect - the universal obligation that my colleague Malcolm Harbour was talking about . #% The draft Constitution represents a bottom line compromise . #% I am not so sure . #% I hope I am not listening to the creation of a convention , which will be a sort of pub with no beer . #% I am afraid I ran out of my office with the wrong file under my arm and had to go back for the correct one . #% The Conference of Presidents assumes that the committee will then wish to incorporate any of the relevant observations and conclusions into its proper , ordinary work which serves this House so well . #% I say to the Commission : questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme . #% Fourthly , to try and anticipate , if that is possible , where we need to move in the future . #% I agree with Mr Poettering when he said that those who have been waging that war and taking those lives should not be rewarded for bringing an end to that now . #% As a general political philosophy I support the whole concept of enterprise and competitiveness and the need to reward effort and initiative and that has to be at the core of job creation . #% They are the victims of animal-feed manufacturers who use meat and bone meal in bovine feed and there is some evidence , regrettably , to suggest that unscrupulous manufacturers have continued to use the product since the new regulations were introduced . #% Parliament has already addressed this equitable right to participate with its reference to the position of countries with small audiovisual capacity . #% Last weekend , a large demonstration in Hong Kong illustrated the genuine concerns that Article 23 laws could undermine existing human rights and civil and religious liberties . #% We know it generally deals with major infrastructure projects where levels of security are very high and each project 's timescale is measured over many years . #% 
On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to lay particular emphasis on our distress at the code of secrecy rather than the code of transparency normally promoted by the Council . #% It is in every fisherman 's interest that future stocks are protected and , if we must have controls , then let the industry be part of the decision-making process . #% However , I could not support the overall report because of the inclusion of issues which I believe to be , and indeed are , matters of subsidiarity - that is , the competence of the Member State - and therefore not issues about which the European Parliament should adopt a view . #% Obviously , we would not want to have guaranteed prices and intervention and export refunds . #% This is one of the insufferable burdens of EU membership and a salutary warning against the increasing Brussels ' control which the new Constitution would bring upon us , given the socio-economic dogma which it contains in Part III . #% The kind of detailed work that is involved in this kind of directive is never adequately appreciated outside of this House . #% in writing . - Mr Hegyi 's own-initiative report emphasises the importance of the protection of wilderness areas in Europe in the application of existing Directives , proposing a definition of ` wilderness ' as still untouched areas as well as ` areas where human activities are minimal ' . #% It is now up to us in this Parliament and future presidencies to develop them further . #% I would like to thank my colleagues , Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Poignant for all their hard work on these sister ( or in this case brother ) reports and in drawing up sensible conclusions for improved safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries servicing European ports and domestic voyages within Member States . #% I will continue to defend the most vulnerable in this field - the small operators and those who enjoy flying as a sport . #% They have now been submitted to Geneva to be considered , along with the proposals of the other members of the World Trade talks , including the United States , the Cairns Group and the developing countries . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , since we are on the subject of milk quotas , I want to bring a serious situation to the Commissioner 's attention . #% Lessons have to be learnt from this tragedy . #% Today when we speak about Chernobyl and the nuclear industry , the two go hand in hand . #% I deprecate the installation of nuclear power in some countries where the culture and the requirements for such potentially dangerous forms of energy are not available . #% Would you ask the President to invite the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to consider a change to the Rules so we can check it electronically ? #% We have beautiful offices , fully equipped . #% Unfortunately the taxpayer will have to pay the fines but real pressure has to be put on the government at this stage because they have got away with it for far too long . #% I am at a loss to understand how such transcripts of a criminal nature can be published . #% We must draw a line under that and we must make sure that during the lifetime of the next Parliament and during the mandate of the Prodi Commission we actually bring about the reality of the first enlargement to the East . #% I feel extremely European after hearing more or less the same speech in 11 different languages , albeit with some differences of emphasis and with different views , clearly , on nuclear matters . #% I know that if I speak to my constituents , they will give little support to the current spending on Galileo , let alone an increase . #% Of course , there is also a knock-on effect in terms of impact and job creation and in population retention in rural areas . #% This must be seen as a new and worrying development . #% Be it the IRA fire-bombing a packed hotel outside Belfast and incinerating a dozen innocent people , al-Qa ` ida attacking the twin towers , or Chechen extremists in Beslan butchering innocent children , the strategy is the same -- maximum impact through maximum carnage in the hope of extracting maximum political concession . #% Lastly , European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality , the environment , and animal health and welfare . #% What colleagues have said about skin cancer is absolutely true . #% Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , I represent a country which has a unique and close historical relationship with the United States . #% Looking at what we have before us , I have to say to you , Commissioner , that the present situation can not continue . #% The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees . #% I am very pleased to see the Commissioner here . #% We do not need to create even more paperwork and administrative hassle for already beleaguered farmers . #% All these issues are closely interlinked , particularly in the case of existing net beneficiary countries , such as Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland , and those countries with significant agricultural sectors , such as France . #% We need to make sure that when it comes to the discharge of the 2008 budget , significantly more progress is made . #% I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging . #% I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank Gérard Caudron very much for his work as well as , of course , Commissioner Busquin . #% If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it . #% Mr President , the momentum building behind green energy , combined with the pressure on traditional agriculture , unite to offer agricultural production for non-food purposes as an alternative for some , as they consider necessary diversification . #% It should also be emphasised that each of us has an obligation to contribute to the blood supply on a voluntary basis , as it is essential to maintain these services for all . #% But I am not for adopting cosmetic exercises . #% It is wise for the Commission to have chosen the route of allowing some margin of manoeuvre and thereby trying to encourage Member States in their efforts to make these maps more consistent . #% However , I deplore the cynical manner in which the Irish Government has chosen to divide the country into regions for party-political purposes , with scant regard for the aim of structural funds which was to assist with economic and social cohesion . #% In other words , given the particular problems surrounding the proving of homeopathy as against allopathic medicine , the pecular requirements of homeopathy should be taken into consideration in this testing and the expert knowledge of homeopaths applied . #% I would commend to the House an examination of the Irish Government 's programme on local development which is an effort to redistribute some of the wealth in such a way that it helps the poorest urban and rural communities . #% The difficulties that have arisen - in this instance in relation to Chad - reflect very clearly why . #% So we need to take proactive measures in regard to this . #% Mr President , I also want to say hello to the Taoiseach and thank him for his marvellous , spontaneous remarks here today . #% It has always failed to deal with the real issue , namely the closing-down of Sellafield . #% This is a direct result of the unforgivable spamming of our system by a certain Dr Rath of Germany , who appears to have considerable interests in the matter of vitamin therapy on which we are voting this morning . #% Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government 's actions are completely unacceptable : building a fence , occupying territory , breaching human rights , using repression . #% I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say this . #% We have a right to tell the Russians that we demand standards of them with regard to freedom of expression , freedom of accountability and the freedom and the security of human life when people question and challenge authority . #% I know that it is serious about sustainability of stocks . #% It can be done in international discussions . #% I know we have the ` push system ' and the ` pull system ' and so on , but what kind of criteria are laid down for the use of the data ? #% As Mrs Schroedter said , there was a unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy but I think she would also admit that was as a result of very substantial amendments tabled by many political groups , and , indeed , we have much more work to do in this area . #% Furthermore , where a small country is involved , we have been quick to criticise , but when the offender is a large country , such as China , our response has been much more muted and I very much welcome Commissioner Patten 's recent remarks in this regard . #% There will be difficulties ahead ; there are peace breakers on both sides who will try to derail this process . #% I am actually somewhat disappointed , because there seems to be a big difference between the rules for drivers of trucks transporting animals all the way to the Middle East , and the conditions that the animals themselves are kept in . #% Their task as guarantors of food security and quality is , as everyone in this House knows , becoming increasingly difficult . #% There is no sound reason why the shallow sand quarry should be subjected to the same legislative demands as the large , deep mine producing hazardous waste . #% The Nitrates Directive is certainly not doing this with 12 of the 15 Member States being taken to court over wrong or inadequate implementation . #% The agreement will show our support for progress . #% We have come a long way , as Mr Mulder knows , from the days when 80 % of the budget of the European Union was spent on agriculture . #% The importance of a vibrant European-based audiovisual industry can not be over-emphasised . #% However , I decided to abstain from the vote because the proposed Council directive does not take into account the dangerous effects of shipments and reprocessing of radioactive waste on nuclear-free Member States like Ireland . #% 
I believe that those who disagree with me have a right to their views . #% The message is obvious : consumers are happy to support Fair Trade . #% I believe that Mr Jacques Santer is a decent man . #% It has a huge diplomatic corps which reflects its colonial past . #% It was the first time that there was a formal meeting of defence ministers , and the decisions that were taken were historic . #% Commissioner , a sine qua non for the end of international terrorism , and thereby a more peaceful world order , is the cessation of hostilities between the Israelis and Palestinians . #% The European Parliament is not a court of law . #% Does the President-in-Office not agree that failure to lift the sanctions now is undermining the democratic foundations on which this Union was established ? #% Madam President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Bontempi on his report . #% Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well . #% I plead with you to intervene on her behalf so that she can be treated humanely and decently . #% I listened to the Commissioner with interest . #% The Berlin Summit of 25 March was a good summit . #% This is actually about protecting jobs that already exist and about protecting our environment and indeed our fishing industry . #% That is why it is important at this juncture in the European Parliament that when we speak about education we make sure that it is all-inclusive . #% This report is an important first step in making our citizens ' right to health protection , enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , a reality . #% This figure is far higher than the number of people killed in traffic accidents . #% It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well ! #% It is obvious to us all that the single market is just not working in this sector , especially when you look at the high cost of car insurance in my own country , Ireland . #% I believe that , in recent years , the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent . #% Federalist parties for federalist politicians might make some intellectual sense , but I would welcome a fight with them any day in my constituency . #% The decision was made to move ahead with this urgency on the Western Sahara through the normal and proper channels . #% This regulation will allow for housing renovation projects to draw on the ERDF but , in order to counter segregation risks , these initiatives must be part of a wider social integration framework in the fields of health , education and social affairs . #% On behalf of the Green Group , I went with the Committee on Fisheries last year to Morocco and the Moroccans were very clear : they did not want to sign the last agreement . #% Mr President , in the run-up to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Naples , pessimism about the likely outcome was evident . #% Judgement on the action of the Commission must be based on the circumstances at any given time . #% Are we in a position to respond to the needs of the industry and respond in time ? #% With oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage , we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient , by using more renewable energy , by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment . #% We must police and enforce this fully . #% The percentage of women elected to the European Parliament ranges from 58 % to 0 % , with an average slightly above 30 % . #% I am pleased that we are using tried and tested mechanisms of structural and cohesion funding to achieve that important goal . #% In fact , the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for US and British pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military-industrial complexes in both the US and Britain . #% Let our Member State governments get their act together in dealing with those children . #% I do not understand the problem . #% Mr President , I should just like to note for the record that this afternoon our colleague Mr James Moorhouse MEP joined the Liberal Democrats . #% The real issue is that we should set realistically attainable targets and timetables and insist on the Irish , Greeks , Portuguese and others delivering on time , with no excuses . #% In the area of smoking , legislators have come to recognise the significance of passive smoking and have taken measures to defend the people who are near the smoker . #% I call on the Irish Government to state clearly what position it will take on these issues before decisions are taken at Council . #% I doubt whether any Member State constitution has ever been prepared in such an open and democratic way . #% Even MEPs and representatives of the European Commission reportedly experienced intimidation and verbal aggression . #% The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers . #% This is a sector with a wealth of potential for expansion , for growth in the economy , for research and innovation and for tackling climate change . #% I welcome the fact that he has given a commitment that he will hold elections , but the international community must not allow him to turn his back on this commitment . #% The age profile of farmers is deteriorating and young people no longer see farming as a sustainable career . #% The Irish presidency will progress as far as possible the measures adopted by President Santer in support of job creation in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council . #% The second case pending against the Irish Government concerns the failure to supply the Commission with information on hazardous waste installations . #% We live in a world where half a million people move from a rural environment to an urban environment every single week . #% The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty . #% They also have some specific industrial applications in products as wide-ranging as microchips , fire-fighting foams , chromium plating and hydraulic fluids used in aviation . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , I condemn the brutal repression by the Thai Government and State against the protestors in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand . #% That is a serious issue . #% European Union taxpayers no longer want to see films on television documenting the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals . #% However , looking at what has been proposed , we are saying that priority should be given to non-chemical crop management , which everybody should welcome . #% That part of my question has not been answered . #% I also want to congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report . #% No action has been taken so far on any of the seven proposals which , as it happens , arose from a report which I had the privilege to introduce into this House . #% Mr Swoboda has called for more obvious public perception of our role in the area . #% I hope those Member States that abstained and displayed such openness will be persuaded to vote for the resolution when it comes before the General Assembly for a final vote next month . #% Madam President , this afternoon we have heard three very important statements on the core issue of this particular debate - one by the Council , one by the Commission and one by the chief observer on the European Union mission , who was officially representing the three institutions during the election itself . #% Charter flights are subject to great delays . #% Up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission . #% We should not have a report on which everyone in Europe has their say but the people who commissioned the report are not players in the field . #% The Treaty forms the basis for future discussions at the IGC , which will finalise the provisions of a new European Treaty . #% However , EU governments are going to have to hammer out an agreement as to how the rules governing economic and monetary union are going to operate into the future . #% Should incriminating evidence emerge , it goes without saying that the relevant procedures would be implemented . #% I am convinced that the Ryanair dispute in Ireland would have been solved long ago if this directive had been in place . #% 
We are not a mendicant seeking alms at the European door . #% That would be the best Christmas box that both the Commission and Council could give the citizens of Europe . #% It is supposed to be a common fisheries policy , therefore common rules and obligations should apply to all equally . #% This deal would result in major job losses at farm and industry level across rural areas in Ireland and the EU as a whole . #% And the societal implications include misuse , pornography , etc. , applications , health , education . #% I note what the honourable Member has said in his contribution . #% Another company much smaller , much bigger are paying considerably higher wages than Ryanair . #% Let us give meaningful expression to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which is the right to life . #% The effects of the full battle between the voluntary cooperation of the European sovereign states and the dictatorial incorporation of those states into the European superstate have yet to be witnessed . #% This is a problem we should be aware of in the European Union , with its share of world trade , with its economic weight in the world and with the political clout that it undoubtedly has . #% In a report designed to assess and support our young people in the best possible way , the deletion of reference to the family , the single most important influence in a young person ' s life , is incomprehensible . #% To give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons . #% As an Irish Member , I am all too aware that the overwhelming majority of environmental legislation , as well as attitude changes , are a direct result of our membership of the European Union . #% With regard to the various amendments that we have received , on Amendment No 1 I will be looking tomorrow for a split vote . #% The launch of the new euro currency will certainly help to reduce business costs for small and medium-sized enterprises as foreign exchange transactions in eleven countries become an event of the past . #% It is up to Russia to sort out its own political mess which has directly led to the country 's economic collapse . #% If the agreement is implemented , the EU will be violating international law and helping to prolong a conflict which has already lasted for 30 years . #% Its by-product , radioactive waste , is already a lethal threat to human health , effectively for ever . #% We need to work together on the second reading to ensure that this dangerous practice is stopped , and also to ensure that valuable European metals remain in Europe . #% The enduring environmental damage caused by the disaster demonstrates that Member States acting alone are under-resourced and ill-prepared to face such disasters . #% Mr President , the Commission 's decision concerning the commercial arrangements which Ryanair has with Charleroi airport is very misjudged . #% We not only did that but we sent back money every year which we saved with good budgetary policy . #% I welcome attempts to harmonise the management of packaging waste while recognising the high initial cost of putting in place schemes for recovery , recycling and sorting of waste . #% If there is a clear division , then there should be a free choice . #% I would certainly oppose any move towards renationalisation . #% We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes . #% Half of all the money that we provide for the fishing industry goes on these agreements , something like ECU 300 million annually . #% I should like to ask , when we talk about children who are abandoned in maternity hospitals and the issue of inter-country adoption , that we put the child at the centre of this issue , rather than any other concerns . #% I am also calling on the European Union and the airlines to improve access for disabled passengers , children and the elderly and to prohibit European Union airlines from charging an extra fee for assisting persons who are immobile onto any aeroplane within the European Union . #% Because not everyone gains equally . #% Therefore , I ask Council to take on board those issues in the Industry Council on 7 May . #% Now bring your energy home . #% ICBAN -- one of the longest established funding bodies has through its make-up become unbalanced . #% We must do this to protect the industry . #% We hope that Member States will not ignore or dismiss this House 's wish for action . #% I would like to thank Mrs Bonino . #% The Irish Government should make this change with or without Europe . #% Finally , I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7 , which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work , with the support of Eurostat . #% Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony . #% My reason for abstaining in the final vote on this report is two-fold . #% I did a report on it myself some years ago . #% Would not the world be a different place if , in our shaping of policy and legislation , in our negotiations and decision-making , we as politicians could keep these words in mind . #% The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations . #% There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame . #% Madam President , may I congratulate the Finnish presidency on this initiative in which I fully support him . #% I also owe a lot to this Parliament and to Strasbourg in terms of my own thinking . #% Mr Pex knows that and has admitted so to me . #% I want to ask you , Madam President , if you would ask somebody from the Commission or one of the Commissioners to come here to address Parliament and say what exactly we are doing to stop the terrible brutality taking place in Chechnya . #% Secondly , the price reductions should be significantly less than what is currently proposed and implemented more gradually . #% How the subject of the welfare of animals during transport can be seen as more relevant to economic and monetary policy than to agricultural policy or transport policy is beyond me . #% However , the Commission 's communication is rather a hodgepodge which lumps together willy-nilly the publishing industry which is knowledge-based and content-focused with primary forestry industries and also paper production . #% This would be an incorrect step because of the different criminal legal systems operating in Europe . #% I am not speaking here just of religion but also of politics . #% It never seems to be explained that there is a long-term objective which can bring profits . #% I was shocked to hear some of the comments that were made about her personally and I in no way subscribe to them . #% According to the text of this recommendation , environmental inspections will include : site visits ; verification of self-monitoring by the operators of the controlled installations ; checking the premises , the equipment and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site as well as the records kept by the operators . #% That should be the culture ; that must be the ethos we foster . #% We know that the main obstacle has been the predictable resistance of manufacturers . #% Citizens of each Member State must have access to the wide range of information concerning the factors affecting their health and on the way in which public health systems within that country meet their needs . #% Recently , a disproportionate number of those fatalities on Irish roads have , sadly , been Eastern European citizens who are working in Ireland . #% The Stability Pact for the EMU , brokered in Dublin , is not something to be joyful about , although furthering the battle against unemployment was a stated objective of the Irish presidency . #% You can only govern with the consent of the people and by 2010 domestic water charges could well be acceptable to the Irish electorate . #% Unfortunately it is another incident in the ongoing saga of accessing Strasbourg . #% Despite statements to the contrary , they can most certainly get two billion dollars ' worth of weapons into the conflict in Ethiopia and Eritrea . #% Recently I visited the Dublin Foundation , as a Member representing Dublin . #% On the outstanding areas of disagreement on the stability pact , what constitutes temporary and exceptional circumstances and the automaticity of fines for errant States , the ELDR supports the room for manoeuvre and judgment indicated by the Commission 's proposal . #% 
It can also be complementary to industry in those regions at a time when wild fish stocks are less available , so that the extra capacity we have and the infrastructure for processing and marketing can be made use of through the production of farmed fish . #% The Council of Ministers and the individual states are the people with the ultimate responsibility . #% I do not want my life regulated to that extent . #% Coming from a small country with a lesser spoken language , I should also like to recognize that , in this context , the small publishers of minority languages are indeed the true heroes of the publishing world . #% In the case of the structural funds - which are the one instrument of economic and social cohesion , and which represent a relatively modest amount of money bearing in mind that they transfer between 2 and 3 % of GNP to the Objective 1 regions - the fact that they have been underspent by 19 % is some cause for concern , because they are a rather precious instrument that should be utilized to the full . #% I feel that we are spancelled in terms of our legal powers unless we have Treaty legitimacy . #% The Nice Treaty makes no change to the emerging Irish and European security architecture but it is the crucial next step to heal the historic divisions of Europe caused by war and destruction . #% This initiative will ensure that the Institutions continue to work on the issues closest to their citizens ' hearts , while encouraging cross-border debate on European issues . #% I fear that if the regulations proposed in this directive were to be applied those consumers in poorer areas would end up with no credit unions and no option but to turn to loan sharks . #% We must ensure that the burden to take back WEEE rests with the manufactures , not the retailers . #% Thirdly , the European Commission 's proposal for corporate tax harmonisation is based on the assumption that harmful tax competition results in a shift in taxation away from taxes on mobile capital and towards taxes on comparatively immobile labour and that this development is harmful for employment and ordinary EU citizens . #% In relation to the remainder of his question , each presidency would probably look back at particular issues it was particularly successful in advancing . #% For that reason - regretfully , because I would have done anything to defeat Dr Rath 's purpose - I voted for the amendments which , unfortunately , were not passed . #% The UN estimates that all but one of its emergency appeals for humanitarian aid in 2007 were climate related . #% This is very serious and yet the Irish Government is not setting up an independent enquiry . #% I am concerned at some suggestions that export refunds should be ended and I reject any notion that export refunds are somewhat inherently conducive to fraud . #% I am confident that the Irish presidency will work hard to secure an agreement capable of winning the support of all the peoples of the European Union , in which all citizens and all Member States have equal rights , there is no second-class membership and we all make progress together . #% Mr President , the President-in-Office of the Council may find it strange that I should be welcoming the Irish Republic 's presidency today , but I know that he will understand my intention because he is going to be so busy over the next six months that we will not have to tolerate his presence at meetings in Northern Ireland . #% This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concerns . #% I thank him very sincerely for what I consider to be one of the finest statements I have heard in Parliament from a President-in-Office for a considerable period of time . #% There is a question of economic credibility at play here . #% The threatened withholding of the entire single farm payment is wholly disproportionate and potentially ruinous for many . #% Mr President , it is a time of unprecedented change in agriculture . #% I expected honesty and I expected the facts . #% Could he explain why it has taken so long to complete the building ? #% Commissioner , without seeking to be unkind , is it not fair to say that the Commission 's record on cutting red tape has been very high on promise , but very low on delivery ? #% When you allow this kind of omission and , at the same time , sit down at friendly trade negotiations with China , you are in danger of signalling EU approval . #% In Vietnam , persecution of Christians is rampant , being particularly dire in respect of minority Protestant Christian churches in Vietnam 's central highlands and the north . #% She is suspected of a crime in Germany but has not been convicted . #% I think it is fitting today that we are talking about this issue because it is the 50th birthday of Xanana Gusmão , the Timorese resistance leader who is serving a 20-year sentence for opposing the Indonesian rule . #% . Mr President , I wish to thank President Barroso and the entire Commission for being here this morning . #% We thought that was what ESDP was , until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy . #% While we should never risk rare blood groups or rare blood products being unavailable to patients through our unwillingness to pay , that must be the exception . #% This was the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years . #% The continuation of these peace initiatives is invaluable in rebuilding trust between communities and bringing communities together from both sides of the border . #% Bearing in mind that we in this House support the peace process , and that together with our international partners we have committed four and half billion dollars to underpin it , and also remembering the importance of bi-partisanship in the Irish peace process , I would ask you , Mr President , to urge the two main parties in Sri Lanka , together with the Tamil Tigers , to support the re-opening of negotiations to ensure that permanent peace is brought to that troubled country . #% Can I ask the President-in-Office to initiate a move himself with the Commission to ensure that a proper request is put before the presidency to be dealt with during your term of office ? #% Mr President , in this debate on terrorism I welcome the fact that last Saturday morning , in Belfast , an IRA member , Terry Davison , was charged in court with the murder of Robert McCartney and that a second IRA person , Jim McCormick , was charged with the attempted murder of Mr McCartney 's friend , Brendan Devine . #% Finally , I have one minor quibble with the rapporteur when she says that agriculture must remain central to the economies of rural areas . #% Commissioner , when Mr Mandelson trades off the last Irish cow , what do you expect we will get ? #% We have given far too little attention to the transport sector and to the potential of cogeneration . #% One issue raised is the need to ensure that the citizens of all 25 states who are resident in Member States other than their own are entitled to vote . #% Remembering that funding of any kind of abortion is unconstitutional and illegal in Ireland and that so-called safe abortion is included within this development aid programme , yet also remembering that Ireland has the lowest level of maternal mortality in the world - two in every 100 000 births - what is the response of the Commission to the majority of Irish citizens who are deeply concerned at this unconstitutional use of Irish tax-payers ' money ? #% There is nothing in the health and safety regulations that is an undue burden on business . #% Member States will be allowed on an exceptional basis to opt out of the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on established national practices . #% I hope that the presidency will ensure that the initiatives necessary to identify criminal assets are put in place and in good time to avail of the opportunity . #% Madam President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for their work on this issue . #% One has already been mentioned in the presidency document which has been given to Members : it is the fight against international crime and illicit drug-trafficking . #% This is a very technical subject and indeed to comprehend it one needs an understanding of almost all the details of the entire common agricultural policy . #% I believe that the overriding consideration is that the agency must operate in strict conformity with Community interests . #% We have moved a long way from that and , while Mr Casaca rightly points out the risks involved in policing export refunds , we are today spending only around four or five per cent - approximately EUR two billion - on export refunds , and we welcome that development . #% I would ask that this be communicated to the Bureau because something needs to be done about it . #% Only last week the Irish Government announced a dual strategy involving the spending of # Irl 430 million on improving rail safety standards , alongside the expansion of commuter train services in Ireland . #% On top of that , we must also put greater emphasis on a uniform inspection system across all European Union waters and give more powers to the Community inspectors to ensure that all regulations are being properly enforced . #% However , we should act quickly on this through the EU . #% If we look at what we are discussing here , the problems we have in the Union today , the rise of the Right or whatever it may be , the slowness of economic growth , the unemployment which we have in parts of the European Union , we find that these are not serious problems at all . #% It is there : what is missing is the will to search and to find it . #% Out of 15 amendments tabled in second reading , compromises were reached on 11 . #% In a recent policy paper the Irish Government committed itself to reducing landfill and increasing the use of more sustainable means of waste disposal . #% This would be inflationary , as would any commensurate increase in our already high annual circulation tax , resulting in car owners who had already paid VRT on existing vehicles being hit by a double whammy . #% We are now reaping the harvest of its inaction . #% I hope that despite this crisis , our national governments will be able to listen to suggestions from this House and work together in a constructive manner . #% It is important to get the message across to European citizens that we are all beneficiaries of the European model of farming . #% In Ireland , the Celtic Tiger economic boom has resulted in higher-paying , stable occupational opportunities for young professionals . #% I thank my colleague , Mr Rübig , for an excellent report . #% It is ironic that those same people voted against our amendment in committee in relation to the fact that fragrances are included in baby products . #% 
Madam President , Mr Varela 's report is on a very important and interesting subject -- that of the tuna industry . #% The Commissioner will be aware of the committee 's decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive , not least because of the complexity of the gambling market . #% It has a knock-on effect in other areas , especially where there are shared coastlines . #% Secondly , the Council is paying little or no attention to Parliament 's legitimate and legally enshrined role in the moves towards EMU . #% There is no need for it . #% We must lend our full support to these objectives . #% Mr President , urban development quite properly does not fall within the direct remit of the European Union , though in nation states it is substantially influenced by regional and other policies from Europe . #% That is why the European Union must respond in a coordinated and structured manner so as to guarantee that the best educational methods in the field of information technology are available to all our students . #% In my own country , Ireland , for example , EUR 160 m are to be spent on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector . #% The Governing Council does not appear to command the support of the Iraqi people . #% This would also give ordinary people throughout the European Union time to lobby for referenda on this issue . #% Some years ago I saw how parlous the state of the equipment was , particularly scientific equipment , in many of the countries that have been helped . #% It is still the only region in Ireland that retains Objective 1 status , though that , through national economic performance , ceases on 31 December 2006 . #% Even though it is late it is important that this Parliament should extend this support if the Union is to see itself as a genuine buttress of fundamental human rights and the freedoms which we espouse worldwide . #% Is that not the real meaning of the EU Commission 's document strategy paper on ` Global Europe : competing in the world ' , published only three years ago ? #% There is no suggestion to hand at yet , for example , that France or Britain is ready to hand over its independent nuclear deterrent to the WEU or to some new European defence organization . #% Let me also assure colleagues that there is a tougher side to the personality of the President , as I have seen in another House in another place . #% Then perhaps , in a different form but with the emphasis on the same strategy , the HELIOS could be applied under a new name in the mainline programme which is to be announced by the Commission in the very near future as outlined by the Commissioner . #% We had , unfortunately , a terribly long delay with regard to the agreement for the funding on the TENs . #% But this is also representative of a significant maturing in the European democratic process , with major institutional and constitutional implications . #% Mr President , with just six months to go before the introduction of the euro notes and coins , we must focus clearly on this event . #% After that , God only knows . #% My Question 39 is one simple sentence and all I require is one simple answer . #% The principle of subsidiarity in relation to water pricing policy is jealously guarded in Ireland , but public opinion will probably change by 2010 . #% We have a duty not just to pontificate about rights , but to actively encourage access to education , training , employment and opportunity . #% A priority must be the fight against poverty and social exclusion and in particular the discouragement of the 18 million unemployed . #% However , to my great surprise and disappointment , I believe Members will not be able to vote on that amendment . #% But let us be honest , the textile industry in Europe is one of the lowest paid too and the more educated our workforce becomes , the less inclined they are to take up the sewing machine . #% The President-in-Office has an onerous burden : to make progress in these areas under the shadow of what is , perhaps , the last remaining and most intractable political conflict in Europe is , indeed , a very heavy burden to bear . #% The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks . #% Those who talk about broader political integration within the Union take for granted that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a done deal . #% There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity . #% Only time will tell if they will be successful . #% All amendments concerning delegated acts from first reading should be reinstated . #% Ms Herczog 's report recognises the work done by the Commission and calls for further steps in this direction . #% I draw the Commissioner 's attention to the fact that many of the prisoners who are still suffering in prison without trial have been wounded and are ill , and no information has been made available to their relations . #% Mr Sharon does a grave disservice to the people of Israel . #% As far as possible serious crime must carry penalties which result in long jail terms . #% This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done , especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions . #% It is not often that I agree fully with my Northern Ireland colleague , Mr Paisley . #% At the Conference of Presidents it was also said , acknowledged and understood that in the normal course of events , apart from that political debate , the substance and conclusions of the work of the experts will revert to the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% There also has to be full implementation of existing legislation , as well as simpler and more efficient redress facilities for ordinary citizens . #% We must replace fluorinated gases with safer alternatives and take real action towards stopping their release into the environment . #% This resolution also calls for better convergence of financial reforms on both sides of the Atlantic , which I feel is very important to avoid any future crisis like the one that we are currently experiencing from happening again . #% It is time to tackle the underlying poverty situation in Haiti once and for all . #% In the protection of my constituents , my watchword is ` British standards for British citizens ' . #% This is a growing sector . #% In its own right , it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas . #% This would give tremendous EU added value to our work in trying to promote renewable energy . #% Capital moves easily across borders as multinational firms seek out the most attractive business locations . #% In a house that obsesses with green policy , some choose to needlessly pump 20 000 tonnes of carbon monoxide into the environment . #% It must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios . #% It is extremely unsatisfactory , in parliamentary terms , to find ourselves so late in the year and with so little time to consider this matter , to be bounced into a position which , in effect , represents a fait accompli . #% On 1 May 2004 we will be living in a Community of up to 25 Member States . #% But , given that the IRA has benefited to the tune of EUR 40 million from its Northern Bank robbery , it would be an odious scandal if state legal aid were available to anyone to defend such proceedings . #% I really do not see the difference , and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee , look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants . #% People know that the European project is necessary and important , but they are at a loss as to how they fit into the scheme of things . #% We now report in the follow-up , in our comment on the Commission 's response . #% I voted against the resolution for several reasons . #% From my own perspective , I am particularly interested in the promotion of sustainable tourism , for a number of reasons . #% I cite qualified majority voting as an example . #% I particularly welcome the possibility of a European constitution as a possible outcome . #% Finally , Florence will be remembered for the successful efforts of the Commission president and the Italian presidency in persuading the United Kingdom to lift its veto on the Union 's institutional democratic decisionmaking process . #% I hope that we will be able to welcome you back in the near future , when you will be able to see and perhaps help us on our way through some of those difficulties . #% in writing . - Paragraph 68 of this report contains a reference to a common consolidated corporate tax base , stating that there should be a common basis for company taxation . #% This is going to become a big problem and must be addressed . #% 
It was very important for us to have an opportunity to say whether nuclear weapons play a role of any kind in the future of the common , foreign and security policy . #% As co-legislator , we must be able to control , on an equal footing with the Council , the adoption and the execution of strategic decisions on the spending of development aid : how much , where and how . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate the rapporteur on this report and indeed congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her very excellent work in this area of social policy . #% Mrs Stauner is new to the Budget Control Committee , but her statement is a real reflection of the mood and the debate that went on . #% However , this problem must be examined at European level in line with the directive on dangerous substances in water and under the EU water framework directive launched in October 2000 . #% Biodiversity and sustainable development will not happen if they are planned out of the equation . #% Additionally , given the present geo-political climate , we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe . #% How exceptional would those circumstances have to be before you would continue to disburse budgetary support ? #% If we wish to be serious about how we develop people 's opportunities and give them the tools of freedom and independence , then giving and assisting in employment is one of the most important tools for combating poverty and exclusion . #% We would have blocked them if we could have done so . #% I appreciate that you actually understand the demands and needs of the ordinary people . #% There is a two-year waiting list and something like double the number of clinics are required in order to cope with the numbers involved . #% Although it has chosen not to join the European Economic Area , Switzerland has shown sustained interest in closer cooperation with the EU in the education , training and youth fields . #% The criteria mentioned in Article 290 are compulsory if they are fulfilled . #% We must maintain and increase food production within the European Union as part of our contribution to global food security . #% That is important too . #% However , Europe 's framework programme has a reputation for being the most bureaucratic in the world . #% It is an absolute disgrace the way that the RUC , the British army , the British Government and the Orange Order have decided that they are definitely going to make the six counties in the north-east of Ireland a Protestant State , an Orange State , for an Orange people , and forget about the human and civil rights of the nationalists and Catholics who are living there . #% The one sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those who are guilty of crimes against humanity that they will be brought to justice for their evil deeds . #% Despite the good words and the good intentions , I have three separate conclusions about what we saw last weekend , what we read in the papers from Britain , what we have seen in the news media over the last few days and what Mr Brown said in his speech last night . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer , although I did not learn much from that answer . #% There is a very disquieting level of public support indicated by opinion polls . #% Are farmers ' incomes such that they can afford to call out a vet when in doubt and have the European Commission and the national responses been adequate to the challenge ? #% Let us proceed to a vote and let us vote for a statute . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her usual very good report . #% But this directive has never been transposed into national law . #% I voted against amendments calling for yet more directives and proposals that would hold back industry . #% However , we are still playing catch-up . #% It is up to us , who support enlargement of the Union and who recognise the absolute right of candidate countries to join the Union , to convince our voting citizens of the importance of the provisions of the Treaty of Nice and of its broader political implications . #% It is important to stress that digitalisation must only be accepted when the rights of the stakeholders , including authors , publishers , illustrators , graphic designers and literary translators , are represented and protected . #% To the people of the United States of America , to its President , its Congressional and civic leaders , and its communities throughout the country , especially the peoples of New York and Washington , to the grieving families of the missing and the dead and to those who have survived the ordeal , we express our sympathy in this hour of hardship and devastation . #% It was reported last week that operations at the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant may cease sooner rather than later . #% There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and address myself to the Danesin report also on public-private partnership financing . #% EU companies will be able to buy up Chilean fish quotas on fully exploited fish stocks ; they will also have free access rights to Chile 's under-exploited fisheries resources . #% Since 1994 significant increased emissions have been documented from THORP , and this can not possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero . #% This bickering about procedures , individual issues or political issues does us no credit as a Parliament . #% While I welcome it , I urge the incoming French Presidency to give it the priority it needs . #% Somehow over the autumn and over Christmas and the New Year , by the time of the Council conclusions on 10 March , the seven had dropped to up to three additional substances . #% I can support the general content of the common position , with that one reservation . #% Furthermore , if the European Union is to become more responsible and flexible to the global current of market change , I propose to the Commission that a review clause be introduced into all new legislation . #% I believe that agriculture and a strong , well resourced common agricultural policy are central to this objective . #% At least 20 % of funding under the geographical programmes should go into these life-saving sectors of basic health and basic education . #% We must look at that particular aspect of legislation . #% I am satisfied that some sensitive issues of national concern will remain the preserve of individual Member States . #% Madam President , I too had not intended to take the floor , but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters of an hour . #% We welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process . #% I would cite , for example , the references to the treatment of prisoners and the protection of children . #% Now it is unable to do so , after being destroyed by the actions of Robert Mugabe and his henchmen . #% I reject this method of paying for BSE , a crisis which cereal farmers had nothing to do with and for which they should not be asked to pay . #% This gets round the difficulties that many speakers have referred to in relation to delays with petitions , although I acknowledge that the situation has considerably improved since the committee was recently reorganized . #% We also agree with the rapporteur 's amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for retabling these important amendments . #% GMOs are the new challenge facing us . #% I accept that a balance between fish resources and fleet numbers needs to be gained , but I do not accept that this should be at the expense of small fishing fleets , which account for over 80 % of the European fleet . #% However , there are times when particular airline rules , or , indeed , the attitude of a captain , can have a very negative impact on the travelling experience . #% Indeed , our amendments to the common position mean that a board can get fast-track approval in 14 days . #% The Committee of Inquiry made its point clearer than Parliament has ever been able to do , so the public was able to read in a very clear way where the failings were . #% I note that there are divergent opinions as to the danger they pose and would appreciate clarification to that effect as soon as possible . #% That is what the debate must be about . #% Yet who could have foreseen that in the second half of that century those same people would come together in the European Union . #% I do not share the view of some colleagues . #% Essentially , we need to strike a balance between the health and safety of workers and the temptation to over-legislate -- to be too prescriptive -- and to override the principle of subsidiarity and attempt a ` one size fits all ' piece of legislation . #% As regards extending working life I would like to say to both Commissioners that many workers are concerned that they will not end up with lifelong learning , but rather with lifelong working . #% Huge differences also exist between the theory , or the rhetoric , and practice on the ground in relation to women 's equality , the and situations . #% We also see that huge death duties accrue to partners who have bought houses together where , on the death of one partner , the other is faced with a massive tax bill , very often resulting in that person having to sell what was , in the truest sense of the word , a family home . #% Mr President , with demands for containment of spending this was never going to be a very happy procedure and yet I want to congratulate the rapporteurs , Brinkhorst and Fabra Vallés , and also the Irish presidency , for having achieved what might seem to be the impossible , of meeting our long-term commitments and resolving the immediate problems of today . #% 
In Ireland alone the ratio is about 74 % for those travelling within the Community and 26 % for those travelling outside . #% Our farmers are now the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control , and the Commission must give practical recognition to their economic plight . #% Your remarks were particularly welcome in view of the proposal to do away with the Committee on Women 's Rights . #% The research stated that residents within three kilometres of a landfill site were associated with a significantly higher risk of congenital anomalies and that systematic environmental health surveillance is needed for municipal landfill sites and other pollution sources . #% We know that . #% That policy prolonged the suffering of black people and it was only when the international community was mobilized into taking strong economic measures against South Africa that the apartheid regime crumbled . #% This motion follows previous resolutions and strongly worded paragraphs of the annual report on human rights produced by Parliament last year . #% It is time we realised that we have to maintain fish stocks . #% Unfortunately , however , like all of us here in Parliament , the rapporteur seems to be working at somewhat of a disadvantage , because we do not have access yet to the Council and the Commission 's evaluation mechanism concerning the operation of the European Arrest Warrant . #% Mr President , I want to offer my warmest welcome to Chancellor Schroeder who is here on behalf of the German presidency . #% The Irish compromise should at least take into account the transport of animals for slaughter with a maximum overall journey time . #% Then there are domestic and industrial appliances , insulation for the heating of homes , and in some parts of the EU for the cooling of homes . #% This includes the areas of TACs , managing effort through days at sea -- based on stocks size consistent with the precautionary principle -- and of course Chapter 4 , which most importantly deals with measures to police , monitor , inspect and survey the effort management system . #% We need to look more towards giving the skills and training to young people , middle-aged people , elderly people and those living in urban and rural areas to guarantee that they have equality of access to that training and new jobs . #% When a drought in any part of the world can actually cause total confusion in the whole market for everyone else , this is not a situation that we can allow to continue . #% What will be the long-term consequences of that ? #% Developing countries claim correctly they did not cause this crisis . #% It must be said at the start that both the Republic of Congo and Cameroon have highly repressive governments . #% You can not say to the French , the Belgians and the Irish ` no , you must restrict your effort ' , while at the same time effectively say to the Spaniards ` you can increase your effort four-fold . #% Not trying out failed systems of the past , not trying out failed mechanisms of the past , but dealing with the reality of what we are presented with . #% As we have seen with the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease , Newcastle disease and other animal diseases , a policy aimed at slaughtering animals is the only sure way of killing off the disease . #% I agree with the rapporteur 's comments when he introduced his report that voluntary codes of conduct and binding agreements are not necessarily mutually exclusive . #% My staff have been bullied to the extent that one of them had to take days off with a stress-related illness . #% The Commission has proposed a number of progressive changes in the current technical measures including square mesh panel , increase in mesh size , grates or grids to filter out the shrimp catches and others . #% The financial services action plan must be implemented so that there will be an integrated financial services market in the Union by 2005 . #% They refused to go and were loyal to the king . #% However , I hope that he would agree with me that these atrocities in Darfur , where 180 000 people have been killed in two years and more than two million have been driven from their homes , need more urgent attention . #% Do you not think we could learn from the United States ' comprehensive approach to these problems ? #% Some of them are working straight shifts of 36 and 37 hours without any rest period or sleep . #% We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49 , while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest , as long as the rules are necessary , proportionate and non-discriminatory , i.e. not discriminating against other EU operators . #% Mr President , on a point of information for Members who may not be aware of this : Commissioner Bangemann was wrong in what he has proposed , especially when he held up the examples of the Scandinavian countries in the deregulation of postal services . #% These failures should not be sidestepped in arguments about proportionality or protectionism . #% The EU certainly now has a golden opportunity to put in place new policies in the fields of consumer rights , food safety and assistance to the elderly , as well as areas of environmental protection . #% I want to thank Mr Poignant for his cooperation while producing my report . #% This makes it possible to use waste materials , which would normally be thrown away , in order to produce energy . #% So much for the Lisbon mission . #% Nine hours is about right . #% This is something that should be highlighted , particularly at election time . #% Mr President , the Commission 's proposal for a recommendation on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields was formulated against the background of increasing public concern over possible links between electromagnetic fields and health problems . #% However , whilst he may be technically correct in saying that the Council does not have an area or role of responsibility with regard to the question of nuclear facilities , there is an immediate need for political leadership . #% If the Commission is not going to make a statement about this week , why not ? #% Not all the transitional issues are just for the applicants , particularly in agriculture , regional policy and cohesion policy . #% I would ask you to convey my objections at least , if not the objections of many others in this Parliament , to this operation by the United States . #% From the way in which this interview was received and commented upon that has clearly happened here . #% This person paid quite a lot of money for the ticket ; it was not one of those tickets costing a couple of euro , it was quite expensive . #% The Chinese Government insists that it should be permitted to carry on with peaceful nuclear explosions or PNEs . #% Mr President , Ireland has the European Parliament to thank for ensuring extra funding for neighbourhoods in crisis . #% I wonder why ? #% I deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields . #% I would also like to confirm that our group would be reluctant to support the amendment proposed by the PPE Group for the reasons just mentioned by other speakers . #% The exclusion of inshore fishing from current Community legislation is creating an environment in which mere survival is questionable . #% I am supportive of the principle of Turkish accession , but recognise that it will be a long , hard road . #% It was not exactly as Mr Casaca said , but it withdrew after the 200-mile limit was extended . #% Darfur should be a priority debate in Parliament this week and we believe it would be a missed opportunity to delay that debate and resolution until next month . #% The true test of a democracy is the will to redress any potential wrongs and ensure that real justice is served . #% Labour Euro MPs do not believe that families should continue to bear the full cost of the UK 's budgetary contribution . #% Could you give us an indication tonight as to what you feel would be the best way forward to ensure the continuance of the school milk programme and how it might be altered at some stage in the future ? #% However , this is where we differ from some of the speakers and from the proposal in Mr Mann 's report , in particular Paragraphs 11 and 13 , which deal with taxation . #% I am sure many colleagues from other countries have experienced the same problem that very often young people in prison , who may not in fact be addicted when they go in , come out addicted . #% It merely serves the interests of the more powerful , and that is not a Europe that we want to see emerge in the future . #% It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of Ireland 's entire fishing industry and the survival of all Ireland 's coastal communities may depend on your support . #% It is important for us as a Parliament to recognize our role in bringing to fruition the ideas of what the people of Europe want to see . #% in writing . - This proposal aims at ensuring an exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic , environmental and social conditions . #% I would have preferred to hear the Commissioner plan for what consumption will be for the next three or four years and take immediate measures to reduce production . #% I know there is a different set of criteria for abduction by parents , but surely we should not make so great a distinction between criminally and parentally-abducted children ? #% Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions . #% 
Mr President , obviously my name is not Al Gore and this is not Florida . #% In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure . #% We would not accept that from this Parliament or from any national parliament ; the Council should not be allowed to get away with it . #% Mr President , I refer to an administrative change that has been made in Parliament , which comes to me as news . #% I support the terms of the today 's report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey 's EU membership . #% Mr President , EU leaders met in Ghent on 21 September to evaluate how the Union should react to the horrific terrorist attacks in America . #% One crucial one is how we connect our investment and research and development and innovation to the production system itself . #% We are therefore in a stronger position to shape that world , particularly in this very historic week -- who could have dreamt that the whole of Europe would be together ? #% Other pieces of legislation are required to complete the coverage needed in this area and I would urge the Commission and the Council not to delay further in agreeing what is necessary . #% I hope all Members will support this report tomorrow , along with the two amendments in it , as we need a majority vote . #% In this House we have prioritised consumer protection , established the family farm as the agricultural model and the basic unit of production , and made rural development and the preservation of rural communities the second pillar of CAP reform . #% They also have an obligation to the McCartney family , who have a right to expect justice for the murder of Robert . #% I believe that we have a duty to contribute to the upholding of peace but I think it legitimate to do so in a manner true to our own traditions . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Collins and Mrs Jöns for their excellent work here in relation to the structural funds for Ireland . #% South Africa is the major economic force in sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union is its principal trading partner . #% Robert Mugabe has been strutting the world stage for far too long now and has been behaving in a most dictatorial and brutal fashion towards his own people , and particularly towards opponents within his country . #% Parliament should support what the Environment Committee is putting forward . #% On the Irish radio programme ` Live Line ' he disingenuously claimed , that as these votes closed at 5.14 pm , I could have easily caught the Frankfurt to Dublin flight . #% Why is Sinn Féin / IRA not helping it on the ground to get justice within its own community ? #% There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers . #% I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States . #% The Commission and Mr Cunha have both done very good jobs in analysing the results of the final year of the third multiannual guidance programme . #% I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Schlyter , for his excellent cooperative work on this report . #% The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard . #% I find that unacceptable in terms of the democratic accountability of this House . #% Civil protection structures have to prioritise preparedness for floods and droughts . #% I have no doubt that some of the very large industries will be able to cope with this and take it in their stride , but the small entrepreneurs trying to develop small industries and get them off the ground are probably going to be hit very hard . #% Within hours of his resignation , the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions . #% The problem has been identified and is being solved and the good news is that the system is now working . #% According to a Belgian study presented last year to the European Respiratory Society Congress , it is estimated that one in seven city dwellers will show signs of lung damage caused by asbestos . #% Finally , the guidance and leadership that the Commissioner has given on this issue , and the clear thinking and cool logic which has been shown , is a model that other Commissioners would do well to follow when dealing with other public service issues . #% Mr President , there has been severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice , not just here in this House , but throughout Europe . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the presidency 's position on tackling the smuggling of Ecstasy , since it can be made in someone 's kitchen and does not need to be transported across borders ; whereas heroin , opium and cocaine involve importation . #% This is the biggest test so far of the 21st century . #% However , in phasing out substances , we must also ensure that existing F-gases are not simply released into the environment . #% Our response to the SARS pandemic shows what we can do if we make communicable diseases a priority . #% I am thinking particularly of my own country , Ireland . #% It is time for the European institutions to be equally vociferous in bringing the arguments in favour of a single currency to Europe 's electorate . #% I for one am opposed to a criminal justice system established on the continental model , with its inherent assault upon the essential building blocks of our distinctive and historic British common law system , which include not least trial by jury , habeas corpus , and the separation of the judiciary from the investigative process . #% However , European Union measures adopted in this sphere shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent protective measures on this subject . #% The company criticised in the amendments ( Raytheon ) was in fact welcomed by two Nobel Peace Prize winners ( Hume/Trimble ) . #% Please tackle that . #% The locked-box or locked-store system must apply to the manufacturer and on the farm where the feed is to be stored and used . #% Top priority continues to be the need to protect and to care for the refugees . #% To focus too closely on the negligible quantitative effect of Kyoto , in terms of immediate results of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions , however , is to miss the point . #% I welcome the compromise agreement on the Europol convention which , together with the extradition convention , I hope will be implemented as quickly as possible by all Member States . #% Perhaps we are too ambitious or too wide-ranging with regard to the areas that we want to see included . #% It is important for these systems to be in place to prevent the regulatory crisis of 2008 from occurring again . #% It is also in breach of the directives that oblige the company to inform the workers of its intentions . #% We need political will -- which does not exist and is unlikely to exist -- within the European Union to avoid a repeat of the disaster . #% Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe , we need to be realistic . #% Furthermore , this WHO body takes the added precaution of incorporating large safety factors into the limit values to public exposure . #% The end result should put beyond doubt the quality and safety of all food products , and provide the assurances consumers have been seeking and to which they are entitled . #% The EU has human rights and international law at the centre of its value system and it is our responsibility to call for the truth behind this tragedy . #% The next 20 years will probably see an increase of around 80 % in the quantities of PVC waste because of the increase in the average lifespan of certain PVC products such as window frames . #% This directive goes a long way towards ensuring that this does not happen . #% I can tell him to take off the earphones now , I am going to proceed in English . #% Maybe an onus on banks to put up notices in all their branches displaying these rules and regulations could be one way . #% If the Commission is setting a precedent and , more to the point , if the Council sets a precedent this week , should we not be told , at the earliest date and when the House is as full as possible , of the precedent and the response of the House . #% The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union 's proposal . #% The gender pay gap remains unacceptably high across Europe at 16 % . #% Practically every night television news bulletins bring stories into our homes of more and more horrendous crimes being perpetrated by evil people , often against defenceless people in our society , such as young children or the very old . #% The financial services sector has become very sophisticated at risk management and so the regulatory framework has to respond to the times . #% Frankly , in relation to the specific topic I believe the Commissioner has at least indicated in principle the direction of his response . #% I congratulate Mr Nisticò on his excellent work and I commend Amendment No 75 which gets the balance right . #% However , these bodies can not function without a clear Community-level policy and the necessary designated financial resources to underpin them . #% 
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have met and this can be seen as a first step on the long road to peace and reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples . #% Commissioner , I would say that the IAEA are not competent to make judgements and pronouncements on health and I ask you to state that the World Health Organization is ... #% But the people in those camps would prefer to be re-settled back in their homelands and not have that money . #% In the two concrete cases that I am aware of , Mallow and Carlow sugar plants in Ireland , this balance is not apparent . #% Madam President , on Tuesday night in this House I made my position clear in a speech on BSE . #% The 1926 census in Ireland found that more than half of the entire population of the country was engaged in agriculture and yet the country did not produce surpluses and there were people short of food . #% There are other groups involved in paramilitary activities , beatings and shootings . #% Eurozone leaders tell us that there is no Greek debt restructuring , but since when is a delay of a repayment date not a restructuring ? #% If not , then what are the proposals from the Council - especially the incoming Irish presidency if it has any - with regard to implementing a new article to ensure that these social action programmes can be undertaken ? #% On what authority ? #% This new interinstitutional approach within the European Union was certainly in evidence at the Tampere Summit . #% They are indeed the right way to sustainability , but we are not pursuing them strongly enough . #% At least ECU 225m are currently being spend in the EU on nuclear research . #% It also deals with the issue of child soldiers . #% Maritime safety is also becoming a more important political issue within the European Union . #% I would also join with Ms McKenna in saying that vitamins - which I personally , as a nurse , do not regard as a food supplement - are on free sale in our country and that I have never yet heard of anybody overdosing on vitamin C or any other vitamin . #% I might point out that in the presentation of the European Union priorities of the Irish presidency , which was made by the Tánaiste in the House this morning , one of the priorities which we set out under our drugs and organized crime proposals is an exchange and training of law enforcement officers . #% We should have the courage to use our experience and our position in the world to promote peace and stability in the global arena and to treat the problems of displacement and terrorism at source , for example by helping to ensure an economic future for the millions of young people living in the Middle East . #% We need to look at both these sectors , at how we are actually supporting them . #% Transparency is , I believe , the key to European democracy and its main building block . #% The European Union ' s response to the Balkans , on our very doorstep , was generally viewed as too little , too late . #% Let me be clear : we need better controls there as well . #% Mr President , we seem to lose sight of the development aspect of the Doha Development Round as it grinds on . #% Today we are at Community average . #% Let us put our hands on our hearts and commit ourselves to peace , to justice , but , most importantly of all , to humanity . #% A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or demerits of staging posts in general , and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that staging posts remain . #% in writing . - I support this report which urges the Commission to remain vigilant and undertake a review of the scientific basis and adequacy of EMF limits through the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks ( SCENIHR ) . #% The proposed directive focuses only on Member States who are active participants in the production of nuclear energy . #% It is important that we clarify for the public the distinct functions of the two institutions and press for more publicity and a more effective information policy for both the Ombudsman 's office and Parliament 's petition process . #% Is there proper fostering in place and are there pending cases still unresolved ? #% Therefore I have to ask myself : is the chicken meat produced to our existing standards , never mind the proposed increased standards ? #% I know from experience in my area that many sheep farmers and suckler cow farmers are simply leaving the industry . #% Vessels differ in their environmental and social impact and preference should be given to funding the withdrawal of damaging units and the creation of less destructive units . #% I would like to congratulate the decision of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association to accept a timetable to cut CO2 emissions in new cars by 25 % by the year 2000 . #% There is one big lesson to be learned from this fund operating together with the Delors package : this is that small amounts of money can very often have a bigger political impact than the investment would suggest . #% People recognize it as a human issue and , while we are not going about it strictly speaking as lawyers , through Parliament we have considerable influence in putting pressure on local authorities who might be ignoring these cases assuming them just to be domestic tiffs . #% I also welcome our amendment , which adds nanosciences to nanotechnology . #% As I found out when I was rapporteur on the report for the same subject for 1994 , the level of surveillance and control of EU vessels varies widely from one country to another , but nowhere at all is it satisfactory . #% It is important , for example , that European leaders reaffirm their commitment to the central role of the family farmer in agricultural and in rural development policy . #% While social protection , social security and social advantages are important areas , they can not be considered ` services ' and are best dealt with elsewhere . #% I broadly support her position , although I am not sure that I would like to replace the term ` market failure ' with ` market inefficiency ' . #% Here , the Commission conveniently forgets that before the economic boom the citizens of our country were required to make major sacrifices in order to achieve that boom . #% I voted against this report as the EU should be seeking ways to improve our competitiveness in line with the Europe 2020 strategy instead of introducing legislation which threatens our competitiveness . #% Whatever savings can be made from agriculture will be necessary to prevent the environmental , and indeed the economic , deterioration of rural Europe as it is . #% The US State Department has consistently reported that Colombia 's armed forces have taken measures to punish human rights abuses in their ranks . #% Is it really ideal , if we are setting precedents , that the European Parliament should contemplate a debate at 5.30 p.m. on a Thursday , which if it is anything like the 5.30 p.m. debate I attended on the Thursday of the January part-session , is not to be recommended as a time for setting precedents . #% As always , the rapporteur , Ms Auroi , has produced a good report for our Committee , and many of her proposed amendments are welcome improvements to the Commission text . #% The prevention of waste is one of the ways of tackling it , because the disposal of waste -- whether through landfill or incineration -- causes health and environmental problems . #% It is vital that these regions continue to retain objective 1 status if they are to achieve the same level of growth as other regions within the European Union . #% These resignations must cause the world community to reconsider the justification for the continuing sanctions policy and also the bombings . #% The key concern in relation to the amendments to this directive is the deadline for achieving compliance with the proposed higher recovery and recycling targets . #% I am very disappointed that Ireland voted for this agreement , thus giving the green light to unwarranted intrusions into the privacy of Irish passengers . #% Mr President , as a representative from Ireland , I wish to express my deep opposition to the Commission 's proposals which we know are aimed at reducing the size of the European fishing fleet by 40 % over the next six years . #% I thank the European Parliament and the Commission for their support in this regard . #% The legal framework is clear : Article 52 of the European Patent Convention states that software as such can not be patented . #% This is primarily the case because of the disastrous environmental damage that was caused as a result of the Erika tanker sinking of the coast of France a couple of years ago . #% The problems start when the animal leaves the farm , goes to a haulier and moves onward . #% Madagascar makes a profit out of this that it would not otherwise receive , so its economy does benefit to some extent . #% Technical conservation measures will play an important role in the conservation of stocks by protecting juvenile fish and will reduce the threat to further yields . #% Think again , Mr President , when these matters come up for debate and discussion . #% It is not about the very short-term fortunes of any national political party for electoral purposes . #% The one thing we can be sure of is not whether there is another outbreak of an exotic disease in the EU , but when . #% The key priorities are : to be effective , to have a fair and equitable distribution , to have affordable policy , because less sometimes can be more , and to have a sustainable cohesion policy that will take us into the new millennium . #% I would encourage the minister to continue working towards a reassuring timetable in Göteborg . #% Madam President , I do think it is probably incumbent upon this House to produce up-to-date reports but I would also insist that the statistics are checked not only by national or regional indicators , but with Eurostat , to make sure that we have the latest , up-to-date figures and not figures which some Members may wish to insert to make their case look worse in terms of their structural funds . #% I am in favour of cutting costs in relation to the Commission and its agencies . #% 
There must be tough and dissuasive penalties to deter the cat and dog fur traders . #% The strategy of the government is completely unacceptable . #% That proved to be disastrous , because it encouraged a belief that you could keep a foot in both camps . #% Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month . #% The same is true of the single currency . #% Most importantly of all , however , because we value Russia as a partner for future developments , we should call on Russia to take the proper steps to ensure that the rights of all European Union Member States are respected equally - whether large or small , whether a neighbouring country or not , whether a former dominion or not . #% Unfortunately , surveys show that at this stage more than half of European citizens are opposed to the release and marketing of genetically modified foods . #% I would like to highlight the fact that I voted against Paragraph 4 ( d ) which calls for `` The removal of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure '' . #% All of these areas and , of course , the work you have undertaken with the European Parliament on enhancing transparency , should be recognised as matters of importance and substance . #% Those close to our farming sector will be aware of the growing concern about the future viability of our traditional family farm structure . #% This annual procedure should be looking at the state of the agriculture industry , its long-term viability , recognizing that our share in world production is becoming ever reduced . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her answer . #% We have all seen surveys that show that air traffic is going to increase in the coming years . #% I respect the rights of other Member States , but they must respect our right and listen to our concerns and act on them . #% In the context of this recovery , I would like to stress the main points of the report . #% We have half a diabetic nurse post to cater for 250 people , when there should be one for 50 people in order to be effective . #% Mr President and Commissioner , in introducing this report on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms , I can be confident that the proposals are based on sound scientific advice . #% As we know , binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration , paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector , who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement . #% The rapporteur has rightly pointed out that it is possible to save large quantities of oil using existing technology . #% It is amazing that in the European Union we only have two or three companies or people providing insurance for aircraft . #% Yet what we have in this work programme for next year is the promise of a green paper to discuss the principles on which services of general economic interest might - might - be constructed . #% I still judge that the draft directive does not provide adequate protection for farmers either here in Europe or in developing countries . #% I have to say that I , and I think my colleagues in this House , sense a threat in some areas . #% If it were not for the vigilance of politicians , NGOs , environmentalists and consumer interests , this technology would by now have been foisted on society . #% Each manufacturer of new products should cover its own costs , and the collection and treatment of all new products can be done collectively . #% Until we can clarify this confusion , could you please ban the transport of this material over the territories of the Member States and require organizations , such as British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. , to refrain from issuing misleading assertions that it has been officially designated as a low-dispersal material , because this is not helpful and , indeed , extremely misleading in this context ? #% Last year I was rapporteur for the report on the CFP monitoring system . #% We live in an internal market where there is free movement of people . #% Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents , in terms of the chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons , radioactive materials and other harmful substances which , because they go largely unnoticed , are a cause of major concern . #% I want to make quite clear my absolute rejection of attempts by the President of Parliament and the Conference of Presidents to set aside this motion on the human rights situation in Western Sahara until after the visit and conclusion of some future EU delegation . #% Equally , however , allowing for different threshold values in Member States to take account of these local natural conditions must not lead to unacceptable differences in the protection level or distortions in competition and trade . #% The Irish people only recently displayed their commitment to the EU by voting strongly for the Lisbon Treaty . #% Just to refer to the Commissioner 's response to Mr Aylward 's original question with regard to the transferability of sugar quotas . #% We must ensure that consumers ' rights are protected as these technologies continue . #% Patient health and safety must be paramount , but it must not be an excuse to block the free movement of professionals . #% The new constitution is nothing to be proud of for anyone who believes in democratic control and its essential companion , national sovereignty . #% Because of the dangers which are present because of lack of proper controls and rest periods for people involved in the transport sector , it is essential that we have common regulation across the European Union . #% Regardless of his much-documented lifestyle off the field , on the soccer field he had a world stature . #% The kind of late-night dealing and smoke-filled rooms that finalised the treaty was the unacceptable face of the EU and it is not worthy of a Union of 350 million people . #% They can institute a policy of prompt payment without the need for EU legislation . #% in writing . - I welcome the European Court of Auditors ' 2006 Annual Report as it identifies welcome improvements , particularly in relation to agricultural spending . #% I am confident that the Irish and European consumer organisations will support this proposal and that EMU will become a reality in the near future despite the apprehensions of certain members of the Union . #% Globally , aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing food sectors . #% While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States , I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs , which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union . #% Rather than investing billions of euro in new nuclear plants , we need to invest that money in developing renewable energy sources . #% Parliament has to be involved in this better regulation agenda and must have the right as co-legislator to ensure that the expert laws voted through this House can be scrutinised and monitored . #% The budget for the European Commission to highlight the dangers of cigarette smoking is only EUR 6 million and this pales into insignificance when one looks at the staggering levels of money available to the tobacco lobby to put in place innovative pro-tobacco marketing and advertising campaigns . #% The temporary committee and the report focus mainly on the threat to European industrial competition and the threat posed by industrial espionage . #% Next week 's European summit must concentrate on defusing the tensions which have been allowed to build up in recent weeks between the British Government and its European partners . #% I hope the Commission will be able to take on board the very positive aspect that I have put forward in my amendment . #% Were there crimes ? #% The Kyoto Protocol is off life support because the Russian Federation ratified it . #% The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable . #% It is clear that the WTO can not succeed as long as we insist on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihoods of small European and Irish farmers . #% Be that as it may , I do not deny Members and colleagues the opportunity to table this motion of censure . #% We need to engage in education in the real sense , to open minds to the fact that the world is extremely diverse and could be a very tolerant and good place to live if we could only live with each other . #% This is what the Commission proposes and I fully endorse it . #% Not all aspects of energy are included in this framework . #% I hope the voting lists can be changed along those lines . #% Ironically , Mr Sterckx 's report points out that six months later , neither France nor Spain had designated safe havens and contingency plans to the Commission , as required by EU law . #% Is this latest concept the ideal instant quick-fix to help us overcome our difficulties or is it a Trojan Horse designed to undermine the drive towards an ultimate federal Union ? #% I omitted to sign last night as I was travelling all day and arrived a bit late last evening . #% I think that this is something we have got to give very serious thought to . #% There are far more aspects to energy than just environmental aspects . #% . I voted today against the EC-Morocco Partnership Agreement on fisheries because I am not satisfied that all steps were taken in respect of this agreement , which could and should have been taken to protect the sovereignty and rights of Western Sahara . #% I want also to recognize that in spite of the need to contain spending we have met our commitments in the area of regional policy and we have gone on to increase commitments for the structural funds by 8.05 % . #% 
The ELDR believes that the Santer-led caretaker Commission has lost its political and moral authority to act and so it must go immediately and be replaced by an interim Commission for the balance of its unexpired term . #% All these are things Mr Parish has underlined . #% We are pleased to support all Mr Evans ' amendments and we wish him and all those who benefited from the Tempus programme a very happy Christmas . #% This is positive and should , in my view , be fully supported . #% Ten years ago , who would have believed there would be such an expansion in information technology services . #% The figures are startling : 18 million people across the EU suffer from severe depression ; 58 000 of our citizens commit suicide every year -- roughly equivalent to two or three small towns in any rural area being obliterated every year . #% Where was ECHO ? #% Many of them from all communities have not received justice . #% Of course , people can be up against big companies with huge amounts of power and resources at their disposal which makes it very very difficult in many cases for them to pursue these cases to the end and ensure that the companies pay the price . #% I have serious problems with all of this , and think we are taking the wrong approach . #% It is interesting to see the geographic interest and to recognize the diversity that enlargement has brought to thinking on afforestation in the Union . #% Capitulating to China was both immoral and cowardly . #% This applies not only to women but also to men . #% It would be wrong , however , to deprive agriculture of the benefits of modern research . #% However , the stark fact is that over 90 % of municipal waste is disposed of in landfill sites in my country , and four million tonnes of waste is produced each year in the continent of Europe . #% Recommending that the legal basis be changed to 100a ensures that the codecision procedure will be followed in full . #% in writing . - Small and medium-size enterprises will play a vital role in reinvigorating economies across Europe that are currently witnessing economic contraction or , at best , slight economic growth . #% All proposed amendments were already included in Parliament 's first reading position , which was adopted by plenary with a large majority on 21 October 2010 . #% Could you please detail any amendments you are proposing in the directive before the second period of NAPs ? #% These delays are taking place on many flights because of the difficulties with air traffic systems in Europe . #% Guantánamo has become , in publicity terms , an open sore for many people in relation to all that is negative about the so-called war on terrorism . #% As legislators , we have overregulated their lives and reduced their natural inclination to become entrepreneurs . #% I am very glad that we finally put this directive to bed in the last session . #% As the Commission 's Green Paper on demography states , there is no economic growth without population growth . #% Additionally , opponents of the Treaty have been strengthened by their electoral success in the recent Irish general election . #% Of course , any installation opting out must be required to take equivalent action to reduce emissions . #% The desire from an environmental perspective for a wholly mandatory regime must fit well with market considerations and be industry-friendly . #% In the Pacific , also , nets are 40-50 km in length and that is an entirely different situation from what we have in the Atlantic . #% We got the worst of all worlds , in that the Union owned the fish , but the national governments had the job of policing them . #% The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States . #% We need specialized , centralized courts in all our countries who will be well briefed and will deal with these cases within 24 hours of them being brought to their notice . #% The statement on the Pakistan election showed little commitment to this . #% A second point on the timing : this Committee of Experts will make its report available - if I recall correctly - on 15 March . #% May I say , first of all , that there is no proposal before the Council from the Commission . #% However , it is a source of regret that latterly this process has slowed down and it is indeed a worrying development . #% In due course , within the House and in the appropriate fora , my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves , as Parliament , must learn from the hearings process . #% Much of the criticism of the handling of the BSE crisis made within both committees of inquiry centred on the failure of Commission staff involved . #% The genocide that is taking place in Chechnya seems to be ignored by the Western powers and certainly by the European Parliament . #% Recently the British Government White Paper : Competitiveness - Helping Business to Win said that small firms pay a vital role in the economy . #% The total number of companies willing and able to produce influenza vaccines has plummeted in recent years from more than two dozen in 1980 to just a handful in 2004 . #% Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanctuaries left in Europe . #% There is no need to have any other system . #% I would like to remind the Council that the mission I led was not a Parliament mission , it was an EU mission consisting of 88 dedicated people , who discharged their task professionally in line with internationally accepted criteria for election observation . #% There has been no assessment of the social impact it will have , and no serious consultation with post office management , with employees or with consumers . #% Perhaps we could ring the bells . #% Attractive Employment and Working Conditions and #% For more than 20 years European policy in respect of waste management has been based on the principle of treating hazardous industrial waste and household and similar waste in a different way . #% We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya . #% In conclusion , I appeal to the Minister , in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council to take his courage in his hands and to actively seek the support of all the other Member States in including children specifically , clearly and as a top priority in the Treaty . #% I know the Commissioner will tell us the tale about interinstitutional agreements , the Council , the Commission , precedence and practice . #% If Sinn Féin had participated in the debate this morning they would -- although they are the direct political opposites in Northern Ireland -- have been making exactly the same case . #% We can not support the identification and traceability amendments because this is a matter for DG V , not because we do not support the principle but because it is for another DG , and for that reason solely . #% The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna . #% At the insistence of this Parliament , free repairs or replacements will also include postage , labour and materials . #% Mr President , I had hoped that the extra time taken by the Commission to fine-tune the proposals would have resulted in documents which would fully reflect the concerns raised by this House when we adopted our opinion earlier this year . #% Mr President , what recourse have we in this Parliament to such cowardly responses to serious questions ? #% We must confront genocide and do everything we can to facilitate peace in the region . #% Despite the fact that there has been a change of government , there seems to be no change in policy . #% In its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision - and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field . #% I hope that the problem can be resolved as a matter of urgency . #% More and more flights and lower air fares have improved Ireland 's attractiveness as a holiday destination and Irish tourism is performing very well . #% That is the reality of this . #% Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , the strategic importance of Afghanistan can not be overestimated . #% I would like to stress that neither the fishing industry associations nor indeed any individual fishermen have approached me seeking to be included in the directive . #% Mrs Plooij warns us very starkly that our competitiveness is falling . #% The biology of a baby is quite different from the biology of a teenager . #% 
We should now be generous enough to take our share of those fleeing persecution and those seeking to make a better life for themselves . #% Preparing for enlargement is not going to be a particularly easy task and it will not be made any easier if Parliament and the Commission are not working closely together to guarantee that tough decisions must be taken on these issues or worked through in an atmosphere of understanding and equal purpose . #% However , the Government of Sudan remains opposed to such a force , accusing the UN of an exercise in neo-colonialism manipulated by Washington . #% It can work , if it gets time . #% The leading candidates are provisionally closing chapters at an impressive rate and the leading candidate country , Cyprus , now has 23 chapters concluded . #% I have nothing against the Scottish Police . #% Twenty-two thousand children die each day , every day , a short plane journey from this building . #% It is lax in the extreme that the hospital which is located near the biggest concentration of chemicals factories in Ireland has no decontamination unit for treating chemicals workers or members of the public who fall victim to major accidents . #% However , the preventive measures that have been put in place such as the ban on meat-and-bone meal should , on scientific evidence , see the elimination of BSE and its threat to human health . #% The common fisheries policy goes too far . #% I believe that aquaculture can provide part of the solution to restoring the balance between imports and fish produced within the EU . #% He has looked at creating solutions to the problems that we now face . #% The most immediate objective for the 15 existing Members of the European Union is to ensure that the Treaty of Nice is ratified across the Union as soon as possible . #% Pig prices and sheep prices have collapsed . #% I wish to put on the record my support for the Treaty of Nice . #% I believe we must do more to assist those interested in a restructuring programme - and the rapporteur made reference to it in his report - through the pooling of land and human resources , which would lead to greater efficiency and improved competitiveness . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I too recognise the importance of Pakistan to all of us in the fight against terrorism and it has been an ally to all of us in that fight . #% It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward . #% This is ridiculous : a war is being waged against voiceless children basically because the United States , and indeed the British , are supporting this kind of inhumanity to their fellow man . #% It should not be an indirect subsidy paid because , in cases of over-production of milk , fines are paid by the Member State rather than by the individuals who over-produced ; this amounts to indirect subsidisation . #% But trading permits seem to work . #% The only problem is that the rapporteur may have done too good a job . #% In my own country , for example , the lower tax rate has meant a multiplication of the tax take . #% I am pleased that the German presidency has also made a priority of support for Northern Ireland . #% We must also prevent the construction of projects or the manufacture of products that have devastating consequences for the environment in these places . #% Why are we being denied safer standards when they exist , given that , for example , American standards provide better protection ? #% Is it not outrageous that a regime led by what can only be described as a tyrant , along with his cronies , can carry on with the ruination of a country and its people with total impunity ? #% At the same time we are not denying access of citizens to the brave new world of the information society and , in particular , to the more disadvantaged users and communities . #% Any exceptions to this are condemned outright by European farmers . #% We were disappointed therefore when the Caudron report , voted recently , provided public funding for research in conflict with these guidelines against the constitutional position of my country and three other Member States . #% The programme would also attempt to promote consumer rights to information , to education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests . #% Progress will only be made if it is agreed that it is a truly international city to which all traditions have a valid claim . #% What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister . #% Therefore , the EU must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and , if not , then action must be taken . #% The main thrust of this resolution is to call on the UN to set a clear date for deployment of the planned UN-supported peacekeeping force , or hybrid force , into Darfur , even in the absence of agreement with the Sudanese Government , in order to secure humanitarian aid corridors to an increasingly isolated population in the region . #% Current budget lines already in place for this project are easily sufficient to bring about its completion , yet - true to form - the suggestion is to spend even more . #% I wish to assure him that the aim of the European Union is to encourage progress in the process of democratization and the protection of human rights in Turkey . #% This procedure is not perfect , but it is more responsive than codecision and ensures informed scientific analysis and risk assessment , rather than risking emotive concerns guiding European decisions in technical areas . #% Surely in this era of competition we should permit public airports to compete with private airports for the generation of air travel business , because at the end of the day it will mean cheaper air prices for consumers . #% The proposal from the Committee diminished the safeguards in the original Commission proposal by allowing the funding of research on so-called supernumerary embryos , with no prohibition on funding activities which would be contrary to the Oviedo Convention ( i.e. cloning for research and germ-line intervention ) . #% I welcome our President-in-Office here this afternoon . #% Finally , I know that the Euratom programme is not part of the EC programme and is not subject to codecision , but I would welcome an assurance from the Commissioner that the Commission will reflect European Parliament concerns in its activities , and in particular our amendments to the Euratom programme . #% I am deeply concerned at Iran 's lack of cooperation with regard to the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue and that there are no signs of the enforcement of Iran 's commitment within this dialogue to strengthen respect for human rights and the rule of law . #% There must be an organised and negotiated handover of responsibility to the Palestinian Authority . #% This trade agreement , I understand , could potentially cut across moves to stop this oil being imported into Europe . #% To an ordinary person that is a lot of money . #% Ireland has benefited enormously over the past ten years and we have made very good use of our structural funds . #% In the end the single currency will prove an asset to the Community . #% I do not share the Member 's general views as expressed on Article 235 . #% I wish however today to make some remarks on the policy side arising from what Mr Prodi has said . #% I would also like to ask a supplementary question . #% Along with my two colleagues from Northern Ireland , I recently brought a representative of a company in Northern Ireland to meet Commission officials about a new product which can significantly reduce emission levels now , with the additional benefit of reducing overall fuel consumption . #% We have got a new word in our vocabulary now : the ` Belarus necklace ' , applicable to a generation of children have had their throats slit from ear to ear to deal with their thyroid cancer . #% My last point is that our legal services have drafted an opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with regard to the ability of using Article 95 . #% The Commission did not actually deliver on what was promised in relation to the testing ban , as has already been pointed out by Mr Davies . #% The point I am making here is that there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic providing we make the policy choices now about what we are going to face in the future . #% I know that the presidency has accepted that partnership is a key principle . #% I do not believe that any kind of militarising of the EU is in the interests of the people at large , either within Europe or within the world as a whole . #% We must not be competing with each other and we must not be dependent on the United States - or any other country which makes a far lesser effort than we do - to design the policies to which we will contribute . #% The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly . #% Now , with Pat Cox as our President , we must confront it from day one . #% To keep my record clean I should say that my question has already been asked by Mr Howitt . #% The Commission and the EU as a whole have to deal with this . #% Therefore I would hope that we maintain our emphasis on life-long learning . #% We need to think about that again in more detail when we consider the health programmes themselves . #% I believe that clarity is lacking . #% 
The use of the GDP criterion overestimates Ireland 's true position . #% We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade . #% We now have mistakes to make up for . #% In this respect I believe that EU standard setting on the basic qualifications and retraining programmes for driving examiners is a positive development . #% That can give Ireland a value added income of approximately # 300m at today 's prices and that is three times the amount our sheep farmers are able to earn from the entire production of sheep in Ireland at the moment . #% Mr President , it is really important that we produce a recommendation for minimum distances from people 's homes for mobile phone masts . #% It is particularly important to insist on the application of directives which come under a Commission remit other than the internal market . #% One of the goals of the international year is to create the right conditions for more sports-based development programmes and projects . #% After all the stocks need our help . #% The report by Vaclav Havel and Desmond Tutu makes a real , legal and valid case for bringing the Burma issue to the UN Security Council , and I support it . #% You have referred to the four dimensions in the Nice annex , the debate on competencies , the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments . #% I am glad to hear you say , Commissioner , that agriculture is still of huge importance . #% The WTO has set up a committee on regional trade agreements to monitor new and existing regional trade groupings . #% Farmers , vets and politicians all shared the great concern of the general public over the death and destruction of millions of animals , of which many , if not most , were not infected with the disease . #% It is one step less than we would like , because we want observer status and we request that . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate Mr Cunha . #% Let us be clear : this was a choice between no information and providing information to the workforce in the process of a takeover or merger . #% These people represent 10 % of the population , yet they are excluded from so many walks of life . #% One of the things I noticed throughout the ACP-EU partnership debate was the lack of emphasis on education . #% Finally , I must say that there is a need for conservation . #% The Palestinian side has also been unable to fulfil many of its commitments on the issue of future security . #% We need to look at our position as regards developing countries . #% I support Mrs Attwooll 's appeal for the A75 . #% It is time we stopped allowing counterfeiters a free ride at the expense of consumers , legitimate businesses , EU jobs and the EU 's competitiveness . #% But up to three could be none , one or two as well as three . #% This legislation is just a Band-Aid in terms of the necessity out there . #% Mr President , I welcome the proposal to choose 1990 as the reference year . #% However , taxpayers want to see better value for money . #% I believe that bringing to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States should not mean suffering and terror for other innocent people . #% Authorities in some countries , including my own , are already planning to close down a number of landfill sites over the next two years . #% That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make , and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users . #% Remember that when we hold a referendum on this in the near future , the issues we will be asked to decide on will be of far greater complexity and importance than those related to Nice . #% When imports of beef into the EU are added to domestic production , the total is almost one million tonnes higher than the internal market uptake . #% This is the price we pay for the policy of seeking to maintain the population of the European Union in the rural areas . #% The extraordinary thing is that the Irish Government has now had to reverse its decision to deport that young man and , having declared that it regrets making a mistake , has now issued him with a six-month visa . #% This is not a policy that is in transition but rather a policy that we will have for the foreseeable future , particularly with the imminent enlargement , and we must simplify the whole policy so that these funds can be spent . #% The examples are there for all to see . #% The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States , to ease the bureaucratic burden on them to establish compliance with the tax codes of the states in which they are operating . #% But are we crazy ? #% We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity . #% I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life . #% Thus , issues far beyond the actual content of the petition have been raised . #% The report refers to the forthcoming impact assessment on the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base . #% In fact , the prospect of a free market in cars was one of the most talked-about issues dangled tantalisingly in front of our citizens as we embarked on the single market in Ireland , in any case . #% I am sure that people in this House have firm opinions on this matter . #% I eagerly await the conclusion of the Commission report of the impact of body scanners . #% In fact , I am surprised that your words about social models have caused such a stir . #% In light of Commissioner Byrne ' s statements , let us look at the words of the Permanent Working Group of European Junior Doctors : `` Research demonstrates that sustained wakefulness such as that experienced by junior doctors ( working excessive hours ) , reduces performance to a level similar to excessive alcohol consumption . '' #% Their action or lack of action has led to an understandable but justified consumer resistance with beef consumption at one point dropping by 27 % . #% I have had seven years to observe Charlie 's distaste for wasting taxpayers ' money on social services . #% It could be the beginning of a race to the bottom in exactly the same way as we have seen in Europe , where the EU Commission itself endorses the rights of private companies providing services to exploit workers , as proven when the Commission took the Luxembourg state to court for wanting migrant service workers to be given the same protection as Luxembourgish workers . #% This appalling saga has already gone on for far too long . #% Unless the root causes of conflict are addressed , no peaceful solution can be secured between the opposing sides . #% It is disgraceful that the affluent West has now added trade in human flesh to its consumer excesses . #% I am aware of the fact , for instance , that teachers in Ireland have acquired skills at their own expense . #% In the discharge procedure we expect to make a political decision on the performance of the Commission . #% I was quite surprised that I was going to be censored like this . #% I have no special quarrel with the Spanish , French or British fishermen who come into what are natural waters . #% I would therefore call for the regulation governing the new financial perspective from 2007 to expressly require Member States to demonstrate that true additionality is delivered to the regions in whose name funding is claimed from Europe . #% In some cases it set TACs at double , or even treble , the recommendations . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Gallagher , the rapporteur , for this report on the Commission proposal for the renewal of the tuna agreement with Madagascar for a further three years . #% Mr President , it is a time of crisis in the Middle East but also perhaps a time of opportunity . #% The police I met with are doing an excellent job and being assisted by new software technology designed again by a local company in my constituency , Surf Control . #% However , we must not use this failure to secure an agreement as an excuse to block , hinder or stymie the efforts that can currently be made . #% One way of choking off the effectiveness of the Ombudsman 's office and the Petitions Committee is to deny them adequate resources . #% That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were . #% 
The biggest scandal surrounding this tragedy was the British decision rightly to ban the use of contaminated meat and bonemeal in the UK but , at the same time , allow and even increase the volume of infected feed which was exported to other Member States , with disastrous consequences for innocent farmers including specifically in my own country , Ireland . #% Madam President , I should like to begin - as other colleagues have done today - with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland . #% Your path of non-violence has finally , please God , won forever the sort of peace we have all been praying for in Northern Ireland for a great many years . #% The most recent estimates of the annual wild meat harvest are 23 500 tonnes in Sarawak , 67 000 to 164 000 tonnes in the Brazilian Amazon and between one million and five million tonnes -- off the bone -- in the Congo Basin . #% The individuals concerned adhere to one or other religion , or have no religion , but their objectives are political , and the one common thing that unites them is their contempt for democracy and humanity . #% There was a recent case in Ireland in relation to Pandora , which said it did not want to transport live animals any more , presumably for economic reasons . #% I quote one of the most famous Americans , Thomas Jefferson , when he said , ` I have never considered a difference of opinion in politics , in religion , in philosophy , as a cause for withdrawing from a friendship ' . #% We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process . #% It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer . #% He wants to be the creator . #% Therefore there are limited indigenous outlets to use recycling packaging in the manufacture of new packaging . #% According to the most recent Eurostat estimate , average income per full-time job equivalent , adjusted to inflation , fell by 0.6 % in Ireland in 2003 , compared to an average increase of 0.9 % in the EU as a whole . #% If Member States make commitments to implement the matters which affect life and death than we have to find ways of ensuring that they comply with those commitments . #% I believe that we have an obligation not to disappoint them . #% I appeal to you , Madam President , to use your good offices to impress upon the Commission the concern of this House about the impact of the atrocities of 11 September in Europe where thousands , if not millions , of jobs are at risk . #% This is especially relevant in view of the remarks of the French Finance Minister with regard to the impact of abolition on employment and the stated intention of the incoming German presidency who said that they will push for a lengthy delay . #% If anything , we have failed those people who are the most vulnerable - the long-term unemployed - by what we have put in place over the last five years . #% One final point : ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman 's statute , there is clearly a need for a review . #% Before plenary , I contacted both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch again . #% They are quite small , there is not a lot of money in them , but they are in danger of fragmentation if things continue like this . #% Revenues from international roaming charges total about EUR 10 billion and regulation should save the consumer between 40 % and 60 % . #% Tax harmonisation is not an acceptable idea for example to my delegation so you can not promulgate ideas which are not politically acceptable . #% On an overall level , payments in the 2007 budget must reach 1.04 % of EU GNI if we are to deliver effective programmes to our citizens . #% We do not even use the money that is available in the European Union as well as we could . #% We are talking equality and not dominance here . #% She knows my country very well , and there will be great distress when they hear she is ill and unable to continue her work here in Parliament . #% Let me make one further point on this . #% As I know from my own experience , the principles at the heart of European Union will resolve conflict wherever they are applied in the world . #% The international community , in particular the United Nations , has to ask itself some searching and probing questions . #% There is quite considerable concern in the Member States that too often Christmas , which should be a time of joy , is a time of tragedy . #% For two years , during the development cooperation instrument process , we tried to persuade the Commission and others that we were really in the business of trying to find a really good instrument . #% It is not possible in such a short time to give any meaningful background to the situation in Northern Ireland , but like any area where there is conflict , it is always a complex situation . #% As we have seen , ideas that fit one part of Europe will not work in another part . #% I would also like to state , and strongly reinforce , the difficulty that we have in the European Union on arriving at an energy policy within a proper legal base , without a proper legal base in the Treaty on European Union . #% At this moment , I do not insist on a particular outcome , although I reserve the right to continue questioning the technical and political dimensions . #% The EU , through the Globalisation Fund , has allocated a fund that will directly help the economically vulnerable in the area . #% I am confident that this Irish presidency will deliver on its priorities as it has consistently done in the past and give the lie to the myth that the small states can not effectively handle the assignment . #% I did meet with his colleague , Mrs Kinnock , earlier today and she gave me an up-to-date report on her visit there and I am also making a note of the comments he has made from his visit there . #% And it is ridiculous to speak about how we must do more at European level when at the same time you will not increase the budget that is available to the European Union to undertake this work , despite the fact that the numbers of people involved in the European Union and the number of countries involved in the European Union has increased . #% I commend the resolution to the House . #% For all our aircraft in the middle to large categories we are now in basic agreement . #% Gaza is isolated enough without cutting off accurate media reporting . #% There seems to be a misunderstanding between the British and German authorities . #% This is a cruel blow for all those who faithfully served the industry for generations . #% But the standard of chicken , not only from the Far East but also from other parts of the world , is seriously questionable . #% I pass this piece of advice to you , Commissioner : if you want to smoothly facilitate free and easy movement of services throughout our 25 countries , I would n't start from here . #% I should like to ask him if he is aware that , notwithstanding the implementation of many of the Community programmes , in a recent BBC television programme Newsnight there was clear evidence that there is a systematic breeding programme in Romania in particular , where children are being bred for export and sale . #% So most of these questions are very much in their embryonic stages and have not reached the stage where the Council has considered them . #% Mrs Aelvoet has dealt with the issue of the date . #% If the principle of additionality is not rigorously enforced and independently verified , it makes it very difficult for European Union institutions and national EU governments to ensure that the competitive position of those regions most in need is improved . #% Let us represent the peace , the tolerance and the acceptance that the European Union should truly represent . #% Evaluating biotechnology is not the same as evaluating the ethical implications of patent applications . #% I hope that goes for the people of Spain as well . #% I therefore welcome today 's debate and I welcome the positive contribution we are trying to make in combating unemployment . #% They exist all over Europe . #% The Delors package has not been so long in existence . #% I commend this motion to the House . #% You refer to the fact that gaps exist and you wish to address to them but the greatest gap is that in the willingness of your collegiate body to come before this House constantly in an open , transparent and clear way . #% I can not understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I can not understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50 % self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information , that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk . #% This , in our view , is a bad legislative proposal because it is too complex . #% I can not offer the same praise to the Council of Ministers , because in our committee we have seen a whole succession of very large cuts with no rationale whatsoever provided as to why they should have taken place . #% It is very good to start the work of this new Parliament with programmes which can make a difference , both to the environment and , of course , to the competitiveness needs of our Member States . #% Finally , I would add that the EU fund should also be available to the many other victims of the IRA , who for years have been denied justice because of this same intimidation . #% Mr President , we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people . #% This would result in the cost of maternity leave in the UK doubling . #% Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report . #% 
The car industry states that the framework allows it to move forward more quickly , that a directive will slow down implementation . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the guiding principles of this directive , namely the safety of the consumer and the single market . #% Mr President , financial assistance to the applicant states to help advance the process of enlargement is clearly needed . #% I hope that my successors will achieve something that can be understood by European citizens . #% We must be very careful with regard to that issue . #% The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult , if not impossible , proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum . #% Cattle farming has always been a low-profit enterprise and even with generous EC subsidy many farmers are not making an acceptable profit . #% The current practice of providing a 10-mile zone could and should be extended to 15 miles without serious disadvantage to the EU deep-sea fleets . #% Any EU Member States , including mine , can make mistakes . #% A debate at this time would only suit the many Members in this House who are opposed to giving the eastern and central Europeans the opportunity to share in the economic growth we are enjoying in the European Union . #% Mrs Doyle 's point on infants is a really serious question because infant formula is being mixed with water that has been fluoridated , and I believe that there are serious consequences for children here . #% It is not enough simply to have occasional , carefully-edited reports presented to this House every now and then over the next six months . #% What would the people of the candidate countries be basing their decision in next year 's referenda on ? #% But , as a mother , I mostly beseech those with information on the thugs who perpetrated this act to come forward . #% I have consistently supported the view that the Commission 's best friend is the European Parliament . #% But , while one sees the US hospital ships there , all we see from the EU is Member States going in from Belgium and Ireland and Britain or wherever . #% I believe it would be a mistake to try to push that through again . #% Members have mentioned the question of comitology . #% I must say that I admire the technicians and other people who have been criticised here . #% I also commend her recommendations to this House , and indeed share her concerns . #% He also claimed that I leave Strasbourg early . #% It is vital that consumer interests be protected in these areas . #% I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States . #% We need to try to restore not only the pleasure of flying but also the sense of safety that people have when they board an aircraft and go from place to place . #% Why then is Ireland gradually forging closer and closer links with an alliance committed to , and endowed with , a nuclear capability ? #% And although no case of TSE in fish had ever been discovered , the feeding of fishmeal to ruminants was also subjected to a temporary ban . #% I hope that Member States will see fit to transpose all elements of this important directive before the final deadline for implementation in order to give parents , as consumers , greater peace of mind . #% The EU faces charges of protectionism . #% Direct financial aid and the transfer of technology and expertise to developing countries are the hallmarks of the European Union 's development policy . #% The Cohesion Fund is an invaluable tool in helping less well-off Member States catch up , particularly in the development of infrastructure networks and upgrading of water supplies , in order to contribute to the long-term sustainable development of disadvantaged regions . #% As far as Kyoto is concerned , there are only three things you can do in order to diminish CO2 emissions : one is to rely on nuclear energy - but there are very big risks and problems involved in that ; secondly , you use energy more rationally and , thirdly , you turn to renewable energy sources . #% As some people here have mentioned in relation to the European arrest warrant , there should be pre-conditions attached to that . #% I can not see how people can justify voting against such principles . #% Michael Courtney was known to many of us here in Strasbourg when he served as Observer to this Parliament . #% It simply passes around as it chooses . #% For example , India described its only nuclear test as a ` peaceful nuclear explosion ' , but it still used the results to develop its weapons programme . #% Mr President , it is clear that more initiatives will have to be implemented if the European Union is to become the most knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% Decisions of this nature are largely a matter for Member States and the European Parliament must respect subsidiarity . #% Obviously I am referring here to the UK , Sweden and Denmark . #% How can we avoid the situation that , when they come under pressure in India , they move to China to carry on exactly the same trade ? #% I personally met with the Foreign Affairs Minister of San Marino within the last ten days and we had a very worthwhile exchange . #% Subsidies for traditional forms of energies have been intense and are partly responsible for limited progress on renewables . #% In conclusion , can I say that on a broader level it is important that the European Union , as an economic entity , does not fall behind in the global search for e-commerce opportunities . #% In that regard there is the question of the free movement of labour . #% Mr President , it is regrettable , of course , that the first news we had of this report was in the media , as happened last year . #% There are questions as to whether in fact the United Kingdom is in breach of EU regulations . #% We have the legislation in Ireland , we have the minimum wage , but we are not properly enforcing that legislation . #% Why on earth , then , were we given the powers to do so ? #% In Ireland the level of alcohol abuse by young people has grown dramatically over the years . #% As we move towards enlargement of the European Union , with the accession of new Member States , and extend freedom of movement opportunities to countries outside of the accession countries to deal with shortfalls of medical personnel across the European Union , we consider that experts in the field from the existing Member States must be included in any such consultation process . #% Mr Nordmann - I congratulate him on his report - is correct to cite the need to tighten fraud detection systems in the countries of origin . #% I am puzzled by the Council 's excessive caution . #% We need a European ferries directive to ensure that Irish Ferries and other companies like it can not ride roughshod over the rights of workers present and future . #% I am leaning in favour of it , but the scientific and practical doubts remain . #% Mr President , first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants . #% The starting point is indisputable but many views , including my own , differ as to the quantification of the state of stocks . #% There is no satisfactory definition of fundamentalism , no adequate basis , no common ground . #% The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden , an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror , not only this year , but in recent years too . #% We abdicate some of our own individual rights and freedoms in the interests of the common good to make sure that our world , our countries , our towns are better and safer places . #% On any of these issues we must be very careful that we do not come out in a rush of Christian frenzy , thinking that we are going to solve all of the problems of all of the crime in the European Union simply by setting up another institution or another office with more staff , and coordinating and harmonising more power into a central authority . #% It has been suggested in this debate that Members should vote against this report because it might have a negative effect on the Nice referendum in Ireland . #% I would like to congratulate them warmly . #% Finally , there are approximately 600 , 000 refugees missing in the region . #% The Irish situation is an excellent case study in point . #% The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate , embarrassingly inadequate . #% This is an interesting development . #% 
It is time to move on . #% The major financiers who would be interested in cherrypicking the key commuter belt rail services are not interested in providing rail services in the western corridor of the island of Ireland , for instance . #% Jean Monnet , a much respected founding father of the European Union , campaigned for the establishment of the European Economic Community because it would be a means to ensure that the continent of Europe would be at peace with itself , as opposed to engaging in war . #% Choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one 's children is a very basic human right . #% As everyone knows , environmental issues cross all boundaries . #% I know I indicated that I wished to speak before other colleagues who spoke -- good luck to them . #% He is a European of the first rank . #% If Amendment No 45 does not fall , I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services . #% So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living . #% The package is , as the Commissioner said , a response to the European Parliament , which is in turn responding to the very real fears and concerns of European citizens , as is our duty -- my voice sounds rather similar to yours , Commissioner , I apologise : I too have a cold . #% He acknowledged that the meetings with Mr Solana were helpful , but urged more meetings , more discussions and more debate because of the very difficult and strange times which exist at present . #% That is disgraceful . #% Mr President , there are economic frontiers within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time . #% The common agricultural policy is a uniform European-wide programme . #% But will we be back here in a year , or in five years , or are we are last going to deliver on donor commitments to a poor country that simply can not be left on its knees any longer ? #% But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report . #% You may believe that if the Constitution were adopted during the Irish presidency , it would have a better chance of success in an Irish referendum . #% One thing that we have all recognised in the past is that we have not made proper provision for the future needs of changing demographics , a reducing workforce in certain cases and limits in taxation expenditure . #% I would ask you , as you have always done in the past , to find the time for an emergency debate on this matter . #% Could you provide us with information on that ? #% The proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals . #% Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem . #% Mr President , I wish to acknowledge the Commission decision to provide ECU 650 million compensation package for farmers who have and still do experience serious financial losses resulting from BSE . #% But it would be wilful carnage to simply go in and slaughter good animals in the thought or the notion that BSE may possibly be in the whole herd . #% I am dealing specifically with the employment aspects of the matter as opposed to compensatory aid . #% We in the EU know more than any other part of the world how untrammelled free trade can be controlled through multilateral rule-making to the benefit of our citizens . #% It has always been in the Council 's remit to consider ways of addressing the public 's fears . #% This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010 . #% Looking at the different Presidency programmes -- whether the Finnish Presidency , the previous Austrian Presidency or even the advance programme for the German Presidency -- we can often see continuity in one area , but we can also see the individuality of the country taking over the Presidency . #% Public opinion in Europe was clearly divided over the question of invading Iraq . #% We need to revisit the issue of special exemptions on reduced rates . #% It is my own view that , if there is no measurable progress soon on the demands in this resolution , then the European Union must bring economic and political pressure to bear on the regime in Sri Lanka . #% The euro is good news for European businesses . #% You referred to the point that relative stability and special unique circumstances can not be taken into consideration . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the establishment of courts to try the suspects of the former Communist Khmer Rouge regime . #% I do not believe such a move is in the best interests of the future of the Union . #% The focus will be for on-farm forestry , with grants , planting and maintenance , as well as income-support premium . #% It is time to call a halt to the ideologically driven forced march towards liberalisation and privatisation . #% Forced labour continues , despite agreements with the ILO . #% I do not think that Mr Robin Cook is pursuing an ethical foreign policy , as he promised . #% I take it from the Commissioner 's response that basically , if letters of formal notice have been sent out and no subsequent legal action has been taken , citizens in Ireland who want copies of letters sent to the Irish Government can in fact get them . #% Last night Commissioner Byrne rejected the idea that the pharmaceutical industry had anything to do with this , but I wonder why they are so interested in getting this through if that is not the case ? #% Are we seriously willing to sacrifice not only our climate and planet , but also our economies ? #% This would require the Commission to make a decision that compensation can be given for new processing methods without actually taking away the structure of the manufacturing capacity that is available for these alternative fuels in many Member States . #% Mr President , a number of speakers tonight have mentioned the issue of the best available technology . #% As Mrs Ahern said , some improvements have been made , but the reality is that we have to take into account the experience in the United States which has created multi-million and multi-billion dollar legal suits by large companies against small companies , which have stifled innovation , prevented new invention and prevented job creation . #% That is not serving the interests of the British nation in my view and therefore I will oppose that report . #% I do not understand why the Commission is playing into the hands of the Member States . #% It will have an adverse effect on our agriculture , our farmers and our fishermen . #% On the 60th anniversary of Auschwitz , it is very important that we remember and honour the Jewish victims and the other national victims , like the Poles , Russians etc. , who died in Auschwitz . #% Mr President , it is good to have hope but it must not misplaced and it must not blind us to reality . #% I would like any policy on tourism to try and address this question , because balanced regional development has been a priority in EU policy and I have always believed that this should also be linked to tourism policy . #% I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive . #% We must all work together . #% We must do so , however , in an enlightened and informed way and be prepared to avail ourselves of modern research and technology in achieving this objective . #% A few weeks will give us an opportunity to produce a motion calling for and justifying the closure of Guantánamo Bay , in a form that can be supported by all of the main groups , with increased credibility in the build up to the EU-US Summit in late June . #% We also must remember that waste does not disappear . #% We must get it right and I am confident that we can . #% Doubtless all our thoughts are with her family at this very difficult time . #% We can not go back to burying people , we have to move forward in peace together and to do that we have to maintain political authority . #% Mr President , as Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel has said , research has consistently been identified as the key to improving economic growth , creating new jobs , a cleaner environment and better health . #% Some children are fortunate enough to receive this care from secondary care-givers like fathers , grandparents , other relatives , close neighbours - people who are committed to them and part of their life on an ongoing basis . #% Mr President , first of all I should like as usual to congratulate Mr Telkämper . #% For the Council not to do this would add the injury of indifference to the insult of refusing from the outset to provide adequate finance . #% , in writing . - Some things are black and white . #% Anyone who has watched the way in which Mrs van den Burg has worked on this directive will appreciate the enormous amount of commitment and expertise that had to be brought to it . #% 
We have therefore voted to that effect . #% After the defeat of the Tamil Tigers , the nightmare continues for the Tamil people , especially in the north of Sri Lanka , with 300 000 people - including 31 000 children - forcefully detained in camps where disease and malnutrition are rife . #% Would he not agree that he should be leading to ensure that in the light of international terrorism he takes a positive role and does not try to duck out of this position ? #% We , too , believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism . #% This is best shown by the scale of debt that they now owe . #% Let us do all in our power to stop the carnage on our roads . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the first thing I want to make clear here tonight is that this is not about third-country imports . #% Let us not forget that the Growth Pact itself can not be seen in isolation : it must also be seen in coordination with the broad economic policy guidelines that are laid down . #% Finally , if we reject the Commission proposal , we will end up with bad law . #% I would like to make a few comments concerning the outcome of the recent Irish referendum , that was held on the Nice Treaty . #% Therefore , the context of concentration and consistency , referring to Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) areas , is somewhat restrictive and let me say why that is so . #% You will realise that , President , having been an active member of the Committee on Fisheries in the past . #% The public must be made aware that it is often the practice of governments and the Council of Ministers to blame the Commission when things go wrong . #% I would also ask that the Commission take note of the fact that the European people would welcome Mr Mobutu as much as they would the greatest criminal . #% I have made a complaint to you regarding the illegal waste dumps found in Wicklow . #% It will not be an acceptable excuse that we halt the march to Union by sacrificing important principles in order to keep some or other blocking Member State on board . #% In particular , the new laws must not violate the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , nor must they in any way undermine the independence of the Hong Kong courts and their right to exercise the power of final jurisdiction . #% Mr President , could we be assured that the Minister will also take on board the question regarding an amendment to the Treaty protecting the rights of children ? #% It seems to me as well that there is an urgent need for this Parliament to be treated as a parliament and for the secrecy in relation to these negotiations to end . #% I also welcome the proposal for the political pillar of ASEM to encourage political dialogue in several areas , including between China and Taiwan . #% There is a huge gap in consumer knowledge . #% I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution . #% He is subject to very severe , cruel and unusual restrictions on his liberty . #% We must call Milosevic 's bluff . #% There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq . #% The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 last month calling for the deployment of more than 22 000 peacekeepers in the region . #% Madam President , I echo the remarks of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , Mr von Wogau , with regard to the procedure in this matter . #% In the midst of the crisis the pig industry was robbed in one night of 40 % of its slaughter capacity and curing capacity . #% We are supporting illegal weapons and we really have to look at this . #% Now , in a quite appalling legislative move , the British Government , in delivery of a sordid deal with the IRA , is proposing to afford amnesty and sanctuary to those on-the-run terrorists . #% Let me quote BNFL 's own words : `` At company level it has been recognised that in the mind of many stake holders quality and safety are inextricably linked . #% While not detracting from the seriousness of the situation , the impact on consumer confidence has been far greater in my view than the actual threat to public health . #% in writing . - I supported the Maňka Report on the European Parliament amending budget while conscious of the sensitivity of increasing budgets at a time when citizens are being asked to take pay cuts and jobs are being lost . #% Updating this law is not enough . #% I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain . #% I see this particular proposal as upholding the principles of the single market , and I am convinced that it will lead to cheaper cars for EU citizens . #% I hope that will be forthcoming . #% Parliament should be informed , Member States should open up this discussion so that people in the Member States know what is going on before it is too late . #% Finally , the report lets the UK off the hook . #% On the first thirty pages , I was not able to find a single site for the European Union . #% The European Parliament does not operate on a knee-jerk , reflex system . #% This will give a green light to secret services to put under surveillance people whose activities are entirely democratic and legal . #% However , it is vital that the same standards apply to imported foodstuffs , otherwise the antibiotics only just banned in the EU could make their way back onto our plates . #% I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the win by his home team in football today . #% If I am a cripple in Ireland , I am a cripple in Europe . #% Natural habitats were destroyed . #% I appreciate the response already given by the Council and Commission , but we need to have this criminal traffic in children and in the portrayal of children in a violent , abusive and obscene manner stopped . #% From an Irish perspective , while we are satisfied that economic progress has been made in recent years , there is need to underpin this progress . #% There are now elements of both legal and political certainty with regard to the enlargement negotiations . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Adam for this exceptional report . #% Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee . #% In order to counter this unacceptable situation , government needs to step in with stronger regulation and resourcing of the relevant consumer protection agencies . #% Communications , education , access to modern methods , application of sound medical advice and bridging gaps in the issue of public health at Member State level are vital . #% It is regression not progress : that is an issue of substance . #% When we hear talk about utilising jurisprudence in the work that is being done with regard to the European Convention on Human Rights and building on that , of course we should all be heartened to hear that our laws and our policies will be guided by those principles . #% I strongly believe that consumers , once again , are going to be forced to bear the high cost of these licences . #% It is frequently difficult for temporary residents to obtain local insurance cover at a reasonable price . #% I am concerned that the WTO may be pushing for trade without due concern to animal health and human health implications . #% With the liberalization of the whole air transport sector , it is imperative that we have common standards on training and licensing of cabin crews throughout the Union . #% Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel 's compliance with human rights provisions , nothing tangible has been done , to my knowledge . #% Jerusalem should not be regarded as an Arab city or a Jewish city , a Christian city or a Muslim city . #% It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives . #% This resolution emphasizes a high-profile case in the necessary fight by the international community to bring an end to the scourge of people committing human rights abuses with impunity , anywhere in the world . #% These plasma products , particularly in the UK and Ireland , are largely imported from the US from paid donors . #% Indeed part of my own constituency in Dublin which some might think is a favoured region is one of those . #% No cures are currently available for neurodegenerative diseases and knowledge about prevention , treatment , and identification of risk factors is very limited . #% 
The debate boils down to the powers of the EU institutions versus the competence of Member States . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner could say whether it is possible to look at those criteria in a cross-comparative way , because I fear that we will neither fall within the Objective 1 criteria on raw GDP , nor perhaps be eligible under defined unemployment statistics for Objective 2 after 1999 , in which case we will fall between both stools . #% Madam President , I would say to President Barroso that it is true the first five years of Lisbon have delivered little and most Member States , which bear the ultimate responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Agenda , have been very slow to take ownership . #% We have an internal market , we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States . #% That will is to say : ' Let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' . #% Charles Taylor is being protected and given asylum status in Nigeria at present , despite the fact that Nigeria has ratified the Geneva Convention which states that those that have committed war crimes may not be granted refugee status . #% Our finance ministers are going to bring forward proposals outlining a timetable for the implementation of the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering . #% The public has lost confidence in the national and European food safety systems after the scandals and scares with beef , E.coli , lysteria , salmonella , dioxins , eggs , poultry , milk and hormones . #% I thank him for raising it in the way he has . #% Drug cartels in Colombia and Afghanistan are in contact . #% When you look at the health effects of tobacco and smoking it is quite clear that the number of people who die as a result of tobacco is very high . #% Finally , the promotion of encryption can not be a substitute for efforts to find political solutions - more strict legal guarantees and effective parliamentary control , for example . #% The draft Treaty will form a basis for the final EU Treaty which will be put in place at the IGC in the near future . #% We have spent the last three or four years talking about cutting back on spending at European level , freezing the budget and maintaining the present rate of spending . #% At the same time , margins have been squeezed for fishermen . #% We cover the energy programmes , those relating to industry , including small and medium firms , the research programmes under the framework programmes which of course amount to more or less 60 % of the internal policy expenditure of the European Union , and the trade and technical assistance lines . #% The necessity to follow up the catch into the marketplace to make sure that we know exactly where the fish that are marketed in a given market are coming from is extremely important . #% Each of the national governments had nominated the people they considered to be the best for the position of Commissioner in the European Union . #% The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ( EGNOS ) is ten times more accurate than GPS and it is predicted that accuracy to 45 centimetres can be achieved in the near future . #% With both BSE and foot-and-mouth farmers by and large are innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% Seventy-eight percent have seen pictures of the euro notes and coins and 64 % know that an Irish Pound will get you EUR 1.27 . #% It is particularly important that the more than 50 % of the world 's population which is deprived of infrastructure , electricity and energy for development should be provided with decentralized infrastructures in a proper and concrete way . #% In his first report he pointed out how many people had petitioned , and which petitions were not admissible . #% In one case , I see the public taxpayer in a Member State being forced to pay through the clearance of accounts for the crimes of individual companies . #% Support must be given to the small farmers and food producers in the regions in question . #% Madam President , as rapporteur for the general regulation on the reform of the structural funds I voted against the PPE resolution and the compromise resolution . #% My question is the same as Mrs Riis-Jørgensen 's . #% Mr President , the Israeli defence forces are currently continuing with the largest incursion into Gaza since the beginning of the Intifada and death tolls are continuing to rise . #% I know that , as a skilled lawyer , you are committed to ensuring legal certainty for both business and consumers . #% It is far more important to obtain a good result than an early result . #% In conclusion , it appears that this piece of legislation will go through under the Finnish Presidency and we can avoid tying these toxic chemicals up in the REACH queue . #% It is quite clear that we are supposed to be striving to create an incentive where the animals will be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin . #% The fact of the matter is that the greater the reduction of greenhouse gases , the greater the effect it has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities , not only in Europe but world-wide . #% I passed it on Saturday evening and noticed an already impressive stack of refrigerators that had accumulated in less than ten weeks . #% The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree . #% It is believed that something rather nasty may have died in the works - a large rat or even a small mouse - but we hope that by this afternoon it will have been cleared up . #% So we need to look very carefully at how that reserve would work . #% Perhaps we should hand out landmines to everyone in the House , because it is not dissimilar to saying that drugs are not dangerous . #% These are issues that need to be addressed and the Irish Government and its agencies need to be cross-examined by this committee , as , indeed , do many other Member States . #% I very much welcome the participation of representatives from the parliaments of the applicant countries in the Convention and look forward to the fresh insight they will bring to its workings . #% Nothing they have said nor any utterances from Harbinson 's mouth leave me with confidence that we are going to benefit from playing our cards up front . #% Madam President , on a point of order , did you expend the full 20 minutes on oral questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel ? #% It has also used inhumane cluster bombs . #% I also acknowledge and salute the defence which you , together with the European Commission , have mounted on the climate-change issue . #% I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement . #% The protocol of the fisheries agreement between the Union and Equatorial Guinea expired at the end of last June . #% Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets . #% Therefore , I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution . #% I appreciate that there has been rescheduling of debt but multilateral lenders do not reschedule and that is reflected in the fact that African countries owe the International Development Agency $ 25 billion compared with $ 2.58 billion in 1980 . #% This proposal also covers the important legislative initiatives in areas such as safety of blood and blood derivatives , and the implementation of wider anti-smoking campaigns . #% Studies have shown that babies - the most vulnerable members of society - are at risk . #% It will also take into account the principles of sustainable or environmentally friendly development set out in the Gothenburg strategy . #% I remind the honourable Member that what I said is that the Asia-Oceania Working Group is examining the issue in the light of discussions held by the ministers at the General Affairs Council earlier this week . #% These private , profit-orientated organisations have far too much power over sovereign governments and I fully support plans to address this anomaly at European level . #% In supporting totally Mr Evans ' report , I would like to make a couple of comments . #% We need more time to look at the evaluation and to ensure that the proper operation takes place . #% We must have an early-warning system in place to pinpoint areas of potential disagreement at the earliest possible moment . #% I welcome the fact that European Union is prepared to play an active role in third-party monitoring operations in the Middle East and I believe that the European Union must and should play a stronger role in any future talks that may take place in the Middle East region . #% The consensus this morning amongst most groups shows that the Commissioner is quite right to take further the regulatory body that she has in mind and she has seen that there is a wish to have that strengthened . #% Either all countries comply with the rules and have confidence in the system or we will have a credibility problem with regard to the issue for an indefinite period . #% There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.3 . #% The Commission first submitted a proposal in 1991 , which was withdrawn after Parliament , under pressure from environmental groups , rejected the Council 's common position in 1996 . #% The force majeure provision is also necessary until a liquid trading market emerges . #% We might still be in a legal quagmire unless we have a proper interinstitutional agreement . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , the Commissioner says that these are ` ambitious goals ' . #% All of this is false . #% 
The issue is one of particular importance to Ireland , as it is the only island state in the Union and relies heavily on the availability of low cost airfares . #% This remains a concern of mine . #% Mr President , the House will recall that I , along with other Members , have raised on a number of occasions , the incarceration of Roisín McAliskey , who is seven months pregnant , in a category A jail . #% This was the first step in rebuilding the relationship between the US and the European Union . #% The nature and timing of the arrests lead me to detect a cynical attempt by the authorities to spread fear in advance of the elections due to be held next year . #% If you have a Renaissance masterpiece you handle it with far more care than a magazine poster . #% By virtue of the fact that they were actually living on an island that was a British island , they should have rights as EU citizens . #% This should provide , for example , for the establishment of a European coastguard service to tackle the drugs problem , which is a dreadful blight on all our communities . #% Is the Commission not , in fact , permitted and indeed obliged to make a submission to the European Court of Justice with regard to its view on the issues at stake in that case ? #% As currently framed they would be disastrous for Irish agriculture and the towns and villages of rural Ireland . #% I also welcome this report by Mr Chanterie . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Maat on his efforts because he tried hard to reach consensus . #% Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region . #% Mr President , this period is an important opportunity for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples . #% In terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no real consequence , the environmental impact remains . #% So I would urge the Commission that we should have a much tighter timeframe . #% I would like to welcome initiatives taken by the Irish government , including diverting 50 % of all household waste away from landfill sites , reducing by up to 65 % biodegradable waste consigned to landfill , developing broader waste recovery facilities and reducing methane emissions by up to 80 % . #% The European Union does have competence in research and technological development - Title XVII of the EC Treaty . #% Mr President , we are all agreed that Mr Schulz has produced an excellent and comprehensive report on the measures which need to be taken to combat child sex tourism and to reinforce the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children . #% We have to keep that separate . #% Proposals to tighten ELVs are not proportionate regarding costs and benefits and fail to recognise that the common position is a balance between improving environmental performance and avoiding excessive costs and other impacts . #% The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication . #% I will support the conditional motion of censure if the Commission does not satisfy our demands . #% Glancing through a scientific report on the status of fish stocks makes for very depressing reading these days . #% In Brazil this year , for example , while hurricanes thousands of miles away battered the United States and the Caribbean with water and wind , residents of a small fishing town deep in the Amazon region watched the lake on which they depend for food and transportation shrivel away in a year which saw the region 's worst drought in four decades : the result of warmer ocean water , which has also been blamed for one of the most violent hurricane seasons on record in the Gulf of Mexico . #% We need to ensure as far as we can that freight is removed from our roads and is placed onto alternative means of transport . #% Appendix II contains most of the species regulated by the Commission . #% That is the road the presidency intends to continue going down . #% I wonder how much faster we need to move in order to achieve this equality within the next hundred years , which even then would be quite a long period to have to wait . #% Those seeds are certainly not your family 's variation ; they are an identikit Monsanto seed of a particular batch number , exactly the same seed as millions of others around the globe . #% The combined effects of this directive and the Water Framework Directive will make the Nitrates Directive wholly superfluous . #% Also , a lot of the services that should be provided for people on the Internet are not provided . #% Many women do not want to undertake motherhood without an involved father . #% Similarly , with other species of white fish , the overall figure was 58.8 % of the total allowable catch of Irish fishermen destroyed by seals one way or another . #% But with over four million abortions a year in Europe , we can not really say that our falling birth rate is primarily about infertility . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for their tremendous work on this very important piece of legislation . #% So let us meet the percentage contribution we said we would make . #% Elected representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should , at the very least , accept that their own privileges undergo the same treatment . #% My group , however , again wishes to stress the importance that this should be seen in the context of a strong Atlantic Alliance . #% We have to be very careful about telling people with disabilities what they need and what we can do for them . #% Nevertheless , I could not be more full of praise for them . #% These draft amendments would certainly seem to contravene Lithuania 's obligations under its own Constitution , the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . #% The budget for 1996 was fully implemented and no case of fraud was reported . #% I can not believe that these people have any capacity whatsoever to police their waters or in any way manage their stocks . #% I am sure the honourable Member from Northern Ireland who placed this question heard me unequivocally answer the question that he has put . #% Today the Union is much enlarged and there are only 6 million farmers . #% Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions . #% You will get a similar , Enron-style scandal as a result of all this . #% There has been no in-depth evaluation of the risks of error in the MSY model . #% In dispensing that money , we could offer to the children of many Third World countries something like the hope that we can give to our own children , something like the life expectancy and opportunities for education . #% The rest of the world will follow what the EU-25 does at the Conference of the Parties . #% The mission of democracies must be to defeat terrorism , not merely to contain or to tame it . #% It is for the Member States to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants . #% It is also an investment in the future for a greater understanding of the diversity in the European Union - cultural , social and linguistic . #% I would like to know if possible from the Commissioner what action he has taken to deal with this possible conflict in the future . #% In the current climate , it is right that we should do what we are proposing now . #% Parliaments therefore have a right to be consulted and not to be bypassed over issues that impact directly on the lives of people within the European Union . #% In the exchange of agriculture for services , Irish sugar beet farmers have lost their crop , and we have now lost the last of our sugar factories , in Mallow , in my own constituency , which closed just two weeks ago . #% It is in that context that I favour a framework directive . #% Billions of people live under the threat of persecution . #% What is happening here is that the Commission and others are bowing to the pressures of industry . #% I very much hope that the Belgian presidency will use this important time to help end the spiral of violence in the Middle East and seek the recommencement of dialogue between all parties in the region . #% Global issues of maintaining peace and security are best addressed in an effective multilateral system within a European Union working together with the US Government , the Canadian Government and our partners at the United Nations to combat international terrorism , tackle global poverty and promote democratic values . #% I am sorry to say that ` fair and free ' lost . #% To return to the urgency of the humanitarian aid : rebuilding physical infrastructure is important , but it is understandable that agencies may be hesitant to rebuild when it looks as though an even more threatening regime is taking over in Israel . #% It is important that more money is available , but it is also important that we should seek here to enhance the socially-inclusive Europe citizens clearly desire . #% 
There can be no tolerance in the Commission of fraud , corruption or financial irregularities . #% The argument is about whether GEF will be the main source of funding and where that is going to be . #% I congratulate her on it . #% Mr President , I totally disagree with Mr Schulz with regard to what Commissioner McCreevy did or did not say , because if you read the 16 different press reports on the incident in Sweden , none of it was related to the Swedish social model . #% The first is the method and measures to be used for measuring the reconstruction needs of Haiti . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to keep an open mind . #% The public ' s trust in the authorities is important to ensuring adequate responses . #% Firstly , in relation to the discrimination in the share-out of the milk quota , Ireland has a very legitimate claim in relation to additional quota . #% I should like to lay down a marker in relation to the declaration we have just heard from Commissioner Figeľ , speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dimas . #% At the same time , the CAP budget must help European farmers adapt to new challenges and opportunities . #% Government ministers oppose anti-aircraft defences and have made it clear that plants that lie in the flight paths of large airports can be shut down if they are rated as serious risk . #% Consumers are also increasingly tempted to buy even more expensive items across borders , like washing machines , fridges , financial services and cars . #% Finally , I wish to pay my compliments once again to Mrs Smet . #% The fact is that market conditions do not always provide ` must carry ' . #% Mr President , first of all there is a debate over whether the European Union should be discussing things in relation to common standards on procedural law . #% This is what blights the life of all minorities and conquered peoples within the territory that China now claims to rule . #% Structural funds are a key financial instrument . #% For example , gays and lesbians are still discriminated against in many European countries because of their sexual orientation . #% Dublin II is fast approaching , to be preceded as we have heard by an Ecofin Council next Monday in Brussels . #% Pioneering work in adult education was carried out by Professor Jim Phelan of UCD , Dr Michael Ward of UCC , Professor Michael Cuddy of UCG and Dr Ted Fleming of Maynooth . #% Future ideas must be flexible and able to adapt to the new society . #% As a society built on the imperative of Marxist domination , it is no surprise that Cuba is a bastion of repression , where dissent is crushed and freedom denied . #% But accidents in nuclear installations , especially criticality accidents , are the most feared of all accidents . #% Phasing out the use of fluorinated gases in favour of competitive alternatives is an important step towards making real environmental progress . #% We know that the British Government has done nothing to implement its obligations under the Ottawa Convention to date . #% Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations . #% Even more importantly , the failure of Sinn Féin 's leadership to ensure that justice is done in this case undermines the cause of Irish Republicanism . #% There is a great danger that President Uribe will use this as a propaganda stunt to give the impression at international level that everything is fine . #% Madam President , I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement . #% I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq . #% I appeal for urgent aid in that regard . #% Mr President , the first ever nation-wide electoral process in the history of Saudi Arabia is under way , with the local elections in Riyadh completed last month and continuing in the rest of the country until April . #% Mr President , I join in congratulating Mr Garot on his report . #% Whatever institutional and other changes take place , there will never be real progress unless and until all Member States act and speak as one . #% The difficulty and danger is that once you transfer the right and entitlement to a quota , then all production stops and sugar production is amalgamated into big multinational interests , rather than into individual national interests as at present . #% Madam President , Commissioner Prodi , Commissioner Byrne , the BSE and dioxin crises coupled with the ongoing controversy regarding genetically modified foods have combined to seriously undermine consumer confidence in the safety of food . #% In the conclusions to its communication the Commission lists among its priorities : better coherence between the various objectives pursued by the CFP , such as conservation of resources , the economic efficiency of the fleet and securing employment in fisheries - dependent areas , taking account of the economic dimension of fisheries management , better integration of environmental and fisheries policy , improvement of management tools such as multi-annual management objectives and strategies , management of fishing effort , and full integration of the Mediterranean into the Community management regime , a more accountable decision-making process and maintaining the external dimension of the common fisheries policy . #% Mr President , I should like to express concern at the Commission emphasis on large integration projects , which would impact badly on small community-based enterprises as promoted within the framework of rural development programmes and research in the agricultural and associated food sector . #% However , the success of last week 's summit in Florence will be judged by many of our constituents by what it achieved for them . #% Strictly speaking , Parliament has no direct role in the matter ; it is a matter for the Council to approve . #% I wish to record my absolute abhorrence of the war against Iraq , which is in breach of international law and natural justice . #% We have yet to see this document . #% So , while we welcome this excellent report today , and indeed commend the work of the Agency , we all need to be vigilant in our own countries to ensure that workers ' rights are upheld . #% Since that legislation came into being , there has been no noticeable difference . #% It was only last summer that the Israeli government and the Palestinian people were negotiating on what were bottom-line issues . #% I strongly urge EU governments and the European Commission to make available long-term financial assistance to help the Iranian Government with these difficult regeneration tasks . #% We fully support an immediate and generous response to the call by the UN for donors to contribute more than half a billion dollars in emergency aid , much of which has not materialised yet . #% Yet pursuant to a derogation under Article 15 of that directive , the United Kingdom Government is permitted to practise discrimination against Protestants in Northern Ireland who apply to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland , solely because they are Protestants . #% This single card will at least eliminate a lot of those difficulties . #% Any new conservation measures which are introduced at European Union level must be brought about in consultation with all interested parties involved in all Member States in order to protect what is a very valuable natural resource for all of us . #% It was also accepted that enlargement would not be achieved without some cost and that a contribution would be required from all Member States in proportion to their ability to contribute . #% My report also raises the issue of sub-prime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of sub-prime lending . #% However , to have a fighting chance in such a competitive business they need access to affordable patents and assistance with legal fees to protect and enforce their patents . #% However , as Chairman of the European Parliament Delegation to Canada , I fully recognise the importance that the Canadian Government attaches to its relationship with the 25 Member States of the European Union . #% The new regulations being proposed will be a significant step forward . #% On the one hand we are saying to governments that they must reduce their deficits and taxation , on the other they must increase spending in order to match European money . #% Failure to meet provisional targets -- and my own country , Ireland , is currently 16 % behind the target set -- is very unfortunate . #% Madam President , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here ! #% Genetic engineering makes it possible to achieve these aims more efficiently and in a much shorter time than by conventional propagation . #% Mr President , let me , at the outset say that our group is entirely in favour of Mr Pirker 's report . #% Mr President , one of the saddest things I have seen in recent times was Rosemary Nelson 's children following the hearse to the graveyard last month after this human-rights lawyer was brutally murdered in Northern Ireland . #% I can recall a time when this Committee on Budgetary Control was just a subcommittee of the Committee on Budgets . #% Not only are the interests of the patients afforded insufficient attention but also the carers of these patients are in many cases totally ignored . #% I favour a framework directive . #% For this reason , I can not support Amendment 57 , which I believe would threaten the chances of reaching a hard-won first reading agreement in the interests of all concerned . #% What do the people say ? #% 
It has been a first presidency for Sweden , and I believe both your government and state can feel a justifiable pride in a job well done . #% From my experience , the main problems stem from a lack of uniformity of laws under the two existing international conventions in this area , together with a lack of cooperation at intergovernmental level . #% On Monday night , as a member of that British Parliament , I voted a censure motion against Mr Douglas Hogg . #% I think not , Commissioner ! #% I would like to thank you for your various answers here tonight . #% I think the Fusion Programme has to be re-examined . #% I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency , which went out of its way to be helpful . #% In 2002 alone seizure of such goods doubled in the European Union . #% This , surely , is the bottom line in terms of the exclusion of citizens from society . #% We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place . #% We must commit ourselves not just to the concept of equality of opportunity , but equally and crucially to the attainment of equality of outcome . #% I welcome the operation of the Financial Services Action Plan . #% I therefore ask the Commission to look at the crux of this debate : how do we get good patent law which rewards our most innovative companies for their investment in R&D while , at the same time , not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant position , lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition ? #% As far as helping Russia itself is concerned , there can be no more financial aid without a genuine commitment to economic and political reform . #% -- Mr President , what we have heard here this morning is , regrettably , vintage McCreevy . #% I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament . #% The honourable Member will appreciate that ongoing discussions are taking place aimed at achieving a common position . #% Obviously the grieving families wish the bodies to be returned home , but in certain cases -- not necessarily those I have just mentioned -- they were simply unable to afford to repatriate the bodies of their loved ones . #% She has done some very good work . #% But we have to remember that we can not finance a meaningful regional policy for the new Europe out of the present budgetary resources . #% It completely flies in the face of conservation and sustainable fishing and there is no justification for it . #% We must act to make sure what is happening is stopped . #% Climate change is a serious global threat . #% The other , and more real , concern is that in an effort to achieve stability and an end to violence , strict and fundamentalist Islamic law will be enforced on large populations . #% While the current crisis is undoubtedly devastating , it also offers opportunity : opportunity to change our way of thinking ; opportunity to build a strengthening framework for sustainable growth that can withstand potential shocks ; and opportunity to build a sound economic and social base for the future . #% We have a duty to take real decisions on their behalf , not on the altar of any ideology but according to what we believe is in the best interests of the people of Europe . #% Mr President , the two Commissioners will know that while there is a crisis in the agriculture industry in Wales , Scotland and England , there is catastrophe in the north of Ireland . #% As friends , we should be allowed to ask questions . #% Madam President , unlike the last speaker I do not think this is an issue that should be trivialised in this way . #% Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work . #% Unfortunately I was unable to vote on this occasion due to the hospitalisation of my son . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank both Commissioners . #% That is very much the right approach . #% The European Commission identifies the weaknesses in this plan and says : This is the way we would like our money to be spent in addition to what you have already allocated for all this work you intend to do . #% I have just been informed that in the original text Mr Gallagher 's name was mentioned . #% We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets . #% Without equality there can be no equal opportunity and that has to be fundamental to our approach to this issue of women participating in decision-making . #% Clearly -- and he acknowledges this himself -- it is the Commission that is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law , including international agreements concluded by the Community and , therefore , the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement . #% However , Turkey entered into agreements with the European Union , under the Ankara Protocol , to do certain things . #% He is not allowed to leave the country , people watch him wherever he goes , he is not allowed to make contact with foreigners and he is not allowed to contact journalists . #% Mr President , the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely . #% One of the great advantages , however , of being a Member State of the European Union is having access to other Member States ' cooperation and knowledge base . #% I want to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with proposals which , in a spirit of solidarity , provide funding for those areas of the EU-15 -- including the UK -- that are still in need . #% We should understand the reasoning behind this approach . #% I was terribly shocked in my own country when I began to read in a serious Sunday newspaper recently an alleged transcript of a criminal and pornographic nature . #% It was as a direct result of the horror expressed in this Parliament at those dreadful crimes that we began on the path we are still moving along now towards improving legislation for the protection of children . #% That is not sufficient to ensure the animals ' welfare and the scientists have actually pointed this out . #% Too many diseases are included they say , when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis . #% Now today , while we concentrate our focus on human rights in Europe I would urge you to look at one section of our society in Europe for whom the situation is no better than anywhere else in the world : I am talking here about women . #% It is obvious to most people in this House that a race to the bottom in any area will not win the allegiance , or indeed build the confidence of European citizens in the European project . #% I would ask you as a very respected senior Vice-President of this House and present President-in-Office : would you have the security services remove from outside the doorway ? #% It is quite clear that the tactics of some people in this House were very sinister indeed : trying to put amendments in ; trying to get people who are health conscious to vote in favour of them . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report . #% We would actually like to see these things incorporated in a way that it would be vigorous and representative of a wider opinion . #% Mr President , the debate is just about over and the scientific jury is largely agreed on the impact of greenhouse gases on our climate . #% Of course we want to ensure by the year 2002 that the countries that suffered most when the common fisheries policy was put in place in 1983 will in future receive a fair and equitable share of the resources . #% The further transfer of this information to Parliament and its ` competent committee ? and ` in accordance with relevant procedures ? is vague . #% I would very much like to support this report . #% So what has gone wrong ? #% It is hypocrisy that Colombia gets trade advantages for workers ' rights when it has the world 's highest rate of murders of trade unionists and that EU officials in Zimbabwe are ignorant of key EU human rights guidelines . #% Iraq was given technology and weapons to pursue that war . #% The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis . #% According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas Parliament 's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years . #% If the broader international investor community is to have maximum confidence in economic and monetary union within the EU , the EU must put its house in order . #% That takes courage on both sides . #% Mr President , the sheer scale of the unprecedented flooding in China has prompted me to put down this motion for resolution expressing sympathy with the people and Government of China . #% 
Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey . #% The Commission proposal to now replace this sales ban with a mere test ban is totally unacceptable and of great concern in view of massive public demand to end the use of animal testing for cosmetics . #% A heavy price is being paid and I would wish to acknowledge the sacrifice of the American , British and other troops seeking to bring order to this strife-torn land . #% We talk about the two pillars of the CAP -- agriculture and rural development . #% And we weigh up the cost of a child against the cost of getting ahead or a social life or a car or a house or a vacation . #% It is actually our reckless abandon of the environment that has led to this dangerous changing of our climate . #% We must address this problem urgently . #% As the Committee on Legal Affairs has commented , the proposal should be considered as a point of departure rather than of arrival . #% I would like to be associated with Mr Whitehead 's remarks in relation to Mrs Kuhn . #% We can restore peace and confidence which was beginning to emerge . #% The European Union is extremely wrong in subsidizing something which shortens the lives of its users . #% Those who oppose these calls are acting in the interests of a tiny elite of wealthy individuals and corporations who make use of tax havens , and against the many who pay tax and rely on the services it pays for . #% A two-speed or a two-tier Europe will not succeed in meeting the aspirations of our peoples . #% This morning we are dealing only with the first , a proposal to improve the intervention access , changes to the various premium schemes and other changes in the beef sector . #% We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality . #% In conclusion , these are astonishing statistics which I am confident this Parliament will continue to work to reduce . #% Let us be sensible and adopt this sound and sensible proposal or we will risk a great divergence and indeed , discordance , in the Union . #% Will consumers lose confidence in our food ? #% We must have the courage of our convictions to defend those differences . #% We also have to look at the fact that in any kind of future measures against Iraq we should focus on the enhancement of human rights and democracy , and we should also look at the protection of the Kurds and in the north and the Shi'ites in the south in terms of guaranteeing them some sort of autonomy . #% As the previous speaker said , when we vote on the European Union budget in the future we should remember the common foreign and security aspect , because that is one area in which we are successful . #% Member States must commit 0.7 % of GNI to aid by 2015 , as promised , rather than decrease that share , which is doubly alarming in times of crisis , as GNI itself diminishes . #% We need to get the balance right with access to generic medicines and innovation and research and the needs of the pharmaceutical companies . #% The reason why the European Union displayed such strong unity and solidarity in the wake of 11 September is because we appreciated that contribution , and value the strong transatlantic alliance . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Madam President , can I thank both the Council and Commission for a very clear statement of their intent on this very crucial issue of rising food prices . #% Pirate fishing can be seen as a undesirable consequence of states at last attempting to improve the management of fisheries . #% We do not need the straw to break the camel 's back . #% We want to see it better resourced , both in the Commission and at Member State level , and we want to see SOLVIT as a trouble-shooter for citizens and consumers throughout the EU . #% Is it not the case that you will predetermine the national priorities of the Member States on where they wish to spend their structural fund money and state aid under Article 92 ( 3 ) ( c ) ? #% These courses were promoted by the local Leader group . #% I would like to point out to the President-in-Office that this target of 0.7 % was agreed 35 years ago and to date only five states , four of them EU states -- four out of 25 EU states -- have met this target of 0.7 % . #% You ask what more we can do . #% It is necessary therefore to get the balance right . #% The Bureau was set up some years ago on an initiative of the Irish government and is still co-financed by the Irish government . #% President Clinton ' s hypocrisy , which has already been highlighted today , is unacceptable . #% The central contact points will provide information and assistance with regard to the resolution of cross-border disputes within the European Union . #% Immediate implementation of the Roadmap is vital if one is to generate momentum for a peace settlement in the region . #% Countering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty . #% The `` European economic Recovery Plan '' put as priority areas the Lisbon strategy and energy ( with a special attention of energy efficiency in buildings ) . #% I would be grateful if I could have an answer to this supplementary . #% We have seen the destructive power of this rule recently when Britain , in a very misguided policy decision , held up most decisions for several months . #% Joint programming could be highly valuable in reducing fragmentation of the research effort , leading as it would to a pooling of a critical mass of skills , knowledge and financial resources . #% It is a long-established principle of EU law -- built up over many years of case law and underpinned by Article 230 ( 4 ) of the EC Treaty -- that citizens need to have a direct and individual concern in order to have a standing in the ECJ . #% In return we will support you as critical friends . #% As an Irish citizen , I find it hard to justify to my voters at home why I should be paying a different rate of tax to them or why I should be privileged to pay a lower tax . #% The fact is that uniformity is not necessarily unification . #% We must refuse to accept as legitimate any outcome of the national convention unless the conditions set down last year by the ASEM Ministers are met . #% Clearly Europe has a role to play in laying down and enforcing strict norms on water quality . #% The imprisoning of Gaza 's population behind walls and barbed wire fences must end immediately if a political and security disaster for the Palestinian people is to be averted . #% As a representative of the border region of Ireland I want to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur , Parliament , the various groups and the Commission for the consideration and sympathy that they have always shown with the problems in Northern Ireland . #% However , it should be up to each Member State to decide how this should be done . #% Lastly , no matter what anybody says , the financial perspective is the only game in town . #% We were told that the EEAS would be budget-neutral . #% Mr President , the United Nations evolved from various initiatives to bring the countries of the world together to promote true peace through the recognition of the dignity and worth of the human person and the value of the community -- local , national , and global -- in protecting the person . #% I ask you to consider the World AIDS Day tomorrow , 1 December . #% These are very serious allegations and I should also point out that similar allegations have been made as regards Somalia . #% It seems extraordinary to me that we do not want to follow the countries that are economically successful at the moment , but want to bring in a tax system that is unsuccessful in other parts of Europe . #% Mr President , Commissioner , can I first of all say I very much welcome this opportunity to follow the debate on this issue , but quite frankly I think it has tried our patience for a long time and most of us would like to see it resolved as soon as possible . #% You will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice . #% The Union should aim to minimize the bureaucratic and administrative burden placed on our industry , particularly by Union directives and regulations . #% There is clear and unequivocal scientific evidence that demonstrates the effect of climate change . #% The intergovernmental method of negotiating EU treaties where leaders wheel-and-deal behind closed doors on matters of importance for all our citizens has come to an end and is now also dead . #% Citizens are looking to us to make the right choice : to get rid of crippling protectionism in the single market in services and protect working and consumer rights . #% In voting through this report and its recommendations , this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism . #% I have some animal welfare concerns also , in particular developing validation of alternative methods for animal testing and hastening the replacement of animal-based toxicity testing with regard to chemicals policy . #% We must not , and can not , lose sight of this fact , but we must look at the bigger picture . #% 
Everybody interested in the issue should come along and listen to people outlining what they want . #% I do not find that to be an acceptable explanation . #% I thank the Commissioner for his statement . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , the discarding or dumping of fish in European waters destroys over a million tonnes of fish a year , particularly in multi-species fisheries . #% It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection . #% What is happening in East Timor as regards the aid workers is unacceptable . #% Ten years after Rio , expectations have not been met . #% But , likewise , the same mistakes that were made by governments at the start of the 20th century seem to be repeated today at the start of the 21st century . #% I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her work . #% These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders , or perhaps the victims , or the suicide bombers . #% It was a very comprehensive reply indeed , but one of the issues I have discovered , over almost thirty years of involvement in development , is the lack of emphasis on education . #% Unlike the political minefield that surrounds the reform of the UN Security Council , the UN has shown the capacity to agree on a new structure for dealing with human rights questions . #% Let us get right rather than get it early . #% Ireland has a particular interest , but so do the French , as do all of us in the 15 Member States and beyond . #% We must also ensure that in the European Union human dignity is protected and the weakest and most vulnerable are defended . #% We need to pay particular attention to our prisons . #% I therefore expect you , Mr President , to accord me the respect of the House and the answer to my question . #% Going forward , Parliament and the Commission must always keep an eye on how Member States are implementing this one . #% There is a deception I have to say being perpetrated on both the regions of Europe and the EU by some national governments , not least the government of my country , the United Kingdom . #% My group deplores the fact that this code of secrecy was slipped in during the Parliamentary summer recess , with no Parliamentary consultation and by written procedure . #% In this context , I should like to see more renewable energy used in public buildings in Brussels and other places in the European Union . #% Ireland should take the lead within the EU Council in demanding a more acceptable Agreement . #% We are all seeking to ensure that we put in place a Treaty which can govern the operation of the Union over the next 50 years . #% We must ensure that the EU responds urgently and effectively to potential crisis situations and thereby helps prevent the recurrence of the sort of tragedies that we have recently experienced in East Timor . #% The students taking part in these activities are not just increasing their own knowledge and abilities to deal with the ever-changing nature and shape of the world in which we live , they also represent the future building-blocks for a new society and a new understanding and tolerance of the cultural diversity within the European Union . #% Foreign policy hawks in the US Administration would do well to remember that the roots of current world crises relating to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden are a product of past dubious US foreign policy decisions . #% The attempt by the Council to shave EUR 275 million off market expenditure in such hard-hit sectors as arable crops , milk , beef and mutton and lamb is completely out of order under the current climate . #% I welcome the opportunity to work with you , President Barroso , and with your Commission to deliver on this programme . #% In Ireland alone , tourism revenue in 2004 amounted to EUR 5 billion and it accounted for 3.9 % of GNP . #% Our strategy was clear - more money for research . #% It is absolutely essential that Europe sticks to what it believes in and we believe in human rights . #% We should not abandon vast areas of our countries , where human activity will fade away . #% I am especially pleased that there is now growing international opposition to shipments of nuclear waste from Britain to Japan . #% I want to say to Mr Pinheiro that his contribution was very welcome . #% Taking into account the fact that we have appointed a committee , a sub-committee or an ad hoc committee to deal with this matter , I think it is very wrong that the outgoing President and Bureau should have their arms tied now and into the future as regards this most important subject . #% Since the EU relishes and promotes cross-border infrastructural projects within its own territory , would it not be incongruous and wrong for it to object to such a project in Israel , since improved communication links can only bring cohesion and social and economic betterment to those disparate territories ? #% This plan also proposes measures targeted at various consumer sectors which are designed to enhance energy awareness expertise and practice in areas such as appliance purchasing , use of energy in the home , building installations , heating systems , energy management in industry , the services sector and the public sector . #% We need a system where we get back what we spend , but this should not be tied in with a lot of other matters . #% If such exaggerated proposals were to be approved they would have a serious socio-economic impact with no health benefit . #% We have already heard about launchers and satellites . #% I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's assurances on codecision here today . #% It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved . #% The most important objective is to ensure that there is momentum on this issue . #% Parliament should call upon the United Nations Security Council to be convened , to take control of the situation and to mandate the Secretary-General to initiate steps to stop the war . #% As Rapporteur on EU ETS I am only too well aware of the critical role of research and the need to nurture the talent and minds available to solve the considerable climate challenges with which we are faced . #% As I address you , it is a great pleasure for all of us to move from the era of Paddy the Irishman to Paddy the President . #% Brazilian sugar barons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform , while 4 000 Irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant . #% in writing . - I strongly support this report . #% Both the fishing industry and the Committee on Fisheries claim that they agree with the need to conserve stocks and protect the marine environment . #% Childhood is not static . #% It is in the domestic sector where we need to find ways to encourage firms to supply not simply electricity or gas , but electricity or gas as a means to have cool or warm houses , fridges , the electricity that is needed . #% This prison state is , as far as we can tell , run in the worst Stalinist tradition , with starvation , terror and indoctrination . #% In most cases , ingredient listing by weight is sufficient to protect the interests of farmers and consumers and the formulations of the manufacturers . #% For example , statistics from Ireland - the country that myself and Mr Mitchell represent - reveal a significant increase in such cases , with 70 children abducted from the state last year , and I understand that 16 of these cases have yet to be resolved . #% This matter was signalled clearly at the Conference of Presidents last week - on more than one occasion , I understand . #% After intense public pressure he actually agreed to modify the plant 's design . #% For example , the Commission reprimanded the Irish Government a few years ago about the economic governance of our country , at a time when our economy was growing at 10 % per annum . #% In the meeting of the Conference of Presidents , all of the group leaders present made a very great effort to try to understand the precedents , to try to understand the complexity and to try to arrive at a reasoned and fair decision . #% One of the ways in which we can help to revive our economies is to ensure that the present deadlock in trade negotiations is broken . #% It is also vitally important that Member States should allow access for Community inspectors to their waters , allowing for a complete and more effective cooperation between national and European authorities . #% I hope Mrs de Palacio that you will state here today that you wish to see compliance in full with the recommendations and swiftly , because that is what I want to hear . #% I must also say - and , again , I disagree with my colleague - that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required . #% Mr President , first I should like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Presidentin-Office of the Italian presidency at a most difficult time , in fact at a time of European Union institutional crisis . #% We must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world . #% Unlike the Spanish and Italian governments , Irish citizens are not being selfish about the effects of enlargement on our future share of structural and cohesion funding . #% When we consider suicide , then we see that getting it right can even be a matter of life and death . #% 
Please take that as a given . #% There is already a need for EU legislation to make Member States take account of the need for the adequate separation of plants posing major hazards from population centres . #% Mr President , as I have already informed you , I would like to speak on a procedural matter , namely , why we should add another section to this report . #% . I have voted today against the Junker report which calls on the European Union and its Member states to integrate sexual and reproductive health and rights into their development policies . #% This is a challenge to the Council . #% Madam President , I shall start with the Kauppi report -- and I join in the congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son this week . #% It is therefore frightening that the Commission 's 1996 Annual Report concludes that there were irregularities to the tune of ECU 220 million in the EU 's system of preferential imports . #% It is our responsibility to ensure that it can not happen again . #% Peat power plants work very well indeed in my country and make an important contribution to Ireland ' s energy supply . #% In the overall context , securing peace in the Middle East is always going to take time . #% It would be most unfortunate if you should start in a procedure where you are legitimate in the context of a Commission as college - I speak not of individuals but of a college - which itself is discredited . #% As the stocks in EU waters which were the traditional target of EU vessels were becoming depleted , the result was the development of these new fisheries . #% The most recent and blatant example of this was the case of an airline company , Ryanair , where the management of that company refused to negotiate with the trade union SIPTU in relation to a group of young , very badly paid baggage handlers . #% Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita . #% I fully condemn the wholesale arrest of political opponents of the General , which include 3 000 peaceful protestors and civilian and human right activists . #% I can not speak for Greece or Portugal -- their own Members will do that -- but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries , although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough . #% So , too , the Commission has a case to answer . #% Only this week we hear of reports of outbreaks among the elk in the Colorado regions of the US and of new variant CJD outbreak among young men , young hunters - not the normal age group associated with CJD as we have over the years understood it to be . #% I do not think it is all simply down to enterprise . #% I fully support the right of the Palestinian population to self-determination and their right to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of the Israeli army and state forces . #% I look forward to a paper from the Commission with concrete proposals to give effect to many of the very useful ideas put forward in the proposed charter . #% In conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society . #% Without his strength and his vision we could never have arrived at where we are today . #% Of course , I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Green Paper on the review of the common fisheries policy , which is all important , particularly to my own country . #% In your response you relied heavily on the economic argument , but we have to say that both nuclear energy and coal are , in fact , heavily subsidised . #% Regional diversities must be recognized in all policy-making . #% It is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the Union of its red-tape image amongst the people of Europe . #% in writing . - I support this report , which calls on the Member States to ensure that people , at different times of life , have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally . #% It is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one . #% It is also vital that the directive be mandatory from 2008 so as to hold out a concrete , tangible target which will help to focus minds . #% Even with a gradualist approach to enlargement and long transitional periods which will reduce the overall cost , it will still be necessary to increase the size of the budget . #% While we strongly support measures to improve the situation of workers made redundant through the relocation of companies , we feel that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is not up to the task . #% Our farming and food production sector is facing great uncertainty at the moment and we must be vigilant in ensuring that any steps we propose serve to enhance the position of these crucial industries . #% It may be exciting to insiders , but outside , as he well knows , it is hardly mentioned in the newspapers . #% We have heard from all the petitioners of the disasters suffered by individuals . #% These are proliferating in my own country . #% When we take into consideration the fact that a lot of repressive legislation has been passed by the European Union in recent times without any public debate or any real participation by the citizens in the Member States , the very least we can do is ensure that the rights of people are protected . #% But if we are going to speak about the future of Europe , then that future has to be based on honesty , on facts . #% Secondly , I wish to place on record that , in respect of the reports which I have heard on the question of the oral submission , I find a number of points within that submission quite disturbing in terms of interpretation of the will of Parliament . #% I think her remarks addressed earlier to Mrs McNally were actually intended for me , but I am very happy to see that she is not symbolically sporting a headscarf in solidarity with Islamic fundamentalists . #% I wish to commend the work of my own group in the European Parliament who have inserted those principles of eradication of poverty into this revision . #% Too few people may be receiving too much money as the whole industry becomes restructured , and some very big producers get the compensation foreseen in the reorganised policy . #% Unelected diplomats should not be allowed to withdraw behind closed doors to dismantle the good work of the Convention . #% Those working in the service sector need the guarantee that their employment rights are protected . #% I hope those aspects of the report will be taken on board by the Commission . #% In this most sensitive and critically important area of Member State budgetary policy and Stage 3 of monetary union it is important , we believe , that it be placed firmly and belong institutionally at the heart of the first pillar . #% This whole enterprise can only come about by agreement . #% I think it is a very good outcome for us : Parliament has gained , insofar as we have maintained codecision under Article 179 , which is a very important principle to us . #% The officials acted or did not act as a result of the direct instructions of the commissioners responsible at that time and the then Council . #% Mr President , this year , for the second year in succession , the UN Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution calling on those states which still have the death penalty to impose a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty . #% The economic and environment benefits are obvious . #% Let us not hand out kudos to a company whose industrial relations practices are unjust and whose profits are built on the generosity of their employees . #% I would also briefly like to mention Mrs Harkin 's European Foundation report , which unfortunately is not being debated in the House , but is being voted on tomorrow as well . #% Mr President , the amendments to the main report - not the Euratom report - are not yet available . #% Also , all progress towards introduction of a CO2 tax has failed in Council . #% It is important -- indeed essential -- to determine the exact position in which we find ourselves at the earliest possible opportunity . #% Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union , together with Europol , must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken . #% Mr President , I wish to thank you personally for your efforts and assistance in trying to secure the release of my constituent from Liverpool , Ken Bigley , who was taken hostage in Iraq . #% To that end I wish to put on the official record that I intended no insult or aggression to any individual Member within this House and I wish to apologize unreservedly if my remarks were open to a different interpretation . #% These issues are exclusively for Member States . #% In summary , the European Parliament will support new energy and ecotaxes , but does not support more taxes . #% Mr President , the Irish fishermen both from the North and from the South whose home waters are those of the Irish sea are now staring in dismay at what is happening to their industry . #% We require a reorganization of the Commission 's personnel and a refocusing of policy . #% In particular I would like to reiterate the concerns of my fellow Irish citizens regarding the Sellafield-THORP plant . #% The one thing they all share is the necessity for solidarity between all peoples within the individual countries and across the European Union . #% It is incredibly important that the EU has participated in this process from the start and has played an active and constructive role in the drafting of the Agreement , as the fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy . #% 
Over the coming months we must approach these negotiations with firm determination so that an agreement can be secured on a text for the final Treaty , which hopefully would govern the operation of the Union for the next 50 years . #% The wording is now clearer in terms of many crucial aspects : the basic principle that human body parts , be they tissues or cells , must not be treated like some commercially tradable product . #% I believe that it is inappropriate to upgrade relations with Israel until such time as it displays concerted efforts to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian residents and engages in sustained political dialogue to reach a two-state solution to the region 's problems . #% However , my voting machine did not work and I wish to record my vote in favour of this report for the record . #% Finally , I wish that all Members of this House could come and see the difference this makes to grass roots communities . #% The more recent day-at-sea approach does not guarantee environmentally friendly fishing and bizarrely rewards the use of smaller mesh . #% We are also breaking new ground . #% We support their demand that all nuclear weapons should be taken off alert . #% The enlargement negotiations with the applicant countries will be entering a new phase during the Spanish Presidency . #% The proposals which do not provide for full compensation would have devastating effects on the Irish beef sector . #% Well , the donkey has various traits - one of which we know is stubbornness . #% Mr President , I do not agree with your interpretation of how we take the vote on the structural fund programme , because the general regulation is actually the regulation governing every other aspect of the implementing regulations . #% My third point , and I am sure it has already been made by my colleague , Georg Jarzembowski , is whether the Commission would respond positively to our repeated request for the establishment of a delegation office in Taiwan . #% I would like a response from the Commission in view of the opinion of the Advocate-General , delivered on 20 September last , on the preliminary ruling on the invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation ( EC ) No 925/99 on restricting the use of aircraft at European airports in the interests of protection against noise . #% So I could not support the overall report . #% Madam President , I would like to have talked in general terms but , given recent developments in my own country , I will confine my remarks to our future strategy . #% That is my main concern . #% However , as Mr Harrison has just pointed out , the government has responded by ordering all the elected members not already in jail or exiled to report twice a day to local authorities , basically to stop them convening on their own . #% I do not believe the Commission can , on the one hand , say we must open up access to the Irish Box and , on the other , preach conservation and protection of fish in other areas . #% If the House could agree we could overcome all the difficulties that we have with the language versions by putting in as a separate paragraph itself - either as a sub-paragraph of 45 or as a new 45 ( a ) - which says `` and urges them not to imprison young people who commit offences , except as a last resort '' . #% BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly . #% - It was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in Parliament today . #% To remain competitive , we must ensure that the benefits of new technologies are spread to all European regions . #% Who pressurised you ? #% It seems to me that the Spanish Government is to be congratulated in bringing about a situation in which a ceasefire has been announced . #% If a Member State , or a group of Member States , wishes to follow the best practices of another Member State , then so be it . #% Mr President , I should like to join in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work . #% In my own constituency in Dublin only this weekend I have seen a family who have lost two young women during the last year as a result of drug abuse . #% The Irish people are a generous people . #% We should not be afraid of offending our EU partners by condemning their cooperation with tyranny . #% We need to begin to audit these policies to make sure we are in line with our own objectives within the Treaty . #% in writing . - There are many issues in this resolution which I support . #% Even low levels of exposure to radiation could be poisoning the human gene pool , wreaking damage on future generations . #% I believe the decision that was arrived at at the Conference of Presidents reflected a consensus view , which was a collective wisdom , and you have enunciated that view here today . #% Goods do flow freely from these territories , goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories . #% Mr President , I too would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur , and to the draftsman from the Committee on Legal Affairs , with regard to the proposal put before us . #% People should have the right to opt for a healthy approach , rather than waiting for disease to set in and then having to resort to pharmaceutical drugs , many of which have dangerous side effects . #% It is our responsibility to provide them with the information to make this choice . #% There were many reasons for this , but an overriding one was that our government took its citizens for granted . #% I welcome the attempts , in very difficult circumstances , by both governments to restore the peace process . #% This could be best achieved by first ensuring that the interests and concerns of the citizens of each of our countries are made known at the highest level in the Commission . #% Equally , promoting market economies in Eastern and Central Europe is good news for businesses within the Union , which can also expand their goods and services into new markets . #% I urge the Irish Government to enable the survivors to remain in Ireland , to help them rebuild their lives , and to provide them with refugee status if that is appropriate . #% Co-operation and co-ordination is the key . #% Mr President , these reports deal with very important issues , and I compliment both rapporteurs . #% 1.8 million people died in 2002 from tuberculosis alone ; 2.2 billion are at risk of malaria , which is preventable and curable provided that sufficient ACT or the new combination therapy is made available ; 39.4 million people are living with the HIV virus , and last year alone 3.1 million died from AIDS , mainly in sub-Saharan Africa . #% We need people who have been disenfranchised in the areas of science and technology - women , older people and particularly those suffering disadvantage - to be on board in the quest for this wider knowledge . #% Otherwise , we would be in a very serious situation , particularly if , as is proposed , the United States provides aid to their airlines . #% If not , would you give an undertaking to look at it ? #% When Member States signed up to the Edinburgh Agreement , they knew the commitments they were entering into ; they knew they had to meet the convergence criteria and it is simply not good enough now to make a linkage which is not in the interests of our regional policy programmes . #% These people are taken into prison without proper documentation or proper charges being made . #% In the light of the fact that the Dounreay nuclear plant is now being closed because of the public health risks to the operations being carried out there , the Irish Sea must not be used as a dumping ground for nuclear waste materials from the Sellafield plant . #% In a review of the water fluoridation policy by the Irish Government a few years ago , 90 % of the public submissions called for an end to this mass-medication . #% It is something I feel strongly about but I can not say there is one view within the Council on this matter . #% That is not efficient , and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic à la Lisbon Declaration . #% Sudan requires a political solution very fast . #% We must ensure that we not only pay lip service to the disabled this year , but also give particular emphasis to those who can not speak for themselves , and mostly that means the elderly disabled . #% It is a very relevant debate . #% In conclusion , I would make a general comment about the contribution of the EU to improving environmental awareness and protection . #% We want one inspection of every farm ; that should be enough anywhere to inspect . #% No subject has been spoken about more often in this Parliament by those who are talking for the unemployed of Europe than this particular issue . #% Let me say very clearly that the disconnect between agriculture and food is part of the problem that we are debating here today . #% That is why I voted against this budget . #% You have spoken out clearly on our behalf when clear statements were needed on the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights . #% With such a model , the quality of the test can be very high , which makes it very difficult and very expensive for young people to get , and yet no one looks at the skills of a driver 20 years on . #% The bottom line is that , if the common position on the dual legal base is maintained , this regulation will end up with a single Article 175 legal base after the ECJ has examined it and struck down the subordinate legal base , Article 95 . #% 
It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU . #% There are however , particularly in Ireland , a substantial number of borrowers on fixed rates , sometimes at interest which is three times higher than the current rates and which lending institutions are unwilling to adjust without substantial financial penalties . #% There were occasions in the past when farmers were found to be in breach of food regulations and deservedly condemned . #% However , this does not preclude the Member States from identifying those areas where there are difficulties in cooperation between Member States and finding ways to improve such cooperation . #% It ought to be extremely rare for two or more cases of severe injuries to occur in a single accident . #% It is , however , the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council 's delaying tactics . #% What is happening in terms of Commission proposals on different legal bases and the Council subsequently changing or amending them or , in many cases , introducing a dual legal base ? #% There have been noticeable losses to countries like Mauritius , which now run the risk of being relegated to the category of poorest countries . #% During this extension of PEACE Funding I am looking for an overt righting of these wrongs . #% In addition , condemnation of terrorism rings hollow when they fail to take a strong line against the incidences of state terrorism committed by Israel , which have the potential to create future generations of terrorists in that region . #% Those are the three principles we have in our peace process in Northern Ireland . #% I too have met some of these people . #% We think this is a very good starting point , but it should not end there . #% I think that what we really have to do is show courage now in laying down clear standards and guidelines of what we expect from our partners with regard to their relationships . #% It is now vital that the EU establish a framework for customs services effectively functioning as if they were one . #% Also , from a health perspective , this scheme would protect people from potentially carcinogenic , mutagenic , reprotoxic or biocumulative products which can sometimes be traced in textiles . #% A serious abuse of European law and the Statute of the European Investment Bank is taking place in my own country . #% I am sure that Ayatollah Khamenei will reverse the decision -- as it should be -- in favour of those who are trying to bring peace and reform to Iran . #% The LRA is only a small force , but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants . #% The report also deals with many individual countries . #% I fully support this EP report 's call to compensate farmers for their efforts in reducing emissions and to provide support in adapting to climate mitigation measures . #% Reference intake values are the accepted scientific norm today and should be used to ensure that labelling is clear , unambiguous and meaningful ; they would greatly facilitate consumer choice , not least as a tool to fight obesity . #% I would like , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , to place a somewhat greater emphasis on the urgency of achieving as early as possible an enlargement towards the east . #% I am proud to wear the white ribbon to show that I make that stand myself personally . #% In terms of the cohesion report , I would like to point to the need for an ongoing evaluation of how other Community policies are supporting the objective of economic and social cohesion . #% I would suggest that it might result in even less financial support to the industry , and markets would not improve . #% However , Mr Barroso rightly has not rolled over and died in front of the onslaught that has taken place , over the last week in particular . #% Energy saving and the rational use of energy must be part of our strategy for security of supply . #% I take note of that fact that as he talked about Europe 's profile in the world he referred to enlargement and mentioned that enlargement will move the epicentre of the European Union towards the east . #% While I fully endorse giving priority to setting up units to provide palliative care for the terminally ill , so that they can die with dignity , I believe that the sensitive question of euthanasia is not one that should be dealt with by the European Parliament . #% I do not understand the political interference and the real message from France , and we should get to the bottom of it . #% As we speak in this House , four - five - and six-year-old children in a small area of Belfast in Northern Ireland are being terrorised by so-called protests . #% In the Commission 's revised proposal , diplomatically referred to as the Council 's compromise - the one we are not being consulted on - the biologically sensitive nature of the Irish Box is back . #% Surely it is far from natural justice to refuse to take action now and to continue as if the future is bright , only to have more and more stocks decrease and to impose even further temporary or permanent closures . #% The proposals on lifelong learning are an emerging response to this deficit , but only an emerging one . #% Regulation is necessary both economically and socially . #% Commissioner Solbes Mira 's reprimand angered middle Ireland and raised fears of Europe meddling in our tax affairs . #% Nuclear accidents do not respect borders and no Member State can act on its own . #% For the record , Raytheon , a high-tech software plant to which the amendments are directed , is to be funded by the IDB , the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland , not the IFI . #% Let people in , not these trophies . #% Mr President , I really welcome this opportunity to speak . #% We should eventually take this approach to everything . #% This directive , as a piece of intellectual property legislation , must try to incorporate structures to reward the creative industries , which in my own Member State alone contribute GBP 60 billion to our national economy and GBP 8 billion of exports . #% What they see is a penny-pinching attitude , driven by an accountancy approach to politics , rather than the statecraft our citizens are crying out for . #% However , the Doha Round can not simply be about what the EU is willing to concede on agriculture . #% We can only begin to imagine the effect of any kind of nuclear scare - just a scare - on these sectors of our economy . #% Hence the country-of-origin principle , particularly in its original form in the proposed directive , is for me a bridge too far : it would be injurious to home-grown employment to permit service providers to operate in the host country of their choice without , unlike local providers , being subject to the same costly restraints in labour , consumer and environmental legislation . #% Neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , our resolutions on this issue address the dual challenges of eradicating hunger - which currently affects one sixth of the world 's population - and securing a food supply for the future . #% I speak from my own limited experience in that area , which I shall relate at another time and in another place . #% Why is the list of reviewers not published ? #% In fact , the pattern of harassment of human rights activists and opposition figures and church personnel has reached alarming levels . #% The highest priority for you now is to begin to give operational content and meaning to both the non-military and military challenges of Petersberg , not least , given the several hats you wear , particularly the military ones . #% The issue of most widespread concern at the present time is crime . #% Presenting us with your vision of the future is all very well , but actually making it work for the people of Europe is the real challenge . #% If we are serious about trying to encourage firms in the right direction then we have to encourage the best available technology . #% This is a first step in ensuring that countries in Northern Europe , such as the UK and Ireland , are not discriminated against in the framework of a new classification system . #% Mr President , on the question of Sellafield and the contamination of the Irish Sea , I did not say that the article was edited , but completely excised , at the request , I believe of the nuclear industry , specifically British Nuclear Fuels Limited . #% Finally , the European Commission should allocate greater financial resources to investigating the causes of , and possible cures for , Alzheimer 's disease . #% We now have a crisis in agriculture particularly and that crisis needs to be addressed . #% We are not going to find a way forward without sanctions , because we need both the carrot and stick approaches to ensure that the legislation is complied with . #% Is he willing to bring this concern to the attention of the Council with a view to encouraging the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels to cease operations at Sellafield and , in particular , to stop the reprocessing of nuclear waste ? #% We do not have a great deal of time . #% In an enlarged Europe of 25 -- soon to be 27 -- Member States , the Council may well resort to more frequent use of a dual legal base in order to try and satisfy various national interests . #% Some have argued that it is not reasonable to try and change a programme in the last year or that certain aspects of the proposal are contrary to the idea of natural justice . #% Reports and contributions to this debate remind us that some of our worst fears are justified . #% 
Between 1983 and 1993 25 regions with the lowest unemployment rate managed to improve from 4.8 % to 4.6 % but the picture for the 25 worst regions was more devastating with an increase of 17.2 % to 22.4 % . #% I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Jöns , my own Group , Commissioner Špidla and the Council for largely agreeing the amendments which Parliament put forward and which the Commission fought hard for . #% There needs to be a change in the attitude of the current US Administration if the transatlantic relationship is indeed to be restored . #% Mr President , like previous speakers I , too , am gravely concerned that since last December the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated to a new low . #% It must be emphasised very strongly that , insofar as this Research Fund has any impact , it must be on safety at work . #% Having consulted with nutrition experts from the University of Ghent and from Trinity College Dublin , I am convinced that the concept is not grounded in solid science and will have the adverse effect of depriving consumers of a great deal of information . #% The fact that it now has attracted a democratic mandate does not alter or dilute its terrorist persona . #% The scenes in Dublin were more reminiscent of other countries , where there are greater extremes of climate . #% So , in that context , the phrase ` pensions time bomb ' is certainly accurate . #% Sometimes we seem to forget that we are dealing with the discharge in respect of 1998 . #% There will be a ban on enforced sales , that is , the distant supply of unsolicited services . #% The compositional quality and indeed the bacteriological quality of foods are more accurately measured today than ever before . #% Mr President , I am from a country with a constitution that enshrines the truth about fundamental human rights : the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity ; the truth that a supreme being , not a mere human institution , gave these rights to us -- all of us without exception . #% Mr President , the Nitrates Directive deals expressly with nitrates in groundwater . #% Unfortunately , in the United Nations yesterday , the United States vetoed the United Nations mandate for Sfor in Bosnia , in which many EU countries are participating . #% Finally , there was the unresolved question as to whether the Member States that already have more ambitious legislation in force -- notably Austria and Denmark -- would be allowed to keep those measures , or whether the EU would force them to lower their environmental standards in an area of combating climate change at a time when there are already difficulties in meeting Kyoto targets to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases . #% A study carried out in Ireland recently came out with the fact that the impact of EMU on tourism , retailing , agriculture , manufacturing industry and financial services was excellent . #% The Chinese regime is increasing its repression , and that repression has increased since the Chinese Stalinists decided to go for the capitalist market as a means of developing the economy . #% We are mad . #% The idea of protection for those who are most vulnerable within our society is at the very core of what the European social model should be about . #% Members should remember this when we are voting on the budget this year for the Cork Declaration to ensure we can encourage industry and people to come back to rural areas . #% My constituent goes on to say that it is not just a cross-border issue , but a European one . #% I accept , of course , that rises in prices and labour prices and labour costs can impact on inflation , but clearly in our Member State economies , where increasingly wage rates are negotiated through national agreements and are linked to productivity , and have all kinds of other factors built into any increases that employees get , the likelihood of labour costs being the driving force behind inflation to my mind is untrue . #% Up to 800 000 women are victims of trafficking every year , 100 000 of them in the European Union . #% The European Union has taken a great stride towards political as well as economic integration today . #% I would just like to mention my concerns about my own country . #% A very important part of my question concerns the continuity of LEADER . #% There is an awful lot to be said for this report . #% For example , we all recall the introduction of decimalisation and , despite our assurances at that time , consumers experienced price increases . #% Our hospitals and our health services are staffed by health workers from India , the Philippines , South Africa and many other countries . #% I should like to know what positive or proactive action is being taken by the presidency to ensure that not only the existing Member States within the EU , but also those countries with associate membership numbering 27 in total , which could help bring us up above the 60 countries required for formal ratification and the enforcement of this International Criminal Court , actually ratify . #% We need some radical thinking and radical action . #% We need to employ a flexible system , and the subsidies we pay will go up and down . #% In some ways , as we enter , in terms of direct mandates , our twenty-first year we have now achieved this new age of maturity . #% I have some doubts about the capability of the European Commission to have the resources and rigour which our citizens demand . #% As long as I have been here in Parliament we have observed the awful dangers that many children in the world live in : a litany of miseries which are listed in this resolution here today . #% The vast majority of them are believed to have been involved in entirely peaceful activities . #% It is crazy , and he deserves far better . #% Secondly , CO2 technology is not suitable for use in certain extreme temperatures , in very hot climates for instance . #% Another leitmotif of the Fifth Framework Programme has to be sustainable development . #% If BNFL is successful with this application , while it will result in halving the levels of technetium 99 that are dumped in the Irish Sea , this will still be 15 times higher than the levels which existed in 1992 . #% Let me finally say that I believe that the Commission has an inconsistency in policy . #% While flooding has always been a fact of life in Ireland , its increasing frequency and severity is another real reminder of the effects of climate change caused by the reckless abuse of our environment . #% We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied , to a certain extent , to the kind of things that we can achieve . #% We simply state what our conditions are and what is necessary in order to begin talks under the quartet based on Oslo . #% Mr President , the whole principle of fingerprinting asylum-seekers , as far as I am concerned , is intolerable . #% It is about reducing the number of competitors and letting the large corporations loose to do their best . #% In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria , against which the Commission has been considering legal action , a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31 December 2012 . #% You have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat . #% I congratulate Mr Pronk on his proposals with regard to the very technical aspect of providing venture capital to these small enterprises , so that Europe once again can be in the lead in creating new employment . #% While Member States control key instruments such as national budgets , pension and healthcare services , the EU can further the reach of anti-discrimination legislation , particularly to protect older women in the labour market . #% Some would say that the vast majority do , and if that were the case , then we would not need to legislate . #% I would like to reassure Members that we are doing our very best to take action in this regard . #% That is not my vision for Europe . #% The other thing I would like to point out is that there are companies , such as British Nuclear Fuels , who have absolutely no sense of public responsibility or environmental awareness . #% I should like to thank my colleagues , particularly Mrs Fourtou , Mr Oreja , Mr Manders and Mrs Echerer , for supporting this initiative for a written declaration . #% Similar possibilities apply to animals . #% I therefore call on all employers to be consistent in their approach to social dialogue and to take a positive view of the new directive . #% One of the most important factors when we look at the creation of new offices or new institutions under the European Treaties is that there are a number of elements that have to be remembered first and foremost . #% We must never lose hope . #% Hopefully the achievement of gender mainstreaming , at least in this programme , will ensure that gender mainstreaming is part of all policies developed by the European Union and the Member States . #% The committee 's foundation comes only a few days after a train carrying spent nuclear fuel flasks derailed as it arrived at the Torness power plant in Scotland . #% We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland -- to the great relief of all of us . #% For example , the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission . #% We have the Member States going one way , we have the Commission going another way , we have scientists telling us another thing and in the middle we have fishermen and the fishing industry wondering what way they can go . #% Why not legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources , for example 5 % bio-ethanol mix in petrol , 2 % bio-diesel mix in diesel vehicles , without any alteration necessary to the vehicles ? #% 
Here I welcome the amendment on orphan waste products . #% To pretend GM food contaminant can be labelled organic is so ludicrous that we have to ask why this possibility is allowed for in this directive . #% While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems , we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins . #% Mr President , most people think that the situation in Iran has changed slightly in recent times but it is still very much the same . #% So my question is : will this agenda for new jobs and growth not apply to Ireland or Greece or , indeed , any country that is implementing these severe austerity measures ? #% It was the vigilance of this Parliament in particular that raised a warning flag in relation to many aspects of the application of this research . #% However I asked a slightly different question and I think it might still be possible for it to be answered . #% We have not reached any conclusions yet , but one thing we have established is that the regulators were playing games of ping-pong with policyholders . #% But , also , when we speak about harmonisation of taxation or harmonisation of the minimum wage , this obviously militates against creating equality , because countries that at present have lower wages and a high level of social protection could be made uncompetitive , with business and companies being attracted elsewhere and jobs lost . #% I would like to indicate my total opposition to the proposals in Agenda 2000 relating to the reform of the CAP . #% The Commission proposes an extension of the excise tax regime on hydrocarbons to a much more comprehensive tax base , including sectors that have heretofore been excluded in some or all of the Member States - sectors such as coal , gas , electricity and home-heating oil . #% I totally support this Joint Motion . #% But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised , in Germany they have not , yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands . #% This should be reduced gradually . #% The Greens are not against fishing or trying to close down fisheries to protect some species . #% It is a useful tool , but it is a relatively modest proposal ; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model . #% We are opposed to any other countries joining the nuclear club or the extension of the nuclear abilities of those powers already armed with nuclear weapons . #% We urgently need to focus on economic reform , especially in countries with unacceptably high unemployment and abysmal growth rates , in order to deliver on the Lisbon promises and not just come out with the same old Lisbon rhetoric . #% Therefore , road safety matters are dealt with adequately under that directive , and , if anybody believes that they are not , then we need to look at the Driving Time Directive . #% We would like to check that there is to be a separate vote on Amendments Nos 38 and 39 as a block and on Amendments Nos 80 , 102 , 122 , 127 and 128 . #% Ireland 's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration . #% In relation to CMR substances , which are allowed in cosmetics , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy reaffirmed its first reading request to ban CMRs in cosmetics unless evaluated and accepted as safe by the Scientific Committee . #% These concerns should be comprehensively addressed in 1997 because there will not be any single currency unless it has popular support in all of those countries whose governments now aspire to join the euro-zone from day one . #% Finally , with the Internet now being presented to us , we must ensure that this resource is tapped for the greater good not for exclusivity . #% It is regrettable that some Member States are now advocating a reduction in the size of the EU budget . #% I call on the Commission to immediately initiate an examination of all activities on the Cumbria site and ask the Commissioner to give assurance to that effect in his reply . #% Mr President , the cavalier attitude the Israeli authorities display towards their obligations to comply with international law with regard to their trade relations with European Union is an indicative example of its attitude to international law in general . #% It says that we should encourage cooperation in the attainment of environmental objections and have particular regard to improving energy efficiency . #% Closer coordination between the Commission and Member States is needed and Parliament therefore supports the development of joint strategy papers . #% Of course , Iceland , as a member of the EEA , has had a major advantage in that they have already adopted a significant part of the acquis . #% Did you actually read our report ? #% I warmly welcome the outgoing President-in-Office of the Council and his European Affairs Minister Gay Mitchell on their formal visit to the European Parliament to bring to a conclusion Ireland 's presidency of the Union . #% I refer , for example , to the Commission 's programme for rural development or accompanying measures under the common agricultural policy . #% Codecision is not negotiable . #% Mr President , listening to the debate this morning you would imagine that , not only is there a European crisis , but that Europe does not have any answers or responses to the will and the wishes of the people . #% It is disgraceful for instance that they are meanstested for the carers allowance . #% When that threat moves closer and they must escape , we must receive them . #% At the end of the day whether it is realpolitik or empiricism that brings us to this conclusion , my group would appeal that each Member State would reflect on its own position and where possible would opt out from this particular policy . #% This should be done far more frequently in a whole range of Community policy areas , because there are some Member States that take advantage of the markets created by those Member States that do transpose , while not playing fair themselves . #% When I met the leaders of the milk industry -- the representatives of the farmers who produce milk in Northern Ireland -- I was somewhat disturbed to find that the reduction by the European Union of the export refunds on milk powder , as well as other export refunds , has driven the price received by the farmers in my region to an all-time low . #% There will be peace on the island of Ireland if peace can be established between those two communities . #% While beef producers need all the support they are getting , given their present difficulties , it is not in their interest either to have competition generated between dry stock sectors by imbalance in the respective regimes . #% Israel must be persuaded by Europe that frustrating the economic development of Gaza is counterproductive for Israel 's own security ; it should also , in my view , be counterproductive for Israel 's trade relations with Europe . #% Improvements to car standards and cleaner fuels are a necessity . #% Some of the landfill sites that are being closed down pose major problems , so it is essential that these sites also come under the directive . #% It is particularly important in the medical field where there are serious health and safety issues should patients be unable to communicate with the doctor in their own language . #% What has happened to the goals and the timetables that were clearly set out ? #% What about the method of disposal - have we reached any scientific conclusions about the necessity for incineration as against the safe burial of dead animals ? #% Despite the complexity of the problem let us keep in mind the whole time what we want at the end . #% In addition their failure to support a stronger role for local and regional governments in the management of European funding is a blow to democracy and partnership . #% Given that this is the European headquarters of the European Parliament one would have thought that every mechanism would be in place to ensure that Members get here . #% I thank the Commissioner for her very comprehensive and most informative reply . #% These are their channels and their programmes and they have the ownership of this community-building peace programme . #% While the agricultural sector needs to be competitive and must change to take account of varying circumstances such as EU enlargement and world trading conditions , it is important to adequately compensate farmers for the price reductions this will entail . #% It is time to banish the notion that the future of climate change policy is coterminous with the Kyoto Protocol . #% I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention . #% I am particularly pleased that the presidency succeeded in putting sustainable development at the core of European politics . #% It is important that the information campaigns , which are to be intensified later this summer , are successfully managed . #% The first relates to institutional reform and the second to policy matters . #% When the Burmese Prime-Minister-in-exile visited Dublin recently he expressed fears that the European Union would ease its pressure on the generals in power for trade reasons . #% I have been indicating for quite some time - well before many people who have already spoken - that I want to make a point of order . #% I ask the President-in-Office to try once more , otherwise we will have to ask the UN and the Americans to help us out . #% It is important that the European Parliament and the Commission are seen to be serving the public of Europe . #% It has been very interesting to hear so much consensus this morning . #% My colleague has already mentioned this . #% Any suggestion of renationalising spending within the common agricultural policy would also work to undermine the fabric of the CAP , which would fly in the face of the interests of European farmers and rural regions . #% 
Beijing does not publish any information about arms transfers abroad and has not submitted any data to the UN Register on Conventional Arms in the last eight years . #% My own group has tabled a number of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage . #% The Irish government has stated its intention to hold a referendum on 31 May 2001 to ratify the International Criminal Court and to alter our constitution for that . #% We are harmonising the legal systems , whether for better or worse , without proper public debate , without public accountability . #% In particular , in Mr Hernández Mollar 's report one sees the basis for employment creation and , most importantly of all , employment retention - looking at ways of maintaining jobs as well as creating new ones . #% When we create wealth we can distribute it , but we must create it first and we must encourage those people who can create it . #% It is a multilateral solution which enlists a reputable and widely trusted agency , the World Health Organisation . #% Perhaps that explains why our government did so little , took the electorate for granted and was content to mine the Eurosceptic vote for the forthcoming general election , with several ministers in recent months giving very ambivalent signals . #% As Mr Stevenson has said , they are going to suffer endless hardship . #% We seem to be able to get weapons there for the Eritreans and Ethiopians to continue the war of aggression against each other over nonsensical issues and , at the same time , while the European Union and the Western World export weapons to Ethiopia and to Eritrea , the famine continues and the lives of millions and millions of people are threatened . #% As the rapporteur for Hong Kong , there are a number of issues about which I have concerns but I feel it is inappropriate to raise those concerns now . #% It prescribes a very rigid regime of farming by dates : not exactly as nature intended . #% It is important to realise that the Bathing Water Directive should be considered in that wider context . #% There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations . #% Lord Inglewood of BNFL recently indicated that he would certainly take on board the concerns I expressed to him on this subject , in the same way that the concerns of the Austrians in relation to Temelin have been structured by the Commission . #% So if we can save a child 's life , until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question , we will have to allow controlled use . #% This report would update and strengthen existing measures for combating these abhorrent behaviours , and define them as criminal offences , punishable by law . #% We were there when he was sentenced to prison for a further 11 years . #% A simplified single Treaty will make the EU of 25 more intelligible to the citizens of Europe by defining the EU and Member States ' competences clearly . #% We are trying to balance flexibility with security for workers who , in many countries , still do not have any security at all . #% Climate-proofing and adaptation need to be mainstreamed across policy areas , especially those concerning water , soil , agriculture and fisheries , and coastal areas . #% in writing . - As a representative from a region , Northern Ireland , where Sinn Fein , affiliates of a terrorist organisation which recently murdered a young man , Paul Quinn , has been admitted to government in a coalition with exclusively democratic parties , I was encouraged to note and vote for Amendment 14 which was in the following terms : #% These leaders should remember that it is very hard to justify to European taxpayers the very substantial levels of financial assistance Kosovo is receiving from the Union if its leaders fail to condemn the violence which is taking place in the region at this time . #% We have to look for change . #% The system is certainly very necessary , if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards . #% I appreciate not only his efforts in helping to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference but his long-standing interest in European affairs and his long-term efforts to promote the integration and the union of Europe . #% Others , such as the management at Sellafield , who deliberately conceal information and involve themselves in bad practices , be held accountable for their deeds . #% As indicated this morning by Dick Spring , the President-in-Office of the Council , maintaining the momentum towards Economic and Monetary Union is one of the main priorities of the Irish presidency . #% Again , we have conflict , contradiction and dual standards . #% Was the Member who replaced Mr Casini indeed entitled to vote , as Mr Casini ' s resignation was only announced on Monday evening . #% This must be avoided if the European sector is to meet the challenge of quality and competitiveness in the future . #% At the same time , of course , we believe that terrorism should be fought in all ways . #% In particular , the areas that we are talking about in this present raft of recognition of qualifications , are areas where we have experienced huge shortages within the EU in the recent past . #% The NGOs know where they are and there is no reason why we should not have the information . #% I also think that there is a lot of hypocrisy and double-speak in this House . #% Irish Rail needs major investment and modernization . #% Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known . #% We want to ensure that the mistakes that were made then are not made again . #% This report is a restatement that Europe 's core values of equality , solidarity , redistribution and anti-discrimination , care for the young , the old and the sick through universal public provision must be defended in the necessary reforms already under way ; that our social model is not an obstacle to competitiveness and growth but is , in fact , a necessary ingredient if we are to deliver the kind of decent European society that our citizens clearly desire ; and that the concept of ` flexicurity ' , pioneered by my colleague Mr Rasmussen in Denmark , can help facilitate reforms by preventing people from tumbling into poverty as a result and can , if properly tailored to each Member State 's needs , be an important tool in the process . #% My group would like to extend its sympathy to the citizens of Göteborg on a very difficult moment in a wonderful host city . #% He should not be given refuge in the European Union under any circumstances . #% Another positive development is Edmond Ho Hau-Wah 's stated intention of breaking up the casino monopoly and aiming to create an Asian equivalent of Atlantic City . #% Legislation coming from Europe has a massive impact on the lives of those living within its borders and we must use every opportunity to ensure this legislation is as fair and balanced as possible . #% It is very much in the interests of smokers to know exactly what chemicals are contained in tobacco products and for them to be able to exercise informed choice . #% In recent days , Madam President , we have been disturbed to read reports that suggest that Denmark may delay the adoption of this legislation on the grounds of a challenge on the legal base . #% The debate on the IGC and treaty reform should be characterised by caution and by mature reflection . #% Mr President , US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran . #% I believe that each Member State should retain the right to nominate one member of the Commission or , at a minimum , ensure that there is an equality of representation on the Commission from both small and large states . #% The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions . #% It is a despicable repeat of the most heinous crimes committed during previous conflicts this decade in Yugoslavia . #% The outgoing Commission resigned last March and since I can hardly explain to myself why the rump part of that Commission is still there , how can we expect the citizens of Europe to understand that fact ? #% We must not repeat this mistake . #% The only thing they can gain from a soft monetary policy , devaluing their currency in order to gain competitiveness , is to reduce the wages of their own people and create greater poverty for the low paid . #% I would be pleased to hear whether you accept that we ought to drop the push for investment to be included . #% Can any of us imagine what it would be like to lose a loved one because of a so-called political cause ? #% The only way we are going to get some sort of equality for women is when women actually occupy the key decision-making roles . #% Parallel to the endorsement of the Amsterdam Treaty , the European Council has also launched two individual programmes to combat organised crime aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and establishing more efficient judicial co-operation . #% For this reason , staff concerned with the transport of animals must be fully trained to ensure a high level of care at all times . #% Finally , a plea for the whisky industry : what is the transition situation ? #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Jöns for her report which draws attention to the nature of the work contract between employees in part-time work and their employers and the many ways in which discrimination against these workers occurs . #% Mr President , I come to this debate today with a lot of reservations because of some of the comments made by other speakers in a previous debate . #% Amendment No 28 by the PSE Group , the Verts/ALE Group and the GUE/NGL Group and others can not be misinterpreted : '' ... users who produce , acquire and/or possess drugs for personal use and users who supply drugs to others without the intention of making a profit are excluded from the scope of this framework decision . '' #% Well , in discussing the budget , it is important to note the important role that the European Union and the European Parliament have played in this peace process through the International Fund for Ireland , the establishment of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund , INTERREG and the removal , through the Single Act , of the economic border which affected the border region for many years . #% My second point concerns the resolution itself , which contained a call for new elections . #% Why should they face an anti-social life ? #% They look to us to provide and guarantee safety and to ensure that employed and self-employed drivers are protected by the law from being driven into bad health and , perhaps , an early death from overwork . #% 
If we believe , as I do , that the European agricultural model must be multifunctional and sustainable , equally it must be commercially viable and competitive . #% This conciliation process must reach an effective agreement . #% People can understand that and to some extent they can control the rate they pay by their choice of car . #% If this committee is to work properly it is vital that it gets the time to do the job correctly . #% Despite the hard line of the Council , which is shared by the Commission - something I regret because it is not its constitutional position to do so - Parliament insists on its position . #% We are giving money to banks , but banks do not assess people on their track record , on their character and on the knowledge of their business . #% But it is strange that many companies in Ireland which do not negotiate with trade unions representing their own workers at local level do not seem to have great difficulty dealing with unions at the national or European levels . #% However , I recognize that we have serious ethical considerations in this directive . #% As I said , the presidency and the Council 's concern is with cooperation and the protection of the external frontiers of the European Union . #% The reason why we are not discussing upcoming events , where we can have influence with regard to decisions that will be taken by the 25 Member States , is because certain Members of this House want to re-run previous battles , previous elections , and to try to insist in future elections . #% Likewise I am opposed to the Home State Taxation scheme for SMEs . #% I can think of many good reasons for the EU to embrace the culture of life , the dignity of the human person and God . #% I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament 's report , specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters . #% They need to give us assurances that it is in the best interests of the children to stay in Romania and indeed we need to know that they are in appropriate homes as we speak . #% But facts from impact assessment analysis , consumer surveys and so on remain hard to find . #% Flexibility , minimum regulation and a belief that farming and rural development are allies , not alternatives are , in my opinion , the way to proceed . #% Member States and the Council will betray the wider public purpose of this proposal if they fail to use the extra revenue from energy tax to offset excessive non-wage , tax-driven labour costs . #% That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules . #% If we had a policy of maintaining proper prices , then lower quotas would be much more acceptable in the fishing regions . #% To their credit , some Members , especially Dutch Members , only take the reimbursement of the tickets . #% Are we going to use this handbook , or are we going to use similar measures , to ensure that the reconstruction effort in Haiti is professionally carried out ? #% It helped refocus governments ' attention on issues of racism , which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown . #% In fisheries , the policy always seems to be about reducing the catch . #% We do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty there and so Morocco has no right whatsoever to discuss access to EU vessels there , nor for that matter has the EU any right to enter into such negotiations with Morocco or to allow EU flag vessels to go there as has happened in the past . #% The short-sighted and narrow economic outlook of the Irish Government , which disregarded workers ' rights and entitlements in favour of maximising profits has led to a situation in which 543 workers on Irish Ferries face redundancy and replacement by workers earning less than 50 % of the Irish minimum wage . #% I would ask that this be taken into consideration , because that has been the foundation of the rural model that the European Union put in place . #% Europe needs to take a confident and unified step forward . #% I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% Again , it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there . #% But what use will all this valuable work be if , concurrently , we allow GM to infiltrate our crops , and thus our food and produce ? #% Appropriate accommodating monetary policy is not lax monetary policy . ' #% Any waste coming from continental Europe will most likely be shipped through the Irish Sea , putting us at additional risk . #% I would remind this House that early in the 1990s the Commission initiated a report on Northern Ireland fisheries . #% They want help with new technology . #% As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back . #% That makes it impossible for Members to be here . #% I am sure you agree with me that a victim of serious crime endures great pain and suffering , and this is doubly traumatic in a foreign country . #% I would suggest that the direction to take - if the President-in-Office could comment - is to reduce our income tax and social charges which are too high , thereby improving the competitiveness of European industry . #% In the United States - and I speak so much about it because I visited it recently to study carefully what is happening in that country - they have trading permits for sulphur dioxide . #% I therefore welcome this initiative that acknowledges the international nature of environmental damage . #% Trade relations must be based on the needs of the majority of the population , not the greed of tiny elites and corporations . #% As you said , the solution must be lasting , fair and legally viable . #% The Commission response to this , however , has been stony-faced and ideological . #% This surely neither is good neighbourliness nor reflects an . #% Furthermore , the cowardice of EU Member States in refusing a visa to President Chen Shui-bian to visit Europe is self-serving and counterproductive . #% Parliament is undoubtedly becoming more and more , as a result of your leadership , meaningful to the ordinary citizens of the Member States . #% It is important to point out that , as a cross-border activity , trafficking knows no borders . #% It is quite obvious , of course , that small countries like Ireland , Belgium and Luxembourg need free trade , but a European Union with a single market or a North American single market is an entirely different proposition . #% It is , in my view , right for the United States and the rest of the Western world to seek to destroy Al-Qaida and eliminate Osama Bin Laden , but so far they have failed . #% This European causebook is very much to be welcomed and I hope that we will be able to support this report . #% The EU Parliament too often closes its eyes to the persecution of such Protestants within its bounds . #% I thank the honourable Member , Mr Cushnahan . #% If they are , they should not be , as the payments can only be made to active producers , who farm and keep land in good agricultural condition . #% We have raised this matter in the Committee on Fisheries many times and the Commission says that this provision is redundant , that Article 10 in the new basic regulation allows Member States to enact stricter measures for their vessels . #% It is clear that there is a close link between poverty , economic and social development , and bush meat consumption . #% An emergency must be documented by a veterinary surgeon on call 24 hours per day , 7 days a week . #% Secondly , the people who have undertaken courses themselves - whether they be Community employment schemes or vocational training schemes - should be asked how they felt the courses provided responded to their needs and what the long-term prospects were . #% Not one single political party in Ireland argued against enlargement , either on the `` no '' side or the `` yes '' side : only one organisation - a non-party organisation which campaigned for `` no '' - argued against enlargement . #% Anything short of that would undermine the principles of CAP that , by and large , have served European farmers and consumers well . #% We need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today : that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market , that is set down in legislation . #% Finally , the Commission must urgently re-examine the proposed compensation package for beef farmers . #% It is not a perfect solution , it may not be totally achievable . #% In a word , agriculture in Ireland is a vital national interest . #% Cultural projects have a great potential in our Community framework - a potential not yet realised , unfortunately . #% It is right and proper that we put in place the most stringent controls in the entire area of food production , right through from producer to consumer . #% If the people of Sri Lanka , especially the doubters , were able to see that there is a peace dividend , this would underpin the agreement and encourage support for it . #% 
The four countries that have met the objectives are Spain , Portugal , Denmark and Finland . #% A major error in the installation of dishwashers and washing machines over the years -- certainly in my country and , I suspect , elsewhere -- has contributed greatly to this problem of foam in water systems . #% In fact , despite repeated appeals to Commissioner Fischer Boel to allow the ruling to be reconsidered and allow ethanol to be produced in these factories using the sugar beet immediately available , I have been assured that the plants will be completely dismantled . #% But of this I am certain : society will not tolerate , and must be protected from , any intrusion , deliberate or otherwise , that reduces the dignity and the sanctity of each human being to an object of scientific manipulation . #% Finally , Taoiseach , you deserve a rest after all your hard work . #% These proposals must be changed substantially before they would be acceptable . #% So even if the Council was able , in its wisdom , to accept a programme to limit fishing effort , that would not end the story , for there would be ever-increasing demands from the industry to allow more fishing . #% I welcome the fact that their decision clears the way for the conclusion of the accession negotiations for the first new Member States . #% I want to say , on behalf of my own group , that although you find yourself in an extremely difficult personal position , you have behaved with honour personally , as President of this House , from the very first moment this issue was placed before you . #% I certainly feel very strongly about this . #% It is important to place particular emphasis on the promotion of sustainable transport links with these disadvantaged regions if they are to share equally in the benefits of a unified single market . #% How can the Commission claim to advocate a safer working environment for fishermen and crew members while at the same time penalising the owners of the vessels who want to carry out measures to improve safety on board ? #% Speaking personally , I would like to see a full , thorough and impartial investigation into the state of those who have disappeared in Turkey , but the question was in relation to the Moscow mechanism and , for the reasons given , I think the views and replies given should stand . #% Access to documents from a Member State that are classified as secret may be granted only where that Member State has given its prior agreement . #% While the European Union remains one of the major donors , both the UNHCR and the World Food Programme are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to run the refugee camps . #% So it is relevant to refer to this . #% I would argue that , having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe , if we are to create European citizens , we must have services of general interest universally available , accessible , affordable and of high quality . #% I fully commend you , Taoiseach , and the Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Brian Cowen , for all your work on this . #% The possibility of strengthening the justice and home affairs provisions of the Treaty in order to assist in the fight against international crime is also being considered . #% In the UK , for example , during the World Cup football matches , 30 % of those making online bets on UK services were women . #% I encouraged Mr von Wogau to table this question because I believed that Parliament would treat this important precedent in a fair and balanced way - and indeed it has . #% In consequence , hundreds of exceptionally qualified young Protestant applicants have been refused admission to the police , not on merit , but because there is not a matching quantity of applicants from the Catholic community . #% There is also a former state company in Ireland , now privately owned , which services and maintains airlines . #% However , I absolutely reject all sections of this report that call for support for the Commission 's common consolidated corporate tax base . #% One ironic aspect of this report is that they are trying to push for alternative types of tobacco . #% It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach . #% The mining industry has got away with it for far too long . #% In some cases the children are never found . #% The Environment Committee of the European Parliament will continue to play an important co-ordinating role in this regard . #% In my own country , the Bantry Bay coastal zone chart is the only agreed integrated coastal zone management plan in the whole of the country at the present time . #% I urge the Commission to carry out an evaluation in these two areas to see if there is more potential in them as initiatives in the field of agricultural activity . #% Dover and Wexford are only two examples of what is to come . #% Could I ask colleagues who have problems with this to contact me in my office here as soon as possible . #% I would also like to draw attention to the regrettable situation that has developed there . #% Madam President , on behalf of my political group and my Prime Minister and the British Government , I very much welcome the contribution the EU is making in this area . #% That , of course , is in anticipation of the EU Constitution , within which that harmonisation has a key role to play . #% As regards utification , I take note of the Commission 's caution in relation to an agriculture directive concerning water pollution . #% We expect the Council to build confidence into this system and not undermine it . #% We must continue with the dialogue . #% In the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland there is a high preponderance of conacre lettings , whereby an active farmer rents land for ten months each year from an inactive landowner . #% Another constituent got as far as London where he was then refused boarding on a continuing flight out of London to Europe . #% To conclude these brief remarks , I commend the Brok report to the House . #% There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme . #% I am somewhat disappointed by one of the comments in the report stating that common rules of evidence must be established . #% I strongly support the rapporteur 's idea of creating a European agency to assist the various aspects of language policy . #% Already scientists inform us that the last decade was the warmest on record and that 2007 was one of the top 10 warmest years . #% Apart from the obvious environmental and other benefits , this can actually be justified on competition grounds . #% We welcome the acceleration of the energy market , though there is a risk of that aim clashing with the aim of sustainable development . #% The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate frauds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets . #% The Commission must now complete its consultation and swiftly bring forward ambitious proposals to ensure that governance of financial firms will help prevent , not facilitate , future crises . #% Some did not quite accept what I believe is also a necessary requirement , that in the matter of policy formulation and implementation they carry a general responsibility for their departments , answerable to the college but accountable to this Parliament . #% Finally , I should like very briefly to quote the following : ' Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day , teach a man to fish and you feed him for life ' . #% As we say in the resolution , it leaves domestic workers more likely to face discrimination and , indeed , multiple forms of discrimination . #% I am therefore calling for the introduction of a `` Carbon Labelling '' system , which would give consumers the information to make responsible and wise choices . #% The accession of the ten new countries hailing from the former Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia , the Baltics and the Mediterranean is , undoubtedly , the most significant and historic event in the history of the Union . #% Also , if we are serious about their value abroad , we must ensure more protection from third countries . #% As a democrat I have to accept the result of the vote on the Rothley report even if I do not agree with it . #% Mr President , African countries have made solemn commitments to democracy and the protection of human rights on numerous occasions : under the NEPAD agreement and the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement , to name but two . #% Are we seriously saying that here in Europe we value our inventiveness less than those countries new to innovation and inventions ? #% Health and education programmes must be targeted at the African continent where the AIDS plague is out of control . #% With regard to the delivery of arms , they would be allowed into countries which have not signed international human rights conventions . #% I want to underscore the importance of the present period . #% The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future . #% Tonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation -- to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases -- should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense . #% In its Agenda 2000 Communication , the Commission retained the priority policy goal of promoting economic and social cohesion . #% I have spoken to Mr Bradbourn , the rapporteur , and he can accept this amendment if the House accepts it . #% 
We must get involved in the debate , we have to persuade people here and in our own Member States . #% The Commission has made several proposals for programmes - Thermie II , Synergy , Save II - which were , however , not accepted by the Council or provided with adequate funding . #% You gave some assurances earlier today at some meetings and perhaps you would clarify for all of us what exactly you said . #% Mr President , it is regrettable that we are having to discuss this White Paper in an inappropriate legal framework . #% That has happened in this case . #% Frankly , in our opinion , this is not the time . #% We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it . #% That will help create trade diversification in our manufacturing and service economy base and stimulate economic growth to the benefit of European businesses and consumers alike . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the Irish presidency , the Taoiseach , Minister Roche and Minister Cowen for the progress they have made on the European Constitution . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck on their excellent work on the 2003 budget . #% It is entirely appropriate at this stage that the European Parliament does not express a definitive view on the qualities of the Treaty of Nice , because we recognise - as the Treaty itself does - that more needs to be done . #% It amazes me that we can write a whole strategy without ever mentioning the words ` spirit ' or ` spirituality ' . #% We must give consumers the choice . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , I welcome the priorities of the Irish presidency put forward here today . #% I do not know how someone living in the Dark Ages , who believes in military blocs , global militarization and imperialism can be considered a visionary . #% We have tabled an amendment which would set as a prime objective the need to ensure that fish stocks and other marine species remain abundant . #% I urge you to support my amendments . #% I should like to point out to him that unfortunately I am not the master of whether I get the opportunity to put a question to him , or any other minister in this House , during the course of the debates - it is the group which decides who takes the floor . #% If you present us with very vague proposals , that will certainly delay implementation and lead to concern and disappointment throughout the EU . #% The involvement of the social partners in this whole area is vital because , unless we can get broad agreement between the unions , employers and other social partners , then the essential elements involved in the whole area of employment and training will not be willing to come together to find solutions . #% The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes , including the tobacco , and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them . #% I could not agree that there is any need for that . #% They need far-reaching and tangible help . #% Each of those choices had serious disadvantages . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission 's document . #% I come from an agricultural background and it seems to me that what you need to control is the whole life span of the animal from the moment it is born to the time it is slaughtered . #% We worry unduly about the countries which will stay out and pursue soft currency policies in order to gain competitiveness . #% This resolution would call for a moratorium on new deep sea drilling until the standards have been improved and met . #% With the aviation industry set to lose upward of $ 1 billion as a result of the volcanic ash cloud , the EU must act quickly and decisively to ease the financial blow on the aviation industry . #% None of our countries should hesitate about signing up to closer cooperation in the fight against such crimes . #% I was pleased to hear President Santer acknowledge that mistakes were made by the Commission . #% That temporary tie-up funding is part of a rescue and restructuring package severely curtails its usefulness as a support measure ; and that the aid ceiling has only increased to EUR 30 000 over 3 years is also very restrictive and inequitable in relation to other sectors . #% The way to do that for the European Union should be as follows : instead of sending armies to areas of conflict , we should be sending the philosophy and principles of peace , plus a large team of officials to promote dialogue . #% I welcome the fact that this regulation foresees five different ways in which an SE can be established . #% Finally , the bottom line in terms of protectionism is that we have to protect the rights of citizens , whether they are inside or outside the European Union . #% The directive on misleading and comparative advertising ( 2006/114/EC ) , which applies to business-to-business transactions , is insufficient in providing an effective remedy and is also inadequately enforced by Member States . #% I am particularly concerned that my own Member State , Ireland , is seeking derogations yet again . #% With relation to this whole spamming issue , everybody in Parliament is extremely frustrated with the campaign that is taking place . #% I want to ask the Commission when we can expect to see a proposal for a directive on organ transplants . #% However , it also contains comments with which I profoundly disagree . #% We also have a common line among the committees : the rapporteurs in the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - respectively responsible for instruments for cooperation with industrialised countries and instruments for human rights and democracy - have adopted the very same approach as I have . #% Mr President , Commissioner , first I would like to say how truly thrilled I was to hear that the Belgian Presidency has made the issue of children 's rights part of its presidency programme . #% High Representative , we wish you every success in this task . #% I do not agree with all of it , of course , but nevertheless it was agreed by a majority . #% As has already been said , it was supported unanimously in committee . #% Mr President , this report concerns the proposed adoption by the European Union of the United States ' energy star programme as it applies to office and communication technology equipment . #% Since that awful incident , the bodies of four dead Romanians have been found inside a container bound for Canada in the Italian port of Livorno . #% in writing . - The concept of the European Innovation Partnership is a vital part of the commitments under the flagship initiative . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the Commissioner is telling us that the Memorandum of Understanding was drawn up under Article 122 , part 2 . #% It shows how little understanding this group has of the basic tenets of the rule of law in a democratic state . #% Is this what you really want ? #% However the willingness of the Paris Club to act in this case begs the question whether debt relief decisions are being made on the basis of need or that of US political imperatives ? #% The first concerns the point of procedure addressed by Mr Oostlander , namely that various colleagues felt , because of the sensitivity of the issue in hand , that they should like to have in their own language , as is their right , the text of the report and all the amendments to it . #% Only a breakthrough into the export market can save us . #% These are such major infrastructural works that they require massive amounts of people to be employed which gives a kick-start to many economies . #% We need a reply . #% Thank you , Mr President , and Happy Christmas ! #% However , those people without skills seeking to integrate into the workplace have little or no chance of taking up remunerative and rewarding employment unless they learn a new trade or a different work practice . #% I welcome the reference to resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka given my recent involvement in this area as head of the EU electoral observation mission . #% What the Commission is proposing is simply that export refunds would not be paid if the rules on welfare during transport were broken . #% It is the ethos in my own country , and I would like to encourage it . #% Those doctors -- a consultant oncologist and a paediatrician -- who sacrificed their whole careers for their courageous action , have been in Ireland for over a year in an overcrowded hostel with no certainty that they will not be sent back to persecution and death . #% Therefore , I call on the Council now to ask the Commission to draw up a European Union regulation on the role and duties of au pairs but , more importantly , on the duties and responsibility of the families who invite them into their homes . #% It can be said that , had the process not been in place , up to 1000 further deaths could have occurred in that period in Northern Ireland . #% Of course , this is nothing new . #% The Lamy strategy would save lives , and pharmaceutical companies will not be losing revenue because the people in these countries are too poor to buy the medication as it stands . #% 
In Ireland we are developing a nationalist strategy to ease administrative burdens and small businesses , relieve burdens on small businesses and improve access to finance , as well as support business start-ups . #% The Irish presidency and members of governments generally find themselves in this category . #% Europe must not be allowed to export its excess capacity . #% Unfortunately , a majority in this Parliament convinced others that the vote should not go ahead . #% Mr President , another year , another report , but what real change ? #% The success of the Irish minister at the Transport Council has been documented here . #% This is something on which the EU Food and Veterinary Office must focus in the immediate future . #% If the Commission succeeds in cutting aid to cereal farmers it may later try the same action in other sectors . #% The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country . #% We can do it if we wish . #% It is ethically wrong to harm or destroy some human lives for the potential benefit of others , and according to key international scientific leaders , research taking place in the United States is proving that using the embryo is unnecessary . #% However , I believe it is up to the British Government to regulate on this issue , not the European Union , to ensure firms and government bodies live up to their payment obligations . #% Such a step , regrettable as it is , would have been unnecessary if the political establishment in Ireland had made any effort to persuade voters to ratify it . #% We must not do nothing . #% They are entitled to look to our institutions to protect their jobs . #% For social reasons we need to make an investment and I am glad to hear accompanying measures being spoken about . #% So we were told with some certainty that it would not take Kabul . #% Firstly , labelling food such as soya beans , which are used in thousands of food preparations , is not practical . #% We want to show solidarity with the people of Eastern Europe and to give them the cohesion funds and agricultural funds that we ourselves received . #% If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems , instead of going at it in the opposite direction . #% In banning some of the objects the Commission recognises that these substances are dangerous . #% In remarkably similar circumstances , the failure to renew the last agreement with Morocco , which expired at the end of November 1999 , has again led to the need to seek increased fishing opportunities elsewhere in order to offset some of the hardship caused by the loss of access to Moroccan waters . #% This treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts , and without it , the prospects for progress in nuclear disarmament are considerably reduced . #% Those same three principles are at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland . #% The Commission proposals concerning the development of food legislation and food safety are positive . #% But , within that limit of 1.27 % it is very difficult to see adequate resources being provided to ensure that this enlargement will satisfy the applicants and their citizens . #% Belgium has signed , but has not ratified the Treaty . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% It was the Committee on Budgetary Control of Parliament which began years ago to insist that we should give , as parliamentarians , this report the weight that it deserves . #% It is up to us as legislators and as rule makers to ensure that the legislation and the regulations that we put down do not impede private industry and private business to give them the right atmosphere , the right opportunity in which to thrive and to grow . #% The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq . #% In the amendments to my report , we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed , including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market , either voluntarily or , if necessary , with legislation . #% President , the basic premise of terrorism is that the unexpected , the unconsidered , the unbelievable will terrify the population into accepting political claims , whether they are rational or not . #% I would be appalled at that , but I am sure it is something she would never do . #% In addition , more trade negotiations and more trade union negotiations took place at a national level and , over seven different years , there were four different programmes to guarantee the rights of workers and the right to participation of workers ' representatives . #% Finally , there is only one person in the room tonight who will have a vote in my election : Commissioner Flynn will have the opportunity to vote for me . #% To many observers it appears to have been in the end about egos and macho behaviour all round - all in the context of an economic turnaround in Ireland in the last six to seven years that is the envy of many . #% I have always thought of myself as an Irish Republican , as indeed do the McCartney family . #% Many of these older farmers are at present subject to scaremongering , with inaccurate information from their cooperatives . #% I have seen letters from small companies across Europe which are supportive of this directive . #% No discrimination against the Spaniards is intended here . #% The tenor of his remarks is to condemn reprocessing as a sinister activity . #% The present instability and violence can not and must not continue indefinitely . #% The Commission President and Enrique Barón Crespo have both referred to this question of the interinstitutional dialogue and balance and President Prodi has talked about the very sensitive issue of call-back procedure . #% That promise was never fulfilled . #% In the face of genuine asylum-seeking , this is not good enough . #% Nevertheless , this will remain an essential mechanism for assisting heavily export-dependent sectors to maintain a position in export markets in periods when prices are plunging and markets are uncertain . #% She adds today a preface which says that if these matters were not investigated then the public might feel certain things . #% In this case , in particular , the fact that although fresh evidence has come to light and a re-trial has been denied is despicable . #% in writing . - Ireland 's society is ageing at an unprecedented rate . #% The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming . #% To be a credible military super power , of course , it needs a space policy . #% Yet , at the same time , the same EU deems it appropriate that the budget of this place increases by 6 % . #% Does it not strike you as strange that they are the countries that do not want to harmonise tax and , in fact , do not want to interfere in other peoples ' taxation systems ? #% There are still a lot of important items on the agenda for completion by the end of your presidency . #% Incursions by the Israeli military forces into Palestinian territories must be halted immediately and there must also be a lifting of restrictions that are imposed on the Palestinian people . #% Members of the European Parliament , quite correctly , are harsh in their condemnation of the crushing of the right to dissent and to demonstrate freely in Azerbaijan , and I can not let this opportunity pass to also condemn the disgraceful repression of protests by the Danish police in Copenhagen in recent days , who arrested up to 1 000 entirely peaceful protestors , handcuffed them and left them lying for hours in the cold . #% In Ireland , it is approximately 15 % and this has major implications for women 's standard of living , for their families and their quality of life . #% Instead , intended ambiguity prevails so as to facilitate Morocco 's abuse of Western Saharan waters and to avoid facing up to its illegal claim to the territory . #% Instances were found where vessels were larger in reality than was actually indicated in the national registry of vessels . #% We have to be careful and I would trust your experience and judgement in that . #% How much innovation has taken place in the Commission , or indeed in the Parliament may I say ? #% When it comes to taking legal action it is up to individual citizens themselves to take up these cases and that can be extremely difficult and expensive . #% It is seen as being interfering , over-burdensome , over-arching and , indeed , uncaring when it comes people 's everyday concerns . #% Finally , during the course of these debates our citizens will be expecting clear evidence that the European Union is capable of providing clear-cut and effective solutions to these major political , social and economic problems . #% You have a job to do : go out and sell it and give Member States every assistance you can to sell it . #% 
Through a rearrangement and a paring down of our present policies we can find the resources that are necessary to finance the enlargement of 100 million people . #% One problem that I have about it is that there is a natural tendency to concentrate much more on the 4 % of the budget that might have been lost , or the 2 % that probably was lost , than the 98 % of the budget that was properly spent . #% Finally , as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House , we should use the provisions of the directive , the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use . #% It has a duty to increase the safety of citizens facing dangers posed by the concentration of hazardous substances in the atmosphere , particularly in urban areas . #% We wish to show our solidarity with the Italian process . #% We are looking at Africa but we must also look around us , to our own local societies . #% It only sets out basic obligations and general principles . #% We are a multi-billion pound , multi-billion dollar talking-shop , as far as the citizens of Europe and the world are concerned . #% I , too , would urge the Council to reconsider its attitude to this office . #% We must strengthen our diplomatic actions in relation to Burma by prohibiting investment or loans to all state-owned companies , not just those already banned . #% On a broader budgetary matter , I welcome the fact that under the 2004 budget Parliament 's Committee on Budgets supports the following measures : the need to increase rural development aid measures under the EU common agricultural policy ; the need to guarantee the safety of food products , both from within the territories of the Union and from third countries ; greater co-ordination of security measures at the EU 's external borders and improved EU immigration and asylum policies ; and promotion of an EU media space to disseminate information on the workings of the European Union and raise public awareness of the impact of European Union legislation on the day-to-day lives of the citizens of Europe . #% The citizens of this Union are our judges and juries . #% Effective measures need to be introduced to prevent the formation and activities of violent groups in Europe and collaboration between such groups . #% The Commission must support educational and training programmes , to ensure that business structures take account of the opportunities which can be secured from the Internet and e-commerce in general . #% At the same time there is a need for an important balance between the Commission , Parliament and the rights of governments . #% I believe that we must increase mesh size to prevent unnecessary discarding of juvenile fish . #% It is a renewal for four years and for the first time it gives access to EU vessels to the pelagic stocks . #% Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public . #% We are talking about major European oil companies and they should be held accountable for their activities . #% The fact is that if the ten applicant countries proposed by the Commission - for whose efforts I am grateful and I thank Commissioners Prodi and Verheugen in particular - are to be part of the enlarged Europe which Mr Cohn-Bendit is dreaming of , then please tell the people of my country , on behalf of the Green Party of Europe , that they should vote ` yes ' to the Treaty of Nice . #% Likewise , the opportunity of rural development and new technology in terms of creating farm and part-time employment for both women and men must , in every case , be vigorously pursued . #% With regard to a proposal for four industry representatives on the board , it would be helpful for the Commission to clarify that the various sectors of the maritime industry would be represented . #% It is high time to put real money into supporting renewable energy sources . #% We must insist that all Member States play by the rules , since capital investment in smaller states will never be forthcoming . #% I would like to repeat the call made by the presidency on 6 January asking for a public investigation into alleged electoral irregularities . #% The four-month time frame that we have in Parliament at second reading did not allow a proper teasing-out of exactly what was in the Commission 's mind . #% Further discussion with the OIE , the World Organisation for Animal Health , is urgently necessary to ensure that an infected country can regain its FMD-free status as soon as possible . #% We must lead by example and do the same in Belfast . #% The environmental impact of pirate fishing vessels is virtually impossible to evaluate as by definition data on catches are non-existent or , at the very best , unreliable . #% There has been some dispute , as this is an issue dealing with counter-terrorism and serious crime , over the fact that it should be done under a framework decision and not a directive . #% Too much attention has been given to the monetary aspect of EMU and not enough to the economic provisions . #% To do otherwise in my view would be to politicise unnecessarily what is now a priority EU agenda and indeed would do nothing to restore consumer and farmer confidence . #% Mr President , I support the proposals in the Linkohr report . #% Therefore it is always difficult to interpret any differences . #% There is no longer any public health justification for imposing an absolute requirement for all donations to be non-remunerated . #% I was pleased to table amendments to Mrs Napoletano 's report to look for a much more sustained approach with better funding for our urban areas and I hope the Commission will take these views on board when they produce their Agenda 2000 proposals , following negotiations with ministers in Council . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report . #% Madam President , in relation to Iraq I have swung from anger , through despondency , to determination . #% However , I oppose the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax as I believe the principle of subsidiarity should apply and decisions in relation to taxation should be retained at national level . #% Finally , we all have to take responsibility for what has happened and to shoulder a little of the blame . #% Mr President , six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries . #% The hierarchy system as a priority order forces legislators in waste prevention and management policy to apply prevention as key , followed by re-use , then recycling , with recovery and disposal at the lower end . #% I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the weaknesses identified in the various reports . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Fatuzzo on his report . #% I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force . #% It is in the interest of both the EU and the United States that the present rift in our relationship be healed . #% Madam President , I am deeply appalled by the latest , dangerous escalation of violence in the Middle East which must be ended . #% Ultimately , both the environment and vehicle operators stand to gain from this proposal if carbon monoxide can be measured and then cut back and if vehicle performance can be improved . #% You became Finance Minister just as Ireland 's Celtic Tiger was transforming the country from one of the EU 's poorest nations to its financial summit . #% This is all about profit and greed . #% Only in this way can fishermen contribute to and influence Community policy . #% At the very least the Irish compromise should have taken into account the will of Parliament , particularly in relation to a number of crucial issues , for example the temperature of the vehicle in which animals are transported and the fact that it will not be mandatory to unload them temporarily at ports . #% So what are you going to say to the stakeholders in January , Commissioner ? #% One of the difficulties we face is that we have different legal systems within the EU Member States , which have built up bodies of law and precedent . #% Indeed , they are even trying to close the important link between Belfast and the port of Larne . #% Mr President , I have a poster in front of me here which says no to war . #% My last point is that we should not rush towards achieving all these goals in the short term . #% This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations . #% I read recently in the Financial Times that half the disputes which customers have with the Visa credit card company relate to Internet transactions . #% I respect the point you make , that this was discussed by the Conference of Presidents last week and given the situation at that time it was decided not to place it on the agenda this week . #% In the context of the forthcoming negotiations on future relations between the European Union and the ACP countries under the Lomé Convention , a stable political system , full respect for human rights , effective participation by society , allied to good government and sound administration , should be recognized as fundamental foundations for sustainable development and the focus of our development policy . #% He was Minister for Finance as Ireland ascended to wealth , and how did he choose to spend it ? #% Firstly , the continuing attempt to create a European Public Prosecutor 's office , is something which I am resolutely opposed to . #% If that were the case , it would be economically unviable for transporters to have such a vehicle . #% Mr President , considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common European security and defence policy . #% First , Mr President , warmest congratulations on your election . #% 
In all of these instances a cessation of conflict had generally been brokered by the UN itself and a form of peace had ensued . #% The conflict must end . #% Mr President , on a point of order and by way of follow-up to Mr Newton Dunn 's point of order , I have been sitting here listening with great interest to what Mr Nielson has said , but had a specific question to put forward in part three . #% When added to its cruel history and continuing persecution of Christians , it is clear that Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without . #% I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on steering this package , which was not entirely unanimous , through the Commission so skilfully . #% Each government within the European Union will also have to set up central contact points , which will provide consumers with the requisite information about out-of-court resolution disputes bodies which are operational within their jurisdiction . #% in writing . - Today , Parliament voted to block the authorisation of thrombin for use as a food additive . #% This issue should be addressed as a matter of urgency particularly if , as we would all wish , the European Union is to deal with this problem affecting citizens of the Union , and if the required credibility of the Union in the eyes of the people of the Member States is to be won back . #% One could almost call it an outrage , in fact , given the hundreds of thousands of EU citizens - most of them very young people - whose lives are being completely destroyed by the drug barons who make themselves vast fortunes , assisted very often by inadequate company legislation . #% I urge everyone here today to support this amendment . #% These instruments are in the spirit of that agreement , which should be continued . #% The goodwill has been translated into three packages : Northern Ireland got Priority 1 status when its economic development stage would not have justified it ; the Delors package and the International Fund for Ireland all together have made a fairly remarkable contribution to getting voluntary workers to come together . #% However , it is now out in the open . #% I am pleased that you have done so so far , and we look forward to your next communications on energy efficiency . #% . Europe 's transport system is expected to see an increase of road freight by 2013 of more than 60 % . #% We must not be involved in promoting the consumption of all fish no matter what species , the area where it was caught or the gear that was used . #% This would be a retrograde step which risks undermining the positive results now being achieved by the present programme of structural fund aid in some parts of the Union , such as Ireland , for example . #% We have a lot to learn from each other on this and exchange of best practice is important . #% I would argue that sustainable development and employment are part and parcel of the social dimension of the European Union . #% Mr Gahrton said that his government stated that it is only after a UN Security Council resolution has been adopted . #% This would make things happen in Europe and give considerable added value to the European Union 's work on energy . #% The reality is , of course , that we must try and find solutions and work towards them . #% I support the enlargement of the European Union . #% With regard to 2 other dates I did not receive any daily allowance for the Parliament and these facts have been confirmed in writing to me by the EP services . #% Universal suffrage in elections to the Yemeni Parliament is especially praiseworthy in the context of the all-male electorates in neighbouring states in the region . #% We need to cooperate more closely to combat organised crime and international terrorism . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the very comprehensive reply which he has given . #% Madam Chairman , I share the disappointment expressed in this report at the inadequacy of the Commission 's response to the crisis in the fishing industry , but I will not pretend to be surprised . #% Róisín McAliskey is the daughter of a former Westminster MP and this treatment of her is against all principles of human rights in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament . #% I congratulate Mrs de Esteban Martin on the immense work she has put into it but I think that when it comes to voting we will either have to abstain or vote against because of the complexity . #% I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work . #% If you look at Holland and Germany , on whose behalf there was so much crying in this Parliament , you will find that the single market has given them immense benefits and they have had extremely positive balances in their trade with the rest of the Union over the years . #% Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State - 12 Member States in fact - under the habitats directive at the moment . #% Unless Europe takes courageous steps now and encourages the USA to do likewise , the situation could very quickly become irretrievable . #% An amendment has been tabled calling for the directive to be transposed into national law by 13 June 2001 , instead of the Commission 's own proposal of 2002 . #% However , the Treaty clearly defines that and narrows down that role , namely that it only operates for European law . #% I , along with the people I represent , will take great delight in voting against it . #% The Council of Ministers will make very important decisions this week which we know will have a long-lasting effect on the future success and credibility of the European Union . #% As we are aware , the banking structure and its relationship with film varies across Europe . #% Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency . #% It is a mistake to move this far , this quickly , without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union . #% When he was defence Minister , Ariel Sharon masterminded the ` Operation Peace for Galilee ? invasion in 1982 . #% From an EU perspective and in the context of the application of the principle of subsidiarity we can not ignore the potential and desire of our citizens to participate in the work of nation-building . #% Madam President , I welcome this report by my colleague Mr Chichester . #% Like everybody else in this Parliament I share those concerns . #% In fact , this scheme was used to underpin the market and the price of cattle , rather than primarily to take out the disease in the older cow . #% The family , as was recognised by the drafters of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is fundamental in protecting and promoting the rights of the child . #% It is time that we realised that we must count the cost of processing the waste from these nuclear facilities as an intrinsic part of the cost . #% What is our responsibility as a result ? #% This funding must be allocated in an even-handed manner . #% While we understand the needs and requirements of many in the ten new Member States , it is of little comfort to those who will lose out substantially . #% It would suit them better if they attended committee and put their energy and effort into committee work instead of taking up your time . #% In the short time available , I want to add my voice to that of those in this Parliament who insist on greater protection of Europe ' s vital interests in the forthcoming world trade talks . #% So while such a move sounds easy - and to some it sounds very good - we have to ask a number of questions . #% The addition of ten or more net beneficiary countries will have a major impact on the budget . #% What I have not heard today - perhaps I missed it because I was a bit late for the President-in-Office 's speech at the beginning - is what progress has been made in relation to finding a vaccine . #% We finally got some movement from the Commission on the matter . #% Consumers can agree - prior to the conclusion of the contract - that they can not bring proceedings against the other party in the courts of the Member States where they are domiciled . #% In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to establishing gender equality right across a range of areas . #% Infrastructure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment . #% However , one of my key areas of concern with regard to the e-commerce and e-Europe revolution is equality of access for consumers . #% However , in the final analysis , whether you are new born or elderly , citizen or migrant , rural or urban , nobody should be at risk of violence . #% At a national level within Ireland , the post office network is under threat , particularly the smaller rural post offices that are not computerised and can not , therefore , offer an adequate level of service to citizens . #% Mr President , having seen over the years very difficult discussions in Parliament relating to this subject , it is indeed a pleasure for me this evening to see such widespread support for this report . #% Labelling , however , needs to be sensible . #% Sometimes it is better to say less than more in these issues . #% 
The accession negotiations still have to overcome other difficult issues such as state support to industry and levies on imports , but I believe they can be overcome . #% I would like to mention a number of issues here ; one relates to the European schools . #% This does not mean , however , drafting a lawyers ' charter , which is what we are in danger of doing . #% People are refusing to accept that there are drug addicts out there , that there are people suffering from drug addiction and that something must be done to ensure that these people are protected and that they are not criminalized . #% We must provide not only a forum at European level through a convention , but also ensure that there are fora in every Member State , so that people in each Member State can talk and debate with each other with other people in Europe . #% It has a much higher incidence among the dairy herds , than the suckler herds , probably because the dairy men could afford more concentrates traditionally over the years . #% At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public 's attention . #% Fundamental to farmers ' practice of constant innovation is free access and exchange of seeds and genetic material . #% Secondly and more importantly , effective control of arms exports is an essential part of a coherent policy that meets EU objectives on peace , respect for human rights and democracy . #% Finally , having met a group of disabled people from Ireland yesterday and today on their Freedom Drive in Strasbourg , I was pleased to note that the rapporteur has invited the Commission to put forward an initiative to make tourism and leisure establishments accessible to people with reduced mobility . #% Intensive negotiations will continue under the Irish presidency between now and 17 June , with a view to finalising the provisions of this new Treaty . #% Agriculture is a vitally important sector of the Irish economy and the protection of income levels of Ireland 's family farmers is central to our rural development aspirations . #% Mr President , thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise a matter with you . #% The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions , financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment , assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy . #% However , the legacy of the years where materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us , often with severe consequences . #% The British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence , trial by one 's peers , as in the Magna Carta . #% Time does not permit me to elaborate on the many aspects of SMEs which require our urgent attention , other than to say that SMEs should now receive greater priority in national and EU programmes for job creation . #% It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective . #% The multiannual programme is to cover the period 2004 - 2008 , and is valued , as we know , at EUR 129.62 million . #% In summary , the fleet reduction is urgently needed and it must be vigorously implemented . #% Mr President , I should like to welcome the Commissioner . #% It is vital to achieve the Lisbon targets , but as the shadow PSE rapporteur , I wish to complain about the procedure . #% I thank you and your staff for your help and consideration and for the speedy representation you made to both the Council and the Commission . #% Because there is a degree of complacency with regard to all EU change , every effort must be made in the months remaining before 1 January to alert consumers to the importance of what is happening and , more importantly , to assure them that their interests are placed at the forefront by those whose job it is to manage this important change . #% I would like to request that you inform the House , if possible this week , whether any efforts have already started on the part of both Parliament and the Commission to enable the citizens of Gibraltar to vote in the coming European elections . #% I do , however , wish to acknowledge the positive aspects of the Commission proposals , including the findings of the Evaluation Committee report , the simplification of procedures and the introduction of a single premium . #% This does not mean that we lost 5.9 % : it means we lost a small fraction of this sum , perhaps 1 % of the entire budget . #% There are in fact so many people who are long-term unemployed , who are living in difficult housing conditions , who are not being retrained for employment and who do not have educational opportunities . #% The year 2015 is a political date , not a scientific one . #% I started my presentation in defence of fishermen . #% For example , in Ireland , out of 48 000 cattle tested there has not been one reactor to the BSE test , and to me that is an indication that the disease is confined to other animals in the suckler cow and dairy herds . #% Talk about collateral damage ! #% Parliament has been at the forefront of promoting these measures . #% In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its everything-but-arms initiative . #% I am delighted that such an important opportunity has arisen for children to enjoy the same access to innovative new medicines as adults already enjoy . #% It is very close to the heart of the people of Ireland who , unfortunately , recently rejected the Nice Treaty , precisely because they misunderstood to some extent the nature of the European Union and what we are attempting to do in relation to the Rapid Reaction Force . #% The rural community has been under increasing pressure to survive . #% Peace , democracy and prosperity are as important today as they were fifty years ago . #% Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated . #% This report also helps French fishermen . #% In conclusion , I would urge that all future political cooperation with Malaysia be conditional upon the Malaysian Government 's abolition of the Internal Security Act and also the release of all political prisoners , so that all Malaysians may be assured that their basic human rights as enshrined in their constitution are respected . #% The Greens have tabled an amendment which is congruent with the position of most researchers in the field and this must be supported . #% Indeed I think other Members of this House , if there were any here , might want to know whether there is a fundamental cultural problem with the UK Government 's attitude to structural funds and regional policy ? #% I also wish to ask the President-in-Office to deal with the nuclear issue . #% I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority . #% We are extremely happy to totally support Mr Whitehead 's excellent report . #% There must be a total transition to exclusively peaceful means . #% To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks . #% Parliament may have the final say in signing off the accounts , but it is important to recall that 84 % of the Community budget is managed within the Member States . #% For some time Parliament , the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep . #% Technically speaking , there is no difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning . #% On our housing crisis ? #% I see this as the thin end of the wedge to force a common European tax policy on Ireland . #% It is going to take the candidate countries time to implement this full body of legislation . #% The Council of Europe is putting the finishing touches to the world 's first international convention on cyber-crime . #% We have made the point that they must be targeted . #% It is interesting to look around at other regions of the world to see how they deal with by-catch problems . #% I am not arguing for revision of the Maastricht convergence criteria , but I feel greater acknowledgement should be given to the ` E ' in EMU . #% It is really only Appendix I and Appendix II that require the sanction of the Conference of the Parties in this area . #% One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers . #% I am asking for cohesive action and for it to be made much clearer to the citizens how exactly these targets will be met - even if it is the hard way . #% European agriculture will always remain critical to the well-being of European rural economies - indeed , it represents the main option for economic activity . #% We can not really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector . #% At least that is what this report is saying , and I think that makes sense . #% He is fully correct in his approach . #% In other words , the current pillage of certain types , certain deep-water stocks by some EU countries would not be allowed to happen . #% 
We seem paralysed in the face of this obscenity . #% From the data which I am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact . #% In that sense , I would like to pledge my group and my time to working on that . #% The OECD calls a spade a spade . #% The European Union can not operate effectively unless there is cooperation and understanding between the Commission , Parliament and the Council . #% The attitude within the European Union towards asylum-seekers has to change . #% My Group will also , by way of amendment , be defending Parliament 's absolute right to express our opinion on the Commission 's updated opinion on Malta 's renewed application . #% That is why I welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council , our Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , is holding an extensive round of bilateral negotiations with European Union leaders at this particular time . #% Mr President , Commissioner , in October 2000 , in Seoul ASEM leaders gave a commitment to support human rights , democracy and the rule of law , as a cornerstone of future Asia/Europe cooperation . #% It is impossible to comply with and when the animals leave the EU it is impossible to monitor them . #% Mr President , I welcome the thrust of this report , which seeks to implement strict rules with regard to the operation of landfill sites within the territories of the Union . #% But the Data Protection Commissioner is concerned that any moves by the Irish authorities to bring in scanners goes through proper consideration and balances security needs with individual privacy rights . #% I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% I therefore would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work , to support her in making the case for a strong regional policy and for keeping the focus on our goal of economic and social cohesion . #% Fortunately we can draw on our experience of a change of currency in 1972 , when we broke with sterling . #% This all happened in front of witnesses who seem to have seen nothing . #% Finally , the danger now is that agreement at the IGC will be much more difficult to achieve because of the antiEuropean forces unleased in the United Kingdom . #% I would commend to the House that we put an end to this matter and recognise and salute the integrity of Mr Hernández Mollar , his committee and his services . #% No one in Europe has lost their identity but , and this is the important point , make them work together in their substantial common interests which are social and economic , as I often say ` spilling their sweat and not their blood ' , and by doing that we can breakdown the barriers and centuries and the new Europe will have evolved . #% We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up . #% Also it is now 20 years since Altiero Spinelli drafted his report , which recommended that a constitutional Treaty be agreed for the European Union and one of the key elements of his report back in 1984 was to give a stronger role to the European Parliament . #% I particularly welcome the proposal for a statutory right to interest on late payments . #% It is very important that the market for fish in the EU is reformed and consolidated . #% I do appreciate that I arrived just as you were moving on and I also thank Mr Juncker for his answer . #% We must ensure we take the necessary steps to ensure this industry achieves its full potential . #% Whether in Britain or in any other Member State , I think it is clearly a matter for those Member States to ensure that does not happen . #% How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming ? #% Thus there is a solid scientific basis for the proposed limit values . #% That is good , right and proper . #% We favour a quick deal but it is conditional on the Council and the Commission accepting our amendments , which are a genuine and committed attempt to ensure that the brave new world of electronic communications is genuinely universal . #% My hope is that this strategy at European level can help assist and support those most at risk from violence . #% Of course we must try to break into the lucrative American market , but first of all let us make sure that we produce programmes that will sell across our own borders , that people will be interested in and will buy , and thus add more to the pot for independent producers . #% The free movement of labour is one of the basic tenets on which the European Union relies and it is therefore up to us , the elected representatives of the European Union , to ensure that all our citizens have assess to affordable and speedy transport between the Member States of the Union . #% A recent study by the UK Department for International Development has estimated that 150 million people -- one-eighth of the world 's poorest -- regard wildlife as an important livelihood asset . #% I trust the Commission will be more forthcoming as to whether or not it believes such a trade is actually going on . #% What better way of doing that than engaging the best brains in Europe on behalf of the people to tackle the problems which worry the people ? #% Mr President , I would just like to thank those Members who voted for my report . #% Mr President , I had expected to recommend the House to adopt this draft regulation unamended at second reading . #% This is a voluntary scheme , but if firms genuinely want to improve their environmental policy and their environmental performance then any encouragement in that direction should be welcomed . #% Might I remind this House that after the Second World War we from the countries of Western Europe allowed Polish soldiers from German prisoner-of-war camps to be returned and fed to Stalin , who consumed them instantly , or slowly in Siberian gulags . #% in writing . - MEP Queiró has responded to the Commission 's communication ` An Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation ' and has highlighted several areas where policy considerations for the non-commercial air transport sector in general and business aviation have additional impact . #% in writing . - I wholeheartedly welcome this decision to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to assist the Waterford Crystal workers . #% It is equally important that the reform of the CAP should be considered in parallel with the reform of the Structural Funds because an essential component of structural policy throughout the Union should be the preservation of present population levels in rural areas and in the relatively isolated areas on the periphery of the Union . #% The need for stricter regulation and supervision of the financial crisis is as urgent as ever . #% Also , Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks . #% Commission : take him on . #% But over the next few weeks the Commission should and must carry out a full and independent evaluation of all the environmental public health risks of all operations of BNFL at the Sellafield nuclear plant . #% The gap is measured most starkly by the 18 million people out of work and up to 50 million suffering from social exclusion and poverty . #% I hope that politicians and local authorities in Ireland can join forces with members of the Greater London Assembly and other groups in England to intensify the battle to see that BNFL close down the nuclear white elephant of the Sellafield plant . #% We know what our obligations are . #% I have met many of them and have experienced at first hand their resourcefulness and dedication . #% The real danger for Europe is not the danger of a race to the bottom , but relates to the need for Europe to make sure that it is winning the race to stay ahead and that it does not sink to the bottom . #% I am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in Asia to notify us of the outbreak . #% No other Member State is at such a disadvantage . #% Yet it remains an absolute disgrace that this man has not yet been brought to justice . #% It is just not acceptable . #% The Commission is talking about the health of the European public , not delivering public health services . #% Therefore , I was determined from the outset to give the report a very tight structure so that people interested in different human rights issues and themes in different countries , could navigate it quickly and efficiently , as opposed to having a lengthy report with no headings , requiring people to read a third , half or indeed the whole report to find the area in which they were interested . #% It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002 . #% These investigations have to be carried out . #% Mr President , I want to express my appreciation of the way the Commission brought this proposal forward . #% Let me highlight some of the amendments . #% That is the prospect facing fishermen in the south and east of Ireland at the moment . #% Agriculture and forestry are the cornerstones of land use and the management of natural resources , and they serve at the same time as the basis for economic diversification there . #% This is a recipe for social and economic stagnation and environmental disaster . #% It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk . #% 
Every nation owes a duty to provide such services and that duty should not be evaded , or the quality of such services diminished , by allowing them to be provided by the cheapest cowboy source . #% I acknowledge , of course , as you have reported , the heightened anxieties of the representatives of the candidate countries following the Irish `` no '' to Nice . #% The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50 % , the further the money goes and the greater the impact . #% Our debate today is on the future of Europe and I might take that as a point of departure . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , rising food prices can bring governments to their knees . #% We are afraid that these monies will be denied to them in the future . #% However , what is important is the next stage : transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold . #% In Germany , believed by most people who work in this area to be the country where most of these difficulties exist , we have Mr Guy Foster and Mr Chris McMullen ; and probably one of the best-known cases of all , Lady Catherine Meyer , the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington , who has seen her two sons for precisely 24 hours in the past six years . #% We need legal certainty in the field of employment , both for employers and employees . #% However , despite these concerns , I have voted in favour of the report and I congratulate the rapporteur . #% Unchecked shipments usually end up in Ghana , Nigeria , India or Pakistan . #% I suggest to the presidency that , with regard to the many genuine difficulties that exist at the present time between Arab countries and the western countries , there is perhaps a need for a study on how best relations between the European Union and these countries might be improved . #% Your particular interest and feeling for this subject is inspirational to many of us here . #% Women are being used as the raw material for such research because there is an invasive procedure to extract eggs , the raw material for cloning . #% These are extremely serious criminal offences and in making these observations either one produces the evidence or one has the decency to withdraw . #% I would ask you to study that in full also , Mrs de Palacio . #% It is important that the emphasis on European added value in employment policy should not become an escape clause designed to mask the unwillingness of a number of social-democrat-led governments to embrace necessary domestic economic reform . #% I wish to convey to Mr Prodi our very great disappointment at the lack of involvement by the European Parliament in trade matters , which could have been rectified at Nice , but which was not . #% The European Union is the largest contributor of development aid in the world and therefore must continue to show real leadership when it comes to addressing humanitarian and development aid problems in the world . #% It is not in the interests of what we are trying to achieve . #% Mr Desama quotes regional planning , agriculture , fisheries , transport , combatting fraud and the symptoms and difficulties related to climate change . #% While I do not agree with the policy of the US - a policy of no aid without trade - it is essential that we remain rigorous and firm with our policy of no aid without linkage to democracy , human rights and freedom . #% You would eliminate another quarter if your farming and your forestry practices took carbon out of the air and put it back in the soil and the plants , where it should be . #% However , like Mrs Schörling , I would hope that we do not get into a fight which would further delay us on the question of the legal basis . #% Something that comes to mind is that we ought not to get carried away with emotion or lead people down the wrong path on this whole subject . #% It is right , however , that Parliament should emphasize that the development of democracy and respect for the rule of law is a priority and that steps will be taken if any applicant country displays manifest shortcomings in this respect . #% The practical ramifications and consequences of EMU for the consumer must be closely analysed and monitored . #% Discussion of regionalism at Singapore has already been called for by a number of World Trade Organization members and will probably be discussed there . #% Issues , including the status of Jerusalem , the borders of the Palestinian State , the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees , were all being discussed between the two sides last year . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for the thorough airing she gave to this subject and for the usefulness of her report . #% Mr President , I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level . #% This qualified me for the blind person 's pension and to be registered for blind in Ireland . #% If we are to set unreasonable objectives for recycling and recovery of packaging waste which take no account of capacity constraints , we might just as well get it over with now , book our slot in advance at the ECJ for non-implementation and spare the Commission a waste of envelopes on letters of formal notice and reasoned opinions under the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the Treaty . #% It proposes to simplify the procedure for registering new and existing substances and it will increase our knowledge of their effects and ensure safe use at all stages in their lifecycle . #% The report goes to great lengths to push these kinds of dangers under the carpet . #% Unfortunately , other Member States have not yet fully implemented the European legislation . #% What , if anything , did the information offices do to rebut the allegations made in this television programme ? #% Almost all of us know them off by heart , but Member States have so far taken very little action on them . #% I see that the Commissioner responsible , Mr Busquin , is in the Chamber . #% They think that by repeatedly swearing allegiance to that which voters , when permitted , have repudiated , they will somehow resuscitate it . #% Mr Söderman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year . #% It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States , faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to , show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China 's human rights record . #% Farmers must have guarantees of direct income supports at adequate levels over the medium to long term if they are to be in a position to plan for the future . #% Can we trust them ? #% Every year in the European Union around 45,000 people die and about 1.6 million are injured as a result of road traffic accidents . #% I do welcome this report . #% Mr President , the PROGRESS programme plays an important role in promoting employment and social solidarity and it is all the more important as , increasingly , the drive to put profits before people excludes and marginalises so many . #% When oil prices rise we conserve energy , when they fall we do not . #% If you look at the fact that we gave approximately EUR 900 million to Ethiopia between 2002 and 2005 , we do not seem to be getting any respect for human rights in that country . #% By this I do not mean merely paying lip-service to the combat against child labour , or putting in place cursory or superficial monitoring systems . #% To that end , may I finish by echoing Mrs Roure 's call for both the Commission and the Council to put their money where their mouth is as regards tackling inequality across the Union . #% We must make every effort to protect and save them for the possibility of future use . #% This will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller Member States to have one Member of the Commission will be downgraded . #% A recent meeting with astronauts made me more aware of the potential for science in Europe if we take the messages of the Lisbon declaration seriously . #% I would sincerely hope the Council and the Commission have taken note of our views . #% I am particularly pleased that my group , the Union for Europe Group , played an important part in ensuring that this vitally important matter is the subject of a report from the Regional Affairs Committee . #% The nuclear industry however still affects our environment and health as foreign nuclear power plants have affected our seas and countryside causing health problems for our population . #% My proposal to make the Development Cooperation Instrument the single administrative and procedural regulation for development cooperation not only gives the Commission the administrative simplification and flexibility it seeks , but also ensures that policy implementation is kept apart from the unpredictability of political life . #% At the same time , workers see the banks being recapitalised , while small and medium-sized businesses - the drivers of economic growth - are being starved of funds and jobs are being lost . #% The conciliation compromise was welcomed by the three institutions , by myself , by my European Parliament colleagues , by Minister Pröll , on behalf of the European Council , and by the Environment Commissioner , Mr Dimas . #% The Union itself must be prepared to take up the challenges posed by enlargement by improving its decision-making capacity and improving the functioning of its institutions . #% As a result , a supplement to the 1993-1996 protocol with Mauritania was adopted which aimed to offset the loss of fishing opportunities for the Community fleet in Morocco by allowing for 18 Spanish vessels to transfer to the waters of Mauritania , a geographical area close to where they operated previously . #% It is too early for some stocks and is too late for others in the context of overfishing . #% It will not be retirement for him , but a new phase in his life . #% Irish politicians from the main political parties are now queuing up to score points on this issue , but they should be criticized for their unflinching enthusiasm for the single market in the past . #% Vitally important is the introduction of means of using the present crisis to respond to the environmental crisis by increasing efficiency , through thorough environmental management systems . #% 
Mr President , I should also like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on the tremendous proposal she has put before us . #% How can the Commission help the social partners , the employers and the trade unions to get on board and run model action programmes ? #% However , derogations should only be made on a case-by-case basis so the risk of importing diseases is not increased . #% I should like to thank the Commission and the Spanish presidency for being here at this most important debate here today . #% These firms knew the consequences and they should be held accountable for the complete and total cost of cleaning up the damage that they have caused wherever possible . #% If we develop this operational capacity through the Petersberg Tasks , if we develop more coherence in aid and foreign policy , how can we then adopt more coherent policies in international fora ? #% Ireland may therefore have to withdraw from Sfor because a UN mandate will not now exist if this veto persists . #% Ireland is particularly well placed to improve relations with our American friends and I hope that the Irish presidency will further strengthen and deepen relations between the Eruopean Union and the United States . #% Now that is also a terrible plight for us in Europe , where people require eggs to eat . #% Because of the current reform process in the sugar sector , it is time for all the governments concerned , all the relevant Commission directorates and the commercial sector to act and seriously re-examine the possibility of developing a sugar-based bio-ethanol industry . #% Going organic has been a logical development for many of them . #% We want to ensure that this is done . #% Commissioner , do not listen to bad advice . #% If it is only a matter of time before countries are dragged before the ECJ for non-compliance or non-transposition of a particular regulation , this brings into disrepute legislation passed through this House . #% On the Cañete report , there is cause for satisfaction . #% We need a UN peacekeeping force at least 20 000 strong on the ground in Darfur if we are going to stop it . #% Mistakes have been made in dealing with this evolving problem by successive governments . #% While I welcome the recent undertaking by Monsanto not to commercialise the ` seed termination technology ' , this matter is far too serious to leave to those who are directly involved and who would have acted otherwise in the absence of consumer vigilance . #% Public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector , and the European Union could be left covering the highest or uninsurable risks , which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems . #% Mr Needle said one in four people had partaken of complementary medicine and seen the benefits of disciplines such as shiatsu or - as in the case of my own mother where conventional medicine failed - received great relief from acupuncture . #% The forces based in Iraq are sadly contending with daily acts of sabotage and loss of life . #% The European Parliament must make it clear that we will not give our assent to any accession unless and until there is fundamental institutional reform . #% I congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report . #% This is not just my view : the litany of management blunders and serious technical defects is a matter of public record , which has been exposed , despite efforts to keep it secret . #% However we must find a system that will allow the countries concerned and the Commission to monitor fishing agreements effectively and ensure that there is no over-exploitation of the limited resources . #% But the negotiations must also reflect Member States ' needs in light of the consolidation efforts under way in many countries , including Ireland . #% Mr President , I am grateful for the support I had in producing this report . #% Mr President , this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in Europe under the protection of the Working Time Directive , allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods . #% The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland . #% People in Ireland have the opportunity to stop this by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty . #% in writing . - Europe must not fail the Palestinian people yet again . #% A woman who has been abused by a rapist needs help and protection , not more death and destruction . #% The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe . #% in writing . - There is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory . #% Some of the speeches in the Chamber here and some of the lobbying material I have received over the last few weeks on this issue concern protecting small and medium-sized enterprises . #% Of course , as long as these products are cheaper on world markets than they are in the European Union and as long as we have surpluses , there is no possibility that anybody can comply with that order , because it will obviously mean cheaper cereals from outside . #% In less than six years many of our national currencies will disappear from our pockets to be replaced by the Euro . #% It was never going to be easy to satisfy all of the interested parties who have lobbied and worked closely with the Union institutions to bring about amendments to the 1993 directive . #% This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity . #% EU leaders have rightly called on the Palestinian authorities to dismantle terrorist networks run by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and to arrest and prosecute all such suspects and end the armed intifada . #% The enlargement of the Union will strengthen Europe 's voice on the international stage . #% This has been a very controversial and difficult area to legislate in but today we have achieved a victory for common sense . #% Regardless of the circumstances whereby EU funds are disbursed , we can not wash our hands and hope for the best . #% Firstly , with regard to sustainable tourism , obviously tourism is best dealt with where you have human populations . #% It is essential that the voters in the Member States know how serious the Members of this House are about protecting the health of European Union citizens . #% Mr President , in July of this year the House expressed its grave concern over the Belgian dioxin contamination and urged the Commission to act urgently to address the whole issue of food safety . #% In my opinion the Commission and the Council have not yet addressed this issue to a sufficient extent . #% I will not support proposed amendments that would change this constructive report by introducing yet another human rights abuse -- abortion -- into the already abusive situation of war . #% Secondly , on 19 October 2002 , the Irish people approved the provisions of the Treaty of Nice , which ensure that EU enlargement can take place within an agreed timeframe . #% An IGC is very important as institutional reform must take place before the practical process of enlargement can succeed and much work needs to be done to prepare EU Institutions for this intergovernmental phase . #% Are we willing to accept the scenario of uncertainty regarding the food we feed our children , in the light of food safety scares such as mad cow disease , CJD , or avian influenza ? #% This freedom is enshrined in the legal right upon which the basis of the European Union is founded . #% I agree with Mr Donnelly that the convergence achieved is a powerful recognition of what political will and shared political will can bring about . #% I am happy to be one of the sponsors of Sara Méndez and her lost child . #% I would now ask the Council to consider such cases in its delegations of justice ministers in Dublin at the end of this month . #% The fact that we are projecting to spend more money on rural Europe , together with the fact that the number of people involved in agriculture is decreasing , ensures that for the next seven years there is a minimum standard of living guaranteed to people involved in agriculture . #% I welcome the outcome of the conciliation talks and I should particularly like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Corbey , for her excellent work and understanding of the issues . #% I really think we need to know where we are going . #% Farmers should take heart that this Parliament understands their concerns . #% To run through this as if all hell will fall on us unless we finish by 12 noon does not do justice to the statement that has been made by President Santer . #% What we are asking for in Parliament here , in the second reading of the Trakatellis , report is a continuation of that relationship with the European citizen , a continuation of the confidence that the European citizens have in us to deliver for them in real terms . #% The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process . #% This seems to say that when you enter another European country a cure of some description happens and if I was to live in another part of Europe I would have to go through the same process again . #% Mr President , firstly let me say to my colleague and friend , Ms McKenna , that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with . #% Over-regulation , however , leads to unnecessary stifling of the sector , resulting in a lack of variety , and ignores the indigenous range of high-quality regional and national food products . #% In short , and in conclusion , we must adopt a practical approach which safeguards biodiversity , while , at the same time , acknowledging the professional and commercial role of farmers . #% 
The Hutus were defeated by the Tutsis and disarmed a year ago and now they seem to be rearmed . #% In particular , I welcome the agreement that was reached on structured cooperation on defence and the positive signals emerging relating to the creation of an EU Foreign Minister and one Commissioner with full voting rights per Member State , and also the budgetary powers of Parliament . #% Unfortunately these hopes were to be cruelly shattered and it is hard to forget that the present Intifada arose directly from the unnecessary and provocative visit by Mr Sharon to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem . #% However , other parts of the report criticise EU environmental and health and food safety requirements . #% The President-in-Office will have the primary responsibility for guiding negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Treaties . #% It was a pleasure and a privilege having you as our President for the last two and half years and for me personally , as someone who supported you unequivocally on the important day at the beginning of your term of Presidency , I am very happy to say that you have succeeded beyond all my hopes and expectations . #% The main reason this is being raised in the European Parliament is to point out the lack of European harmonised standards in the nuclear industry . #% It will introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and will facilitate decision-making in an enlarged Union . #% It is essential that the financing of the new common agricultural policy after 2013 recognises this , and the very least we need is that the budget should be maintained at least at its current level . #% I have heard precious little from him since having presided over the Liberal group he got political asylum in the EPP Group some years ago . #% Ten days of limited , focused , proportionate bombardment stopped the aggression then . #% I also believe we now need a full communication on the impact of EMU on regional policies , particularly in the light of the Council 's decision on the budget , to cut structural fund payments and to create a false relationship between structural funds , deficit criteria and economic convergence . #% One key element that is lacking with regard to the overall structure is the financial support available to cities to undertake the necessary infrastructural work required to meet the demands for capital of culture status . #% Madam President , I recently visited North Korea with Trocaire , an Irish catholic agency , courtesy of my ECU allowance . #% Please , can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen . #% If I am deaf in Ireland , I am deaf in Europe . #% For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development . #% Moreover , Turkey 's duplicity over Cyprus makes it unworthy of membership . #% In respect of the formation of the Commission itself , I should say that you have my group 's full support . #% The reason we wanted this was because in all the discussions we have had on EMU and the single currency , Member States and experts simply have not dealt with the regional issues . #% I am highly critical of the way in which children can be abused for advertising purposes and I strongly hold the view that the rights of children must be respected . #% This is all good progress . #% Coming from Ireland I know that for far too long people spoke of the Northern Ireland conflict as a conflict between Catholics and Protestants , whereas in fact it was a much more nuanced thing than that and there were much more serious issues , including civil rights issues , at the heart of the problem . #% I have to say , however , that progress seems to have considerably slowed down since then . #% That should not be allowed to continue and authorities who fail to enforce the law should themselves be held liable for the environmental damage caused as a result . #% That means , in the simplest terms , that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism . #% Choices will have to be made about key policies which will have major long-term consequences for each of our countries . #% It is also unworkable in its current form . #% I would also question why it is that the Irish presidency is not here today . #% I should also like to agree with my colleagues who say we must have a real energy policy for the European Union . #% Many years later I am disappointed to see yet another presidency having to list as one of its objectives that of finishing the preparations for the establishment of Europol . #% Follow-up again , please . #% Brenda Wilson is a Greater Manchester constituent of mine who is an active campaigner for the Aviation Health Institute , an organisation working internationally to improve air passenger health . #% I congratulate you on the progress you are making to date . #% Provision of information on cancer risks to outdoor workers is not a burden on employers ; it is an investment in a healthy workforce . #% My report calls for improvements in the fight against illegal fishing in several ways . #% For example , if one types in Tiananmen Square in China , one is likely to get an architectural history of the buildings around the square . #% The role of the European Investment Bank in the structuring and operation of the guarantee fund , as currently proposed , is central . #% It will not come as any surprise to you that I fully support the Miguélez Ramos/Kindermann amendment , which is totally consistent with the contents of the report and simply introduces the notion of gender equality in the title . #% Under it , if a candidate country does not meet EU safety standards , it will not be allowed to sell food products in the internal market . #% How cruelly ironic that a country which threw off the shackles of Stalinist dictatorship only 20 years ago should now revert to aping one of the many crimes of that system : the suppression of the right of people to live freely and in peace according to their own sexual identity . #% However , further developments must be implemented if we are to combat the economic crisis effectively . #% The publishing industry is both unhappy and bemused , to say the least , and this is not how we promote the European Union nor how things work in the Member States . #% There are clearly concerns in Ireland , especially in those towns hosting these particular athletes . #% Ironically , these fraudulent companies quote EU law in order to intimidate their targets further . #% It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues . #% We -- and European citizens -- would like to see guarantees that this is where this money is going , rather than taking it at face value . #% I believe VRT is an anti-free market mechanism and one of the reasons why the EU passenger car market has not been functioning well . #% The majority will ultimately win , but those who disagree can make this a better debate , and they should be encouraged to do so and should not be disenfranchised from their position . #% In particular , in order to achieve a better social integration and greater social cohesion , this report urges Member States to create training opportunities specific to groups such as unemployed youth , ethnic minorities , vulnerable women and people with disabilities . #% You have completed a very successful first presidency for Finland but you have done it with a capacity that does enormous credit to the tasks which you addressed . #% There has certainly been no debate in Dáil Éireann . #% We want you to look at the possibility of involving credit card companies and Internet service providers in supporting the blacklisting of sites trading in illegal pornographic content . #% It has already been mentioned that the Conference for Climate Change will be held in Bonn from 16-27 July 2001 . #% This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe , not militarisation . #% As we all know in this House , disability rights feature prominently within the Spanish system . #% Please do not underestimate the potential of the Joint Research Centre , which is itself a scientific centre for policy - a reference centre for policy - and is ideally suited to the role of networking the centres of excellence . #% If , added to that , is the experience of being taken from one jurisdiction to another and denied access to a mother or father - indeed , to grandparents and extended family - then the trauma is magnified . #% Unless there is a price to be paid , those protagonists will not come to the table and will not make a deal . #% Once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has BSE , then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that , then the whole herd should be taken out . #% Firstly , there was the matter of general principle that , in the interests of promoting better , simpler and clearer legislation , the introduction of an unevenly weighted , dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making . #% The fight against this trade , if it is to be effective , must also be sophisticated and international in scope . #% I would like to hear the Commissioner 's views in relation to the importance of highlighting this aspect , which is particularly important in Irish society today . #% Mr President , there is no limit on the curiosity of scientists . #% Last week a key committee in the Irish Parliament also voted to reject this unethical research . #% In view of the slow-down in the US economy and consequently the world economy , it is essential that we , as legislators , do all we can to facilitate business and job creation . #% 
In order to place temporary pilots and aircraft engineers with an airline in Italy , a EUR 400 000 deposit and the establishment of four offices are required . #% If we are convinced that CO2 emissions need to be reduced dramatically , then we have to stop tinkering at the margins of renewable energy and to achieve genuine liberalisation for electricity markets . #% It is what your shareholders want . #% What role does it see for Europol ? #% Of course there are , just like in every other sector -- economic or otherwise -- known to man . #% There is still time for this to be done . #% Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy . #% There is no mention of state terrorism . #% in writing . - I voted for this proposal in recognition of the many volunteers who do invaluable work without the recognition they deserve . #% Article 23 provides for an assessment of the impact of the directive and Parliament will take that seriously . #% As far as aeronautics is concerned , I am glad that there will be some attention to the health of passengers . #% Indeed a major international crime conference in Dublin this week highlighted the very serious difficulties drug squad officers from European countries have in dealing with the Europol drugs unit in the Hague . #% Madam President , I would like to confine my remarks to Alzheimer 's disease . #% As it states in the Convention , `` the family as the fundamental group of society and natural environment for the growth and wellbeing of its members , particularly children , should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance to fully assume its responsibility within the Community '' . #% On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , I would like to the European Commission . #% Given the relatively small size of the area that is Northern Ireland and the border counties , it has touched a large proportion of the population . #% Equally importantly , there should be no ambivalence about this evil . #% I should be quite happy with observer status without speaking rights . #% Mr President , the pregnant mother and her unborn child , mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period , which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society , remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in Europe today . #% There is no doubt that the British Government made very serious mistakes in its handling of the BSE crisis , but after much delay it has now put in place a well funded and scientifically based eradication programme which is working well . #% The new guidelines confuse it with low-dispersal material . #% I am pleased to say that 22 of Parliament 's amendments were accepted in the common position and others have been accepted in subsequent negotiations . #% The Convention recognises that any State has the right to ban imports into its territory of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste . #% The argument has been made that this issue should instead be covered by horizontal legislation . #% Finally , one of the great disappointments of Laeken was the failure to reach agreement on the siting of up to 12 new important EU agencies . #% in writing . - I support this resolution , which calls on the Lithuanian Parliament to reject draft legislation that seeks to punish the ` public promotion of homosexual relations ' with fines . #% However , bearing those points in mind , I would commend this report to the House and my group will be supporting the position of the rapporteur . #% Madam President , I have been indicating for a long time that I wished to speak . #% This year , we have a very different report , in style and in content . #% As a result of the damage to my brain I have been registered as blind with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland . #% I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real . #% There are few more traumatic experiences for children than to be the subject of disputes between parents . #% Frankly , the EU is not punching its weight in research , although some Member States are very good . #% Today ' s debate is a further positive step on this important road ensuring that animal feed available to farmers is of the highest quality . #% There is a difference between animals that are going for slaughter and animals that are continuing their journey , and there is a difference between cattle , sheep and pigs . #% The Fianna Fail delegation in the European Parliament voted in favour of the Supplementary Budget to finance the `` mad cow '' eradication programme , and the associated resolution - but not without serious reserves . #% I am very happy indeed that Mr Schnellhardt has said , on behalf of my group , that we will be supporting Mr Pimenta 's report . #% Nevertheless , he was not here in the last Parliament and when he has been here as long as I have he will learn to have a little bit more patience . #% Africa itself is one of the centres of the best footballers in the world . #% Madam President , I call on the Irish Government to immediately apply for natural disaster aid relief under the European Solidarity Fund . #% But I want to request that the Swiebel report be postponed to a later date . #% I would also like to remind the European Commission that before the recent economic success in Ireland , the Irish people were required to make major sacrifices so as to guarantee that economic growth could take place . #% The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is : Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime ? #% As previous speakers on this issue have indicated , the individual Member States have not implemented the criteria properly . #% I believe that it is necessary to define the application of the CFP in a clear and consistent manner , setting out a coherent system of regionalisation . #% The task of Lisbon has been correctly identified by you , Prime Minister , and by President Prodi as no less than shifting European policy towards a new practice , towards a new paradigm . #% I have one difficulty which is not exactly related to this , but I would appreciate a response from the Commissioner as to what the Commission will do about it . #% There is no doubt that all the evidence of history indicates that we have to regulate the funding of political parties . #% We should not be involved with arms in the first place , to be honest . #% The Irish people have spoken . #% I can only hope that the Commission and the Spanish presidency acting together will begin to tackle this very important matter in the months ahead . #% Mr President , it has indeed been a long , hard road . #% in writing . - I condemn today 's vote , which narrowly defeated the objection to a misleading health claim by a major manufacturer of baby milk . #% Enactment of legislation under Article 23 has raised such concerns . #% In Ireland this drop is somewhere around 19 % with livestock farmers suffering even greater reductions in income . #% Therefore , every possible effort must be made to destroy it and also the related crime of money-laundering . #% The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money , which I think he said were largely unrecognised . #% I should like to make a few technical remarks about the report . #% It is essential that we simplify and modify the VAT collection system to guarantee that success . #% This is as I have said a vital agreement for the new South African democracy , but it is also the basis of a partnership of equals , one which will enhance both sides economically as well as strategically . #% But the important point is that this is a subsidiarity issue and we must give no indication that it is otherwise . #% It is unacceptable that we sit back here in the European Union and do nothing about it . #% Indeed if she was misrepresented or misreported in the newspapers I would suggest that , on the issue of substance on which she was actually quoted , she should withdraw or substantiate . #% If we were more careful in the way we live and the materials we use , just as Mr Marset Campos said very clearly , we could eliminate this type of problem . #% Mr Wojciechowski has done his bit and he can not be blamed in any way for any delay . #% It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% 
As a representative of an Objective 1 region in the north and west of Ireland , I am very conscious of the benefit of every single euro invested in an effort to redress the economic and socio-economic imbalance in the Union . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your work and , above all , thanks to my colleague Mr Bowis for his excellent report . #% The financial sector is under-taxed . #% We need to listen to that child as mothers do , and to help them find a way to reconcile home and work to the benefit of both . #% However , we must be mindful of encroaching too much on European citizens as there are obvious personal privacy issues with such technology . #% Mr President , this proposal by Mr Jarzembowski seeks to achieve two things : a uniform approach to what is a global problem , and also a solution to the conflict with the United States . #% I believe it is wrong to draw parallels or to say all processes are exactly the same . #% Hence I welcome the resistance at last Friday 's Council of Ministers meeting to a further surrender of the national veto . #% We must not allow our industry in the European Union to place its operators at any further disadvantage . #% I would also like to thank the Commissioner for some of the hints she has given us on what she hopes to achieve in the coming year with regard to these guidelines and strategies . #% Since my appointment as Mediator for Abducted Children , I have learned a great deal and much of what I have learned has sickened me . #% The Council is trying to wriggle out of its duty here . #% Our inaction will cost lives . #% It requires you to bring the other actors together to ensure we have a success . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Dell ` Alba 's report and its recognition that the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund are an innovative means of consolidating the peace process . #% Hopefully , again it is only a suspect case and will remain so . #% The European Parliament resolution further calls on the EU countries which are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011 and calls on the EU Member States to ratify and implement the convention and recommendation quickly . #% This will be another interim COP , COP 12-MOP 2 if you like , but it is very important , as this is the first meeting on sub-Saharan Africa . #% Madam President , I congratulate the rapporteur and I welcome the Commission proposal for the revision of the current rules concerning recognition of non-EU seafarers . #% Mr President , I want to say firstly to the President of the Commission that my group will study the detail of what he has proposed to us here this evening . #% I believe that we should proceed on the basis that we will use the Euro from the day that the currency rates are fixed . #% Mr President , I share the general disappointment at the failure of the Amsterdam Treaty to take on board the business it was supposed to discuss , which was the formation of an energy chapter . #% The changes introduced by this House have improved the proposal , and Mr Schlyter 's report is both balanced and objective . #% What I really want to know is whether the Commissioners attend these meetings in their own private capacity or whether they are representing the Commission . #% The development of high-speed trains has to be welcomed ; it should not be stopped . #% But from what you have said , that is not the case . #% Much of the debate , therefore , about opening up rail links and so forth to some extent goes over our heads . #% Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether there is anything that the Commission can do to encourage the removal of the older animals from the national herd ? #% Ireland has had 30 years of terror , which effectively ended in stalemate . #% Coordination within Commission departments and Member State government departments encompassing an integrated approach is key . #% We in the UK know the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak and how it brought both agriculture and tourism to their knees . #% We acknowledge the progress which has been made to date by Albania in reforming its economy and in seeking to move towards a multi-party democracy . #% . Because of the rejection of all amendments which would have prevented European illegal fishing in the waters of Western Sahara I have voted against this resolution . #% Let me hasten to add that I am not one of those people who say that all governments are wrong and all opposition groups or all non-governmental groups are right . #% Efforts can only go so far while China , a deciding member , continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms . #% Human rights , labour and environmental standards and tax governance must guide EU negotiations with developing countries . #% This is the moment to draw a line and say to the Court of Auditors - whom my group holds in very high esteem - that we have separate functions : they audit and we do the politics . #% In this decade we have already lost 25 % of people engaged in agriculture and incomes have dropped by around 20 % . #% I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups . #% Likewise , is the presidency prepared to promote this priority in the Council . #% This report includes a proposal calling on European Union airlines to inform passengers of the percentage degree seat pitch available to passengers travelling in economy class . #% The new committee will establish greater transparency , implement Community policies more coherently , reduce bureaucracy and minimise costs . #% The proposals put forward are unrealistic and impractical . #% I thank the rapporteur for all his cooperation and this balanced report , which I commend to the House . #% To move away from that argument back to today : when we think of the lessons of 20 years , in Ukraine and Belarus and in other parts of Europe there are still children being born with birth defects . #% It is not only in our interest in Ireland that we ratify the Nice Treaty , it is in the interests of all the accession states who want to rejoin the European family . #% We have to know what the cost and effect , the damage or the benefit will be to those who fly , be it as a hobby , on business or for any other reason . #% The European fight against trafficking is a major crime issue but it is also a fundamental matter of women 's rights . #% This regulation constitutes an important framework which needs to be developed upon by the respective Member States . #% Let us act now and keep energy security at the top of the political agenda in peacetime . #% It is a net reduction in emissions we want globally , not just exporting the problem from the West to the less developed regions . #% Let me briefly turn to two important issues mentioned by the President-in-Office , Mr Spring : enlargement and institutional reform . #% Enlargement to welcome ten new States and tens of millions of new European citizens into the EU is both a bold gesture and the accomplishment of our true European destiny . #% I was talking to someone a few days ago who had been to one of these illegal race tracks in Spain , where they found nine greyhounds from Ireland racing on a course in appalling conditions . #% That is why I would ask you to remember - at future Council meetings , or when people from other countries say we must shelve this whole agricultural-rural issue - that there is a direct link between agriculture and rural development which can not be broken . #% Mr President , right at the outset I salute the superb courage of the McCartney family . #% Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go . #% This happens for a variety of reasons , not least because they are the ones who give birth . #% I am not raising this subject with the intention of embarrassing the British Government in any way , but I am extremely concerned for European farmers , for the British farmers who are bearing the brunt of the crisis at the present time , and , in particular , I am concerned for farmers in Ireland . #% I am glad to say , the Labour commissioner , Bruce Millan , spotted this and was very clear about the fact that these areas could not possibly qualify for European Objective 2 under economic social cohesion need areas . #% I am convinced that the introduction of the new procedure would also be in the interests of the intended beneficiaries of our financial instruments . #% Under no circumstances can the cohesion process for existing less-developed regions be jeopardized , nor should there be any link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund . #% I have to ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken Asia is producing and exporting to Europe . #% I would urge , as others have urged , that the new rapid reaction force should not have available to it these types of weapons . #% Article 1.4 in annex 3 regulates which persons or bodies within this House may request of the Commission access to confidential documents . #% If the Commission calls it an EU delegation , then the three EU parties who are present should be treated equally . #% 
I think of my own country in this context , with its poor road , rail and inland waterway infrastructure . #% That is one area of the fisheries sector where there is the odd reference , here and there , among the plethora of EU legislation , but no Community rules and regulations that specifically cater for the sector . #% I believe it is important to make the best possible use of these opportunities . #% The European research area is of course important . #% We can not remain immune to the fact that the coming generation of young people is also fascinated and involved with the electronic media and perhaps need to have brought home to them again and again by their elders and betters the genuine pleasures of the printed word and the need to protect it , albeit with such small programmes as this . #% At the moment only 2.5 % is spent in Africa in this area and that is mainly in Morocco and South Africa , and none in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa as such . #% But even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility . #% There are so many problems that they feel it is out of their hands . #% My Group supports the proposal and will vote against most of the amendments proposed , especially against those amendments that in our opinion send the wrong political signal by watering down the deficit criteria essential to a credible currency . #% A recent survey of Irish consumers , for example , revealed that just one in five people has confidence in food imported from outside the European Union . #% The evidence is extremely shaky in this area . #% The UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Burma has expressed very deep concern about the recent reports that members of the NLD continue to be victims of arbitrary arrests and various forms of restriction . #% There are people making huge amounts of money by dealing in arms , by ensuring that countries and people can actually get arms from the arms suppliers . #% However , that said and giving credit where credit is due , we must also recognise that there are a lot of deficiencies within the common fisheries policy . #% Clearly , the Commission has been remiss in assessing the damage both to the shipping and airline business resulting from the abolition of duty-free : its effect on costs and fares and above all , in the regions , its effect on employment . #% While we should acknowledge the advances made by the European aviation industry 's voluntary initiative , the Emissions Containment Policy , with EU air traffic movements set to double by 2020 over the 2003 level , the real question is whether , on the basis of the polluter pays principle , this voluntary initiative will be adequate to counteract rising emissions from air transport . #% That family 's case had been reported in the national media , exposing the lack of services for their own children and children in general . #% We are now into a new period -- an unprecedented revolution in technology , in the age structure of our population , and in the globalisation of capital , where there is a growing need to create a transnational democracy that is capable of effective governance of those new phenomena . #% Mr President , who can forget the tragic images of Burundi , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Bosnia-Herzegovina and more recently , Kosovo that are still fresh in our minds . #% By the middle of next year we will , in effect , have European monetary union for perhaps 80 % of the entire economy of our 15 countries and we should proceed on that basis . #% My last point is that , in setting up any working groups or expert groups concerning better lawmaking , it is essential to get the practitioners of politics involved -- not just technocrats or parliamentary draftsmen , but politicians themselves who can understand how this must be sold to the public and enforced at a local level . #% We share common values . #% They are playing an invaluable role in creating peace and stability . #% Mr President , despite the very welcome efforts of the Commission and indeed of the United Nations , it is difficult to display optimism in this dark period . #% There is no doubt in my mind that the same individuals involved in this trade are also involved in drugs and other such activities . #% The truth is that they are being intimidated and are afraid to come forward : such is the hold of the provisional IRA on the people in this area . #% I especially welcome the fact that the United Kingdom will have its referendum and that the ordinary European citizens in the United Kingdom will not be robbed of their right to pass their judgement on this momentous decision . #% Member States must ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies will provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently . #% The only way this can be

' #% Though the number of people suffering from HIV has stabilised in recent years in Europe , the problem of AIDS is still a very real one particularly in the more deprived and disadvantaged urban areas and of course , within the African continent . #% Is there any further pressure that the Council and the European Union would consider putting on the Iraqi authorities in an effort at least to get information as to how many of these people are alive , who they are , what is the state of their health , when they are going to be released and , indeed , how many have died . #% I state categorically that even today the topic of this report is on websites in Ireland and is being used by the `` no to Nice '' campaign to beat around the ears those like myself who would be part of the `` yes '' campaign in relation to the Nice Treaty . #% To do so denies the fact that they cause damage . #% Under the proposal , key information contained in the court files in the Member States would be copied , using a standard form , to a centralised database for on-line access by interested parties . #% This report , along with his colleagues ' reports , calls for a rejection of the Council text . #% Forty-four are children while 23 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are detained in retaliation for the capture of Gilad Shalit . #% Due to these reasons , we can not support the Commission 's modified proposal , which would again only raise the financial costs and technical difficulties and would be entirely inadequate to the aim of added value in security . #% This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities . #% I regret that one or two Commissioners did not shoulder their responsibilities but I regret that so many good people , including the President Mr Santer , who have done so much important work and achieved so much success have appeared in the eyes of Europe to be discredited when in fact they are people of honour who have done a good job . #% Whatever side of the political divide we come from , we all agree that more needs to be done to achieve a more effective Europe-wide employment strategy . #% These vary considerably throughout the Union . #% Here we are trying to protect the individuality of products and the uniqueness of local ingredients . #% This is an accumulation of an ineffective and inefficient system over years . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people , and secondly , in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in its attempt to create uncertainty and instability , not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States . #% A recent evaluation of the EU product licensing procedures observed , and I quote , `` significant concern in the veterinary sector about the decreased availability of established medicinal products for food-producing animals as a result of the introduction of the MRL requirements .

Mr President , the Agenda 2000 negotiations now under way are among the most difficult which the European Union has faced as an institution and political entity since the foundation of the European Economic Community . #% Has the Commission agreed that this is not a conflict of interest ? #% The Commission 's proposal to launch a debate on MSY in advance of agreement by the Council and Parliament simply is not on . #% I welcome the emphasis on an integrated policy approach and on the external impact of EU policy on sustainable resources . #% That would result in a significant amount of pressure on national governments . #% Finally , I would suggest that the Commission needs urgently to take on board the suspicions regarding price-fixing with regard to roaming mobile telephone calls . #% In essence what this means is that the countries , including Latvia , Lithuania , Slovakia , Bulgaria , Romania and Malta , will now open negotiations on membership of the European Union in March of next year . #% However , you can look at all the models that you wish and analyse all the processes that have been put in place but the only way of increasing employment that has been successful is the reduction of labour costs . #% The Amsterdam Treaty was defective in this regard . #% Secondly , with regard to the question of utilizing structural funds in the way that has been suggested , yesterday we had the Commission reporting on the abolition of duty-free , saying that it would allow for state subsidy for certain regional transport sectors to ensure that they were not at a disadvantage . #% In Ireland we need more regionalization and less centralization . #% Commissioner , it only takes one accident over a densely-populated area like Belgium and Luxembourg to have lethal results when radioactive material is transported - I should not have to remind you of that . #% I support these measures and encourage more Member State cooperation , which will allow greater mobility for patients and experts to serve you , the citizen . #% This company is also in serious difficulty . #% The Commission is proposing to extend the MAGP by one more year in order to debate fleet policy in the context of the Green Paper . #% If rural society is not economically and socially attractive to women it will be impossible to retain living and vibrant rural communities . #% There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids . #% That is something I never expected to see in my country . #% The Member States should make every effort to have this matter included in the Assembly 's agenda . #% Arrangements for the Isle of Man and similar territories within the United Kingdom are well catered for and are not presenting any difficulties , and have been well catered for since accession in 1973 . #% I , like many people , am very fond of it . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Mr President , I should like to say ` well done ' to the rapporteur : he has certainly shown a steady hand . #% I would hope that the Commission will take this on board . #% I welcome the IOC 's announcement that heavy penalties will be imposed on sportsmen and women caught using drugs in Sydney this month and in the future . #% It is incumbent on us to ensure that some financial support would be available under these programmes , either at European or national level . #% No way can you have those who perpetrate the crime being given equal treatment with the victim . #% We reject the view that according any person whose extradition is sought their rights under law is tantamount to an implicit or explicit support of terrorism . #% Sometimes the sheepmeat regime is severely criticized because of the cost per kilo of meat produced . #% I am therefore in favour of approving the common position on the directive as it is , without further amendments . #% Perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh . #% Therefore , anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy , for whatever reason , is being unrealistic . #% We respect , and must respect , the three institutions and the role that they have to play . #% In West Dublin , in my own constituency and in the inner city the drugs crisis and heroin addiction have reached epidemic proportions . #% At this point we know that the new countries will come in - at the most optimistic estimate - with something like 30 % of the GDP of existing Members . #% This Parliament and the European institutions need no explanation about the importance of stability for mediumterm policy . #% Both Shell and BP are investing massively in renewable energy technologies . #% What is it saying about the Anglo-French beef issue ? #% We have no choice , Mr Prodi . #% I agree with Mr Bowis . #% If Mr Cohn-Bendit has passion in abundance at the moment , perhaps he would direct some of it to his Green colleagues from my country who are trying to convince the electorate that they should vote against the Treaty of Nice . #% Yes , people blame the Sudanese Government , and it is to blame . #% Some people speak of the pensions time bomb and , given some of the figures that I have seen estimating the gap between what we currently put aside for both public and private pension provision and the resources we will need to ensure adequate pension provision for the next forty years , that gap is huge . #% This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated . #% All I know is that there are no easy solutions and we can not wave a magic wand . #% There is an assumption that all Member States should ultimately reach the same recovery and recycling rates , irrespective of size , geography or infrastructure . #% I condemn utterly the statements by Prime Minister Berlusconi . #% Can we oblige those countries to live up to their obligations under the Single European Act ? #% The tragic events that took place in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence . #% The proposals are encouraging , but it is far from clear how they will be implemented and funded . #% They are storing up resentment and even hatred among the people in the Middle East and the Islamic nations throughout the world . #% It need not necessarily impose a major burden on the European Union budget . #% The risk that attempts may be made to counterfeit the euro currency when it begins to circulate in the form of coins and notes is very high . #% The reason I raise this issue is that a number of Commissioners - Monti , Liikanen , Solbes Mira , Verheugen , Vitorino and Bolkestein - have all in the past attended Bilderberg meetings . #% Everybody has problems in the European Union of one type or the other and no-one should try to make or take advantage of the other 's problem . #% What strikes me is that there is no reference to EU participation . #% In supporting the report before Parliament , it is to the credit , I believe , of the Commission that regulations were quickly put in place to address both the eradication of BSE and , more importantly , measures to prevent a recurrence . #% A huge number of jobs are involved and maintaining duty-free has particular relevance for regional development . #% I believe the Commission has lost control of the Common Fisheries Policy and is simply becoming the poodle of the Spanish Government and the industry in Spain . #% There is no doubt that the operation of the internal market has been a success , particularly over the last ten years , and from an Irish perspective economic success in our country could simply not have been achieved if we were not a Member of the Union . #% Ireland and Europe have to adopt immigration policies based on full respect for human rights as set out in international conventions , such as the Geneva Convention . #% Citizens have paid twice , with costs of a taxpayer bailout followed by the pain of recession and spending cuts . #% This presents us with two challenges . #% What is interesting as well as that the chairman , Ray MacSharry is a former European Commissioner for Agriculture and he is still refusing to acknowledge the fact that Coillte is a public entity and that it is not entitled to such payments . #% I wonder , Minister , if that means that you will be publicly putting pressure on Britain , Sweden and Finland , among others , to cease selling arms to places like Indonesia where they have been used in genocide campaigns against the East Timorese . #% On balance I feel we must accept it and support your team . #% There is a need for a new approach to foreign policy and indeed not only to foreign and development policy , but in all aspects of our dealings with third countries . #% 
It is a sector with considerable potential but like any other business it needs some reasonable stability in terms of its business conditions . #% It is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the Commission in all Member States and in the eyes of each national electorate . #% The second green rate is for direct income support for farmers such as premium payments . #% That can only be achieved if we invest in the people themselves . #% matters of marital or family status #% It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy . #% Perhaps if Members listened to the debate they might contribute more light than heat . #% It has been reported that Israel is now demanding that the European Union stop giving financial assistance to Human Rights Organisations operating in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories . #% The figures agreed will permit Ireland to increase emissions only by 13 per cent relative to 1990 figures . #% Mr President , the Council proposals liberalizing airport groundhandling services could actually have very serious consequences for jobs and safety at the airport in my own constituency , Dublin , and indeed at other major airports throughout Europe , as has been mentioned by other speakers . #% Over 40 % of all the people employed in this sector are graduates with third-level education . #% This has to be top priority because too many fish that are taken aboard vessels are discards - and then it is much too late . #% This is what I want to concentrate on . #% I would like the Commissioner here tonight to confirm that this cooperation is working to the maximum and as well as he would wish . #% So they face the dual interest which you have delineated . #% We must not only appreciate and preserve local specialities but also the farmers ' markets at which they are still sometimes locally sold . #% It also shows that the burden of over-regulation , which often tarnishes the image of the EU , is often not the fault of any EU institution but of the Member State itself . #% Although the Maltese authorities have introduced VAT , much new legislation is still required to bring Maltese law into line with the EU situation . #% I defend what you have done . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply and I welcome the proposal to prepare a new regulation . #% President-in-Office , too much of what we want to say is lost in Jesuitical sophistry in our text . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I would like to begin by congratulating you and also by congratulating the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government on the excellent conduct of Ireland 's six-month presidency of the Union . #% The proposal to use a single market legal base and also impose additional bans in the annex is a blunt instrument that industry , the Commission and the Council can not accept . #% We must now ensure that those who served the sugar industry loyally for many years receive equitable compensation . #% The scarce development resources must be used in the most effective and efficient manner . #% Why should a business have to apply to join a local chamber of commerce , only to be told there is a five-year waiting list ? #% Regrettably the reason is patently obvious : commercial interests are dictating the policy towards China in both the United States and many European Member States . #% Unfortunately on Alzheimer 's disease it does no more than finance research and this is just not good enough . #% Their livelihoods were endangered . #% It is vital , as Mrs Wallis , has said , that the consumer is aware and informed of this option . #% The International Renewable Energy Agency aims to become a centre of excellence for renewable energy , which will enable it to help governments harness renewable energy sources , to disseminate know-how and best practice , and to provide training in this field . #% On one hand it disingenuously accepts a Protocol apparently accepting Cyprus , but at the same time issues a declaration disavowing any such recognition . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party I wish to address the report by Mr Ruffolo . #% If Member State governments will not provide this , we should reduce the amount of money they receive under the Socrates programme and other education programmes . #% This communication builds on the Giovannini report of November 2001 , which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union . #% I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship . #% In recent weeks the Israeli foreign minister and the Palestinian leader have visited Parliament . #% The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , the International Commission of Jurists and , last night , US Congressmen have all expressed their worries over the case . #% I take particular exception to his comment that people who backed Turkey 's accession are ` the adversaries of the European Union ' . #% She is in a secure psychiatric mother and baby unit in England , and it seems to me that if the decent English people who fought hard for the release of Louise Woodward were to consider the inequity of the imprisonment of this young woman on very flimsy evidence , they would call on their government for her release . #% To date , many of the actions taken to deal with BSE have been carried out on a unilateral basis by Members using national measures . #% It is exceedingly urgent . #% As has been stated and restated time and time again , forums such as the NSRAC were established in order to canvass and to utilise the wide body of expertise and opinion among people on the ground , people on the coalface , people who know the industry and to counteract the perception that Brussels or Strasbourg make policies which are often seen as ` about you , without you ' . #% Will the Council today , with the support of my own country , Ireland , make GMOs exempt from the Aarhus Convention ? #% Parliament needs to reject this and as a member of the British Parliament I will be voting against it in my own Parliament . #% Like ALTENER , SAVE II is one of those programmes . #% I think it is very timely . #% The Finnish Government has certainly started this process . #% However , we still have enormous developmental and structural needs . #% Since then , however , there has been major regression tempered only by the recession which has hit most of our countries . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office , does he see any role now for Thiérry Larsson who made such a success of the Oslo peace agreement ? #% The Colombian authorities have made numerous serious prejudicial comments which cast doubts on the possibility of the trial being fair . #% What assurances can the European Central Bank give that these matters will be scrutinised with the utmost vigour and with appropriate sanctions ? #% What is clear is that the political will is not there . #% According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , world sugar consumption in 2004-2005 was 144.8 million tonnes , with production at only 149 million tonnes . #% That is a tragedy , considering that it happened in their own constituency . #% This whole revolutionary area - as I , being a former teacher , know - has the potential to combat digital illiteracy . #% Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi . #% They perform a very important role in the social life of villages and rural communities , promoting a whole range of activities and participating in local associations . #% We have to look at these issues and decide that these countries should not be allowed to operate in this way . #% Outstanding differences of opinion need to be ironed out in a committed and systematic way to break the remaining deadlock . #% But structures have evolved to pressure them and monitor their activities ; to ensure that they were disarming and completely committed to politics . #% Our irresponsible and profligate use of energy , with its consequential emissions of C02 and other environmental hazards must stop . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the amount of work he has put into this , indeed into all issues that come before the Committee on Fisheries . #% Mr President , if the overall social human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured , then the standards laid down by the EU 's recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% That starts , in my view , with good , clear drafting of laws , high-quality impact assessments and effective , comprehensive and transparent stakeholder consultation . #% 
This was very effective in the past - in 1992 , for instance , because of the threat of aid cuts the President agreed to a multiparty system - so perhaps we could add the GUE Group amendment as an addendum . #% That is why many of the measures in SAVE II are aimed at households - better design of houses , more economical household appliances and effective education programmes . #% While health is a Member State competence , the European Community can add value and complement the activities of Member States through urgently needed coordination and collation of best practice models so that we can learn from each other and create centres of excellence . #% Finally , on the matter of consumer confidence , I am very wary of the notion in the report that the Commission should promote consumer confidence in aquaculture . #% President al-Bashir continues to oppose Phase 3 of the present UN Plan which allows the AU mission to be bolstered by more than 20 000 UN peacekeeping troops . #% We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future . #% The conditions agreed within the international dolphin conservation programme for the use of purse seines which commonly will apply provisionally within the Community incorporate into this regulation a revision of mesh size for two species of spotted dogfish . #% Celtic Tiger Ireland should be a success story for all the Irish people , and yet we remain one of the most unequal societies not just in the EU but in fact globally . #% However , the most crucial ingredient in tackling this fraud is political will . #% The Swedish government has made it clear that it intends to prioritise what is known as the 3 Es during its presidency of the Union , and this relates to addressing the key problems of enlargement of the Union , employment matters and promoting environmental issues . #% I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from ? #% Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before . #% On your behalf I extend my best wishes to her . #% While I object to paying such high rates of VRT in a so-called single market , I recognise that VRT is a once-off tax capitalised in the value of cars . #% There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight . #% The fact that the European Union is the world 's principal donor of humanitarian aid , is neither known nor understood by many of our citizens . #% I believe the report makes a balanced attempt to answer that difficult political question . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the British Prime Minister to the European Parliament . #% We have done something serious about dealing with the criminals on the one hand and with our approach to immigration on the other . #% The publication of the Commission White Paper on food safety and the proposed establishment of a European Food Authority marks a new era in food production . #% In some cases they were not paid at all , in some cases only half the normal rate . #% So , over the next ten years - as my colleague has said - the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge , information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about . #% It is imperative that the European Union guarantees that the benefits of new information technologies are incorporated across all sectors of European industry . #% Instead , our priority should be to improve the situation of asylum-seekers in the Member States . #% I agree with the deal , I think it is a good deal in general and better than the previous deal , but there are still requirements for further clarity on it . #% My understanding is that the spring summit instructed the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a framework for services of a general interest by the end of this year . #% There has been a general breakdown in the computer network and it lasted five minutes due to defective hardware . #% In Irish one would say , which means be ready , be vigilant . #% Up until August 2003 , 92 women in Ireland were killed over the previous 92 months : one woman per month on average dies in Ireland as a result of so-called domestic disputes . #% Bearing in mind the measures and plans aimed at better regulation at European level , it is to be hoped that the procedure used for debating data retention will not become the rule ' , to quote directly from the report to Parliament . #% That does not mean that the women become the primary carers and the rest of the activities in those units is carried out by the men . #% The fields concerned are created not only by high voltage lines and broadcasting transmitters but by ordinary household appliances that we are all in regular contact with , such as mobile phones and television screens . #% Measures such as this are crucial in order to give authorities the tools and common purpose they need to tackle this Europe-wide problem . #% Thirdly , you need to create institutions which respect those differences , and the fourth element is working together in the common interest . #% Mr President , I rise to support Mr Cornelissen , Mrs Ewing and Mr Miller . #% Temperature rises have already been noted . #% We have avoided over-regulation and excessive bureaucracy and come forward with a piece of legislation that is reasonable and workable and which protects workers . #% We are determined , after years of foot-dragging by the previous Conservative Government - Mrs Jackson 's party - to meet our requirements in the UK , in good faith , to follow the proper legal and proper consultation to ensure this directive is complied with . #% The only way we can get that is through aggressive diplomacy . #% This seems an extraordinary amount of fish . #% There is one overriding and general concern , the sense that people are losing control of their government and their lives . #% Legislators must not be afraid to state harsh realities when looking at potential impacts . #% He said no small group of countries should be able to block decisions , and this is so . #% He replied that he could not discuss that because he was not yet the President and he did not know who the other nominees were going to be . #% Mr President , I welcome the manner in which the representatives of the newly-elected UK Government have been received by the European Council . #% In addition to cooperating with the World Health Organisation , we can put in place preparatory plans for dealing with any potential outbreaks . #% We will have to show the same determination as in the past in order to find constructive answers . #% If I choose to spend 10 hours on a beach on Saturday or Sunday , or 10 hours in the garden at 80 degrees exposed to the sun , or on the golf course in very hot sunshine , all the health authorities would say that it was far too long . #% They are always available and always very supportive . #% We may not achieve those with the proposals contained in this report . #% We should ensure that the rules and regulations that we set down guarantee that those innovators have those protections and have those rights . #% I join with those who have praised the Taoiseach and his team today for the successful conclusion of the constitutional negotiations , in particular the retention of the broad framework , values , objectives and citizens ' rights which the European Convention had negotiated . #% At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security . #% President-in-Office , your challenge is to ensure that the debate on the Constitution is concluded over the next six months ; this is a difficult task , but let me wish you every success in this particularly historic task . #% How can we have a free market when there are three companies with EUR 10 billion or more at their disposal to buy up other companies ? #% -- Mr President , I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on what has been an appalling tragedy in north-western Pakistan , Afghanistan , India and predominantly the Kashmir region . #% Mr President , the Helsinki Summit of EU leaders has been quite accurately billed as the European Union 's enlargement Summit , and there can be no doubt that this European Council meeting has lived up to this particular expectation . #% Could you also address the implications of this for the cross-border healthcare package which is currently under discussion ? #% Mr President , since we last met , a Member State of this Union , the Republic of Ireland , has been shamefully harbouring three convicted international terrorists . #% So it is quite ridiculous for Members in this House to argue that this inquiry should not proceed . #% We need simple , better-focused legislation which is easier to enforce . #% The EU has a responsibility to make Darfur an ongoing priority for the UN . #% Could I ask the President-in-Office whether he would be willing to bring forward an initiative at Council level calling on the Commission to put in place a new poverty programme that will utilise the best of the past but to make it a real programme , not just experts exchanging ideas , or meetings taking place in exotic parts of the Union . #% Many are far more interested in their identity as , for instance , fans of a football club or a particular pop star . #% We appreciate that the economic development of eastern Europe will in the longer term bring economic advantages for all of us . #% If amendments are necessary in the light of new developments , no doubt the Commission will come back with further proposals and I am quite certain that the Committee and Parliament will respond expeditiously . #% 
We talk a lot about the sustainability of European agriculture . #% Mr President , there is concern surrounding the recent agreement reached on the reform of the common agricultural policy : certain agricultural changes could come about as a result of the World Trade Organisation talks . #% However , we have to be careful to tread very softly with regard to constitutional rights and fundamental freedoms . #% In good faith , I would request Commissioner Kyprianou , who is in the House today representing the Commission , to respond on behalf of the Commission to the serious concerns that have been generated by the text of Tuesday night 's declaration . #% The single greatest challenge facing the European Union is to prepare for the enlargement process with the accession of six new countries to the Union by the year 2004-2005 . #% Through their resolution in the UN Ireland and Sweden have taken the initiative in accordance with the Canberra Commission proposal for a nuclear weapon-free world . #% Mr President , this is a very worthy report that has been a long time coming through the system . #% The third thing is that we can not see the future because we can not get an agreement with the Americans . #% While coal and the mining of it contribute hugely to pollution , in some countries , they also provide huge employment . #% Ongoing reforms are needed ; constant vigilance is necessary against the ability of mankind to interfere with , interrupt or corrode public life . #% Parliamentary investigations are necessary , particularly in countries like my own , Ireland , where it has been established that 50 CIA flights have landed at Irish airports and that the aircraft used to transfer Abu Omar illegally from Italy to Egypt , via Germany , also landed at an Irish airport . #% The American decision is deplorable and it sends out a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world as regards nuclear disarmament . #% Finally , it must not be a case of the last person off the island turning the lights off . #% It would only increase our farmers ' difficulty . #% I query the degree of compatibility between the Commission 's commitment to the EU agricultural model , which is based on family farming , and the proposals in the world trade negotiations . #% This resolution calls for a targeted and coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women , as stated in the EU Roadmap for Equality between women and men . #% Unfortunately , these oppressed people look to the billionaire and former Prime Minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , for a solution . #% Yet this is not how EU funds are being applied . #% As a consequence we have inherited a large body of political and public opinion which is not committed to European integration and this has acted as a brake on our European ambitions . #% In Ireland , we have gone from 65 % dependency on imported energy in 1990 to over 90 % dependency today , and rising . #% I would welcome some opportunity to discuss this matter of local development and the contribution it can make , not just to employment creation , but also to tackling social injustice throughout the European Union more generally . #% We need urgently to examine why our response is always - as I said yesterday and others said today - too little , too late . #% If the proponents of EU citizenship think they will make the EU more loved and more wanted by promoting direct Brussels taxation , then I have to say that , happily , they are more out of touch with the citizens than I ever thought they were . #% Must we wait for years more of serious risk to the health and environment of people in the British Isles and Europe generally ? #% We should be training people in research management and ethics . #% Mr President , thank you for your courtesy in allowing me to ask a question . #% I welcome the Brussels Summit decision to allow the European Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate countries on all outstanding issues by early November . #% Other important proposals include cross-border checking of persons convicted of sexual abuse , to prevent them from obtaining employment where they would have direct contact with children in other Member States , and increased victim protection during investigations and trials . #% Member State governments must put in place a favourable tax regime which will encourage and reward enterprise , bearing in mind that a tax concession which encourages enterprise is far more cost-effective than the payment of social welfare to the unemployed . #% Another problem is the lack of knowledge of the procedures among some lawyers and judges who only deal very rarely with these cases . #% I wish to draw attention to the derogation that sets the same recovery and recycling targets as for the other twelve Member States , but allows Ireland , Greece and Portugal longer to achieve them . #% We need to make European businesses more competitive ; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small - and medium-sized enterprises . #% The importance of this ILO Convention is that it will provide legal recognition of domestic work as work . #% There is going to be an Atlantic dream financed partly by EU aid while the fishermen in Northern Ireland are being pushed to destroy their own boats . #% One of the extraordinary things about fish is that while fisherman have been finding it difficult and jobs have been reduced , the price of fish , almost alone as a food product , has been increasing continually over the years to the consumer in Europe . #% I do not support a one-China policy ! #% I think there are only nine Member States -- if my facts are correct -- that have the benefit of this . #% I should also like to stress that the information technologies should not create greater regional and social disparities : they should contribute to reducing such disparities . #% But with the principle of proportionality well respected , proposals to use the structural funds in this regard will help countries like Ireland to focus on what they actually need to do . #% Europe must advance with social progress hand in hand with economic progress . #% I can not accept that it should apply to core public services . #% Important socioeconomic benefits of the programme will also be lost . #% Have provisions in respect of nuclear installations which affect the territory of another Member State , particularly in regard to any cumulative effect of hazards to the health and environment of neighbouring populations , been agreed ? #% Madam President , like other Members I would like to wish the Dutch presidency the very best of luck in a very important year for the European Union . #% Right across Europe , the abuse of alcohol by children and adolescents is a growing problem . #% Lastly , in giving my support to this report and the accession process , I also wish to see the accession countries , national parliaments and governments having the same voting rights at the European Convention as the existing Member States of the Union . #% We must ensure that these measures are applied in an equitable manner . #% Related to this motion , I believe the EU needs to show some initiative in encouraging the international community to plan for and prepare for natural disasters in the future . #% Commissioner Byrne , I may add , is to be commended for his prompt action in agreeing to produce a White Paper on EU food law later this year and also to tighten up the EU ' s rapid alert system for food emergencies . #% If that means adapting boat engines so that they can run on a high percentage of alternative fuels such as bioethenol then we must take the necessary measures to adapt boat engines accordingly . #% As I have already stated in this House this morning , the people I represent especially have no confidence in Commissioner Patten . #% Finally , I seek clarification from the Commission in relation to the proposed Objective 1 in transition status . #% A man has been unspeakably , brutally murdered and the perpetrators have been able to walk freely and have not yet been brought to justice . #% You have tried hard to be factual in your report and that is appreciated but you must admit that , on the whole , your report is rather optimistic about the future of nuclear power in Western Europe . #% For this reason in particular it is a great shame - if I may say so , coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral - that the obligations , responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union , and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty . #% EU funds are required by Article 11 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1260/1999 to be truly additional , and not deployed to replace domestic funds . #% Could I , in that context , ask the Council and the Commission to agree that the first priority in any referendum should be that it should be seen to be both free and fair ? #% Mr President , I think we should vote . #% While every individual State in this Union insists on going its own way and designing its own policies for foreign aid , we will not have the political influence , or the material effect on the wellbeing of the people to whom we extend aid . #% I share the concerns regarding imbalances within the euro area , such as speculation in the construction sector , whose excesses contribute to asymmetric shocks , and call on the Commission to study possible mechanisms to improve the economic governance of the euro area and curb the expansion of such imbalances . #% We can not prepare a vaccine in advance or stockpile it . #% I would ask what does `` urgent '' mean in this context ? #% People are very willing to allow legislation to be put in place and oppressive measures to be brought in because they are concerned about these issues . #% BSE and foot-and-mouth have added a new and unexpected dimension to the European agenda . #% At the half-way point to the 2012 deadline set under the first Kyoto commitment period , the world is engaging in rationalisation , hammering nails in the coffin of attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before we even enter the second phase of implementation . #% I appeal to the Council , therefore , to make the new formula work so that we can have a common , strong , unified human rights report , representing a European view on human rights , that we can send to all corners of the world . #% 
So I refer to the things I do not agree with . #% There is a huge divergence of opinion just on that point alone . #% Again , Mr President , thank you for your statement . #% Mr President , I agree with all speakers here today who have said that there is no argument for paramilitary justice . #% Just as in Ireland , market capitalism and financial speculation have devastated the economies of the Baltic States , including Lithuania , where unemployment has rocketed to 18 % and youth unemployment to a staggering 35 % . #% The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind . #% Mr President , earlier this year , I had the honour to be part of a delegation from the European Parliament to New Delhi and Nepal . #% If the police had acted as they should have done four months earlier this situation would not have deteriorated to one where the children 's lives were at risk and where the parent who had abducted was threatening to burn down the house . #% Two wrongs do not make a right . #% That being said , the majority of the report is worth supporting , as a strong statement against the process of extraordinary rendition , as a breach of international law . #% FIFA , the world 's governing body for football , has said that there has been a recent upsurge in discriminatory behaviour towards fans and black players , an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing by many European clubs of players from Africa and Latin America . #% Madam President , first I should like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Simpson for a wonderful report based on common sense and pragmatism . #% As I have said in previous debates , farmers are the victims of circumstances beyond their control and those responsible for the manufacture of animal feed which puts public health , our entire livestock sector and indeed farm incomes at risk , have much to answer for . #% We must encourage the public to donate blood . #% Such a statement is blatantly dishonest and he knows that well . #% Bend that rule and we and democracy will be the losers . #% There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report . #% One of the issues still to be decided in these negotiations concerns the number of European Commissioners to be appointed in the future . #% We welcome the fact that Japan has donated USD 1.3 million to the refugees , and that USD 1 million has been forthcoming from world food programmes . #% Madam President , we need to wage a concerted war on drugs . #% The first thematic issue is a difficult one politically . #% If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation , it is incredible to put it up as an example . #% I would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards , because here we received conflicting answers in committee . #% The statements by our European leaders and President Prodi are very much welcome in this regard . #% There is tension , even within the EU , as to how it should be handled . #% Finally , we need to carefully evaluate all applications because it is crucial that assistance is made available as quickly and efficiently as possible . #% . I commend the rapporteur for her tremendous work on this vital subject . #% But here the European fleets did help . #% I think 2007 as the Year of Equal Opportunities for All can become a platform for just that . #% This is an issue of violence between people who at some point must have loved each other . #% Speed is now essential . #% Mr President , I believe that overall the German Presidency was a very positive period . #% In circumstances where fish is scarce and expensive , as it is in the European Union , it is very wasteful to use any fish for industrial purposes if it can be processed for human consumption . #% My own group , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , is strongly committed to the general concept of developing a capacity for autonomous European action which correctly has been identified as a rapid response capability with the necessary logistical support . #% I was particularly struck by the sincerity of the presentation made to us by the German presidency , and indeed by Commissioner van den Broek . #% Tomorrow 's vote is an historic one , though we call many votes historic in this Parliament . #% Without prejudice to the question of substance - the abolition of duty-free - the call for a study remains as valid today as it was before , and I renew it now . #% As a consequence of this I was being asked to vote on amendments which I had not had the opportunity to consult about or research and on which I would be precluded from debating on the floor of the House . #% The maternity care services are appalling . #% The timetable in which Member States will produce their maps to DG IV predetermines potentially Objective 2 areas on the future structural fund map . #% Any reform of the CAP should be geared towards preserving and encouraging the continuation of the family farm as the foundation of the European agricultural sector . #% I wish to raise also the discovery of eight people dead in a container of furniture in County Wexford over the weekend . #% On our chaotic health system ? #% This concession should be taken off the table in a short period of time if there is no reciprocal response on non-agricultural market access and on services . #% The Middle East process has a better chance of success if the European Union and the United States work together with all the key contracting parties in the region so as to ensure that the present road map for peace guarantees both Israeli and Palestinian statehood and security in the region . #% Also , bearing mind that our own Irish Minister , David Andrews , has launched a campaign for a nuclear-weaponsfree world , backed by one other Member State of the European Union , it is also important that other Member States of the European Union back David Andrews on this initiative to get rid of nuclear weapons totally . #% In spite of these efforts , something like 80 % of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish . #% If we are encouraging our SMEs to compete within the single market , we must at least be able to guarantee their protection against these appalling scams . #% Food is an internationally tradeable product and with consumers crossing frontiers on a daily basis , nothing short of a co-ordinated and common approach to food safety as spearheaded by the EU will restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain , and while there is a cost factor , particularly for farmers , it is I believe strongly in the interests of agriculture and individual farm families , that full confidence is restored as quickly as possible in all agricultural products . #% The Nice Treaty in no way affects this status . #% We know that there is a fairly high rate of road accidents as a result of truck drivers who are driving hours too long . #% I understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3 % in the European Union and 2.1 % in the euro area in 2006 , up from 1.6 % and 1.3 % respectively in 2005 . #% I welcome the two declarations agreed in Seville , one signed by the Irish Government and the other approved by the European Council . #% The best available method of ensuring job security for workers is by maintaining and , in many cases , improving the competitive advantages enjoyed by European-based industries . #% As many colleagues will be aware , the Commission is attempting to impose conditions on the Bureau which would have the effect of closing its office in Dublin . #% After purchasing CDs from a renowned high street store , namely HMV , I received an incomplete order with a promise of further delivery . #% It is unacceptable to reject measures to conserve depleted species because they would hurt completely unregulated fisheries for other depleted species . #% I would like that template to be used throughout the EU as part of the package of nuclear safety and security measures , so that there is a proper procedure and a proper forum to discuss real and perceived fears . #% It is then incumbent on those of us who support this Treaty , which will streamline how the EU does its business , to get out and positively promote its provisions to the people of Europe . #% No approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we , in Europe , stand up for . #% The buck stops nowhere if not with us here in the European Parliament , where , through the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , we are co-legislators with the Council . #% Mrs Ries has also strongly continued the important process of naming and shaming toxic chemicals and seeking their eradication . #% For example , I do not know what it is like in your country , but in my country , there is no such thing as a bank manager any more . #% This is the future direction that Pakistan needs to take . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will persevere with the philosophy behind the rational planning directive . #% During the Irish presidency the government should be seeking support from other Member States for an urgent reform of policing structures in Northern Ireland . #% 
It is essential to have that commitment now , at a time when the nuclear industry is saying that nuclear power can be good for Kyoto and good for the environment . #% Mr President , because time is short I will start by saying what we need to do . #% I would appeal to the President of this Parliament and the Political Group leaders of this Parliament to issue a joint statement to the Iraqi authorities and the Member States this week , urging that Iraq co-operate fully and that we operate entirely through the United Nations , thereby ensuring that international law prevails . #% I would ask the Commission to further elaborate on its proposals , as requested in the Hatzidakis report on state aid . #% We need to be in a position to implement the full policy agenda as set out by the Lisbon process . #% To highlight this minister 's hypocrisy further : yesterday , for the first time in the history of the Geneva Convention , there was a meeting of the 141 countries that signed that Convention in 1951 . #% We must win over national public opinion . #% The EU 's abandonment of sanctions in 2005 has been an utter failure . #% The real losers in this situation would be the small European farmers who are already on the breadline . #% These young journalists were totally amazed at the deep concerns many of us have about all aspects of childcare in Romania . #% The tribunals in which those guilty of atrocities in the Balkans are currently on trial send one clear message . #% It also enhances the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment . #% They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment . #% You are saying that you want a defence policy and defence system , not to protect yourself against potential aggressors , but to protect your fundamental selfish interests . #% For example in relation to water , soil , our health , flora , fauna and indeed climate , it is extremely important that proper information is made available . #% It has to be highlighted that the opening-up of postal services does not always bring benefits in terms of an increased level of employment and I would ask the Commission to address this in a detailed study that will be given equality , efficiency and customer-orientation in the postal sector , particularly as regards those peripheral areas . #% In relation to the working time directive on road transport operators , I have concerns about the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition of mobile workers . #% It is demonstrated throughout this Community that , in particular when dealing with employment problems , local administration can be very effective in dealing with the European funding . #% We have seen in the past that companies responsible for feed scandals never go to jail ; those responsible within those companies are never properly penalised . #% Mr President , during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative . #% Nowadays those young people have many other options open to them . #% Figures recently produced from the Central Statistics Office clearly show that the midland region was below 75 % of the average EU standard of living . #% I make no case for leniency of treatment at all . #% Let me remind the Commission that Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1275/94 specifically recognised the biological sensitivity of the Irish Box , and yet the Commission broke this important link . #% This is a reform which is both necessary and overdue . #% The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy , one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation . #% I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to his response . #% I have taken a quick look at the gender breakdown of the three programmes targeted for assistance and they run 91 % , 72 % and 79 % male . #% I have listed about 20 issues which the Commission should address . #% I know it is difficult and there are differences between the Member States on this , but there is a much wider concern for the future which has to be borne in mind . #% But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes , toys and household products made from cat and dog fur . #% This is an unacceptable situation which must be brought to an end . #% It may well indeed be possible that ten states could be ready by that time and if that is the case , that would be very welcome . #% I would like to conclude by saying that I condemn the recent and ongoing violence in the Middle East and any acts of anti-Semitism which have been and are being committed in Europe or elsewhere in the world . #% There were children who were being bred specifically to be put into an institution from which they were subsequently sold to people coming into that country to buy babies . #% There is a need for us to address the question of funding of pensions . #% If the Commission 's original Erika package had been implemented , single-hulled tankers like the Prestige would have been replaced by 2002 . #% In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection , and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment . #% With the benefit of hindsight we have not in the context of world trade provided the degree of protection necessary for our farmers from the obvious unfair competition and market manipulation by our competitors . #% This is a special edition on nuclear safety , for which I was asked to write a piece , which was later censured because of the heavy advertising of the nuclear industry in this magazine . #% Still we trumpet human rights and democracy clauses in partnership agreements with third countries , but non-compliance largely seems to go unmarked . #% The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority . #% I have no fears that what is being suggested is wild and savage liberalisation because we have insisted on regulation unbundling , public service guarantees and labelling for environmental impact which leads to informed choice by customers . #% Those who have called for this to happen should think about what they have now succeeded in achieving . #% I should also like to ask about the Council 's position on LSD and other illegal narcotics . #% But the high-rise flat occupants of the Greens know very little about the reality of farming today and have learned very little . #% I would like to use the brief speaking time I have to highlight the plight of the too-soon forgotten victims of terrorism . #% I should just like to take this opportunity , while expressing my appreciation of our Ombudsman 's work , to raise also the issue of the need for a special children 's Ombudsman in Europe . #% I have run out of time without saying what I wanted to say but I wanted to respond to some of the points already made . #% I also wish you to note a clause in relation to the abolition of the death penalty . #% Finally , there must be recognition that every human person is valuable and worthy of respect and that this respect demands that we allow people to speak and decide for themselves whenever humanly possible . #% I mention , in particular , those under the Leader Programme . #% Such a composition does nothing to ensure either the objectivity of the watchdog 's decisions or its independence as an authority from Hungary 's government . #% On the contrary , it is driven by - and is only for the benefit of - multinational GM companies . #% Manufacturers of cars have been selling cars to countries like Ireland , where there is a high rate of VRT , at a much cheaper rate than they have been selling them to other countries that have no VRT or very low rates of it . #% However , on the basis of the oral amendment , as rapporteur I can accept the overall amendment . #% The Convention on the Future of Europe has met in public , has debated in public , all the issues have been thrashed out in public . #% Reproach has been made in my presence that it is not the European Parliament 's job to put forward this sort of initiative . #% We have a report about to go before this House in Brussels . #% Thanks also to the Commission . #% Is this really what you want ? #% An effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the Eastern Health Board . #% As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases , owing to their high global warming potential or GWP , became recognised as a major contributor -- 5 % and rising -- to the ` greenhouse effect ' . #% In Ireland , as everybody knows , beef and milk represent 71 % of our entire agricultural output . #% The Commission also seems to be stalling on the other important areas , such as minimum income . #% Time and time again he has led them forward by the nose and time and time again they have allowed him to get away with it . #% 
When I spoke about other minority languages I meant those within the Union . #% Certainly the sentiment of what the Member raises is something the presidency , speaking as the presidency , would support . #% There is one further point to bear in mind . #% Those which delayed were wrong , especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union . #% We can not rely in the EU on traditionally high levels of tariff and quota protection . #% Mr President , I share the concerns of my colleague , Mr Maat . #% We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest , dedicated and extremely hard-working people . #% Commissioner Wallström wrote last March to the Irish Minister of the Environment , Mr Dempsey , suggesting that the large number of Irish environmental complaints currently being dealt with by the EU officials be dealt with in his department or by the Irish Ombudsman . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her response , even though it was very short and curt . #% I also believe that players have a huge role to play in this . #% Those of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are in the Chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight . #% The situation is now out of control and even though the British Agriculture Minister is insisting there is no crisis , the whole of the EU views with alarm what is happening in the UK . #% Local authorities the length and breadth of Ireland are still engaging in the process of finding new landfill sites for the future waste disposal programmes . #% It was a fascinating exercise . #% In fact I would prefer no prescribed minimums at all . #% They cooperated with the Commission in the technical measures and were prepared to look very sincerely at them . #% Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years . #% One hundred and twenty years ago there were 1.6 billion people in the world . #% In those countries which operate a general clause , we also know that operates differently . #% Europe is currently well behind other developed nations in implementing them . #% That in itself would be a test of how far countries are prepared to go . #% That is why , as a human rights spokesperson , I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report . #% I welcome the restated commitment of President Clinton to ratify this treaty as well as his renewed commitment to the maintenance of the US moratorium on nuclear testing . #% Our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 5.8 % in 2002 to EUR 14 900 . #% Here , Commissioner , we come to a matter I would like you to focus on : a glaring flaw in the common fisheries policy . #% However , Article 182 ( 5 ) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union , as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon , which establishes measures necessary for the implementation of the European research area , could provide a more appropriate legal basis for future joint programming initiatives in the field of research . #% This is , indeed , a very significant move on their part . #% Electrical or electronic switch gear , amongst other vital uses , will continue to use f-gases in a contained environment . #% Commissioner , do not wait until the lights go out again ! #% The tragedy demonstrates once again the desperate lengths to which people are prepared to go to try to improve circumstances for themselves and their families . #% I would like to correct Mr De Rossa : stem cells obtained from the destruction of embryos have , to date , produced no treatments , whereas stem cells from cord blood have produced over 70 treatments , and it is to be hoped that , some day , there will be a treatment for MS. #% I note that there are concerns . #% As we move into the next century let it be the first century in our island history in which we will have no killing on our streets and no emigration of our young people to other lands to earn a living . #% Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy . #% The British Government is continuing to hide the truth of Mr Finucane 's murder for its own political reasons . #% Too often public participation is filed away in some deep , dark drawer and very conveniently ignored . #% Regardless of third countries , can we even call our own EU countries safe countries ? #% Indeed we already have evidence that this will lead to job losses not only in the finishing sector but also in increased imports of finished goods at the end of the day . #% Those colleagues who are concerned about flags should bear in mind that if you could eat flags , there would not be a hungry child in the world . #% All in all , Socrates is addressing in a unique and effective way the need for a greater intra-community action in the field of education thus leading to a greater understanding and sharing of Europe 's diverse culture . #% I want the timeframe in which complaints are dealt with to be improved as we go forward . #% It is clear that the governments of the Member States of the European Union are more interested in trade than they are in eliminating poverty . #% At the present time , there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children . #% I have known you for some 20 years now and I know you to be a man of honour who has always been opposed to terrorism . #% Thank you very much indeed and I regret very much that I am leaving this great Parliament . #% That is a primary factor : that Members attend Parliament . #% After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending . #% Riyadh had an 82 % turnout of men only , even though the Saudi Arabian electoral law states that citizens are eligible to vote . #% We expect the same responsibility on the part of those who run our security forces not to abuse that right and not to abuse the tasks that we have given them . #% It is a national organisation which has benefited greatly from the Daphne programme . #% The President of Guyana actually said that they would receive EUR 8 million in debt relief because of the fantastic initiative undertaken by yourself and your government as leaders of the G8 with regard to alleviating debt in Africa and it would cost them GBP 44 million to try and comply with the reforms that would be put forward . #% Al Qaeda represents evil of a barbaric nature and for Al Qaeda human life means absolutely nothing . #% I respect the fact that there were sincerely-held views on both sides in the debate over Pakistan . #% I do not normally put down questions because I do not like to waste time , but I feel very strongly about this issue . #% In the light of the fact that the Commission recently banned CMRs in its review of chemical directives but has included it as an exemption , it is ridiculous that a substance can be banned from paint and polish but not from something that is put on your body . #% We know this is acceptable to the United Nations and the Palestinians , but regrettably it has been rejected by the Israelis . #% I welcome the broad support for this urgency but , on behalf of my group , I would like to indicate that we strongly oppose the two amendments tabled by the Green Group . #% On the issue of imperialism , it is quite clear in paragraph 4 of this document that ` the purpose of a common defence policy is to protect the Union 's interest in all areas , including security of supply ' . #% Mr President , like many other things in this world , if we were designing from the beginning a common agricultural policy today , I doubt very much it would take the shape or form we presently have . #% It is good that the Commissioner comes here and gives us full explanations and she is entitled to our support for the long-term objectives which she has set out . #% Better knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can provide an important contribution to the ability of citizens to make better informed and responsible choices regarding their health . #% Raytheon has been welcomed to Derry by no less than Nobel Peace Prize winners , John Hume - one of our own colleagues , and David Trimble . #% We need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken . #% Mr President , I extend my heartiest congratulations to Mrs Rothe for her exemplary work with colleagues in Parliament as well as with the Council and the Commission . #% There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being . #% The issue of most widespread concern is employment , both the provision of employment opportunities for those without work and the improvement of job security for those currently at work . #% 
I am also particularly pleased that the funds will support accessibility for people with disabilities and will promote integration of the gender perspective . #% To achieve these two objectives , it is necessary , as the rapporteur has said , to appropriately define what food supplements are ; it is necessary to put in place a scientific assessment of all the ingredients and their minimum and maximum doses ; it is necessary also to outline the key criteria for requirements with regard to consumer protection ; and of course , the quality of standards has to be looked into as well . #% Before the end of this decade , instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding , we will become a net contributor to the EU budget . #% If you look in the back of women 's magazines you can see a huge number of adverts encouraging women to put extra things into some parts of their bodies , and to remove parts elsewhere . #% As a result of the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and the adoption of many amendments , the balance of Mrs de Esteban Martin 's report has been overturned . #% What will happen , who will compensate people if there is an accident , if there is a disaster involving fisheries , tourism or any other issue ? #% In the potentially dangerous construction industry , accidents are much more likely to occur when people are required to work such long hours . #% It is important that we as Europeans say to the Congressional leadership today : ` You do not stand alone . #% It has also called for a legally enforceable regime whereby diplomatic assurances from third countries can be challenged in law . #% There comes a time within a negotiation when the kid gloves must come off , when action must be taken . #% Regarding the issue of cloning , I would have been happier with the original Amendment No 38 , but there are sufficient safeguards included in this compromise . #% The UK Presidency has been very cooperative and has taken on board many of Parliament 's amendments , which allows us now to vote on this first reading package of the general enacting terms of the European payment order . #% Regarding Amendment 2 , while I disagree strongly with Pope Benedict 's quoted stance on the prophylactic use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS , I could not support this amendment because of the gratuitous and inaccurate drafting . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Blokland for his report which strives to improve the Commission 's proposal , and the authors of the other amendments which do so as well . #% The report talks about the need not to fuel religious fundamentalism or provoke any unnecessary anti-Western reactions . #% We are all very concerned by media reports coming from Kosovo , especially of rape being used as a weapon of war . #% So we have to look at what we are doing and the interests of consumers have to come before the interests of big business and profit . #% I do not support the legalisation of ecstasy , cannabis or other synthetic drugs such as LSD or amphetamines . #% It is high time we looked at those issues . #% Some Member States , including Ireland , were additionally afflicted by the foot and mouth crisis . #% However , I remain unconvinced by the buy-out scheme . #% If it is in any way damaged , there will be serious implications for rural society in Europe in the future . #% The horrendous terror to which they have been subjected is unspeakable . #% We are in a situation which sends a very bad signal from an ecological and sustainable fisheries point of view . #% in writing . - At a time when the Commission , and indeed this Parliament , ought to be searching for , and bringing forward , proposals on how to save money , we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework . #% With regard to the idea of sending a delegation from Parliament , if we agree to do that , it must build on the work of people who have already gone out , and not just be a sensational visit . #% It is nonsense to try to ensure that we have a body which in the long term will deal with communicable diseases but which will not have the resources to do its job effectively . #% The Commission and successive Presidencies , including the United Kingdom Presidency , have stepped up their efforts to achieve better regulation by improving the quality of EU laws and transposition and implementation . #% The PPE and PSE refuse to acknowledge a link with the BNFL MOX shipments to Japan . #% I do not support a system of inequality between the levels of funding available to students from the various Member States participating in the Erasmus programme . #% What is all conflict about ? #% The challenge now is to let democrats move on without them . #% There was a time when we had a limit of 1.1 % . #% It is unfortunate , therefore , that both the Commission and the Council are still taking the side of the cosmetics industry and those responsible for profit-driven torture of animals . #% The worst European tsunami in recorded history occurred on 1 November 1755 , when a powerful earthquake off Portugal 's Atlantic coast sent waves crashing into Lisbon . #% They lay down their whiskies to age for up to 12 to 20 years . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% Why was British Nuclear Fuels unwilling to release enough information to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to enable it to assess the safety of nuclear storage at Sellafield ? #% Even if the conduct of foreign policy - and in particular , the security and defence dimension of foreign policy - is essentially for government , it follows that because of the nature of the policy terrain and the instruments available it can not be government 's exclusive concern . #% Ireland will play host to the Special Olympics in 2003 , and the contribution of the EU to the organisation of this event is also worthy of praise . #% If it was not the weather , it was quotas or bad prices . #% I will be voting against that and I will explain why in a moment . #% I believe , in a certain way , the Summit has captured that . #% Mr President , terrorism is the destruction of democracy . #% There is now , however , a very strong case for regionalization in Ireland for the next round of Structural Fund monies . #% We should recall the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we must find : ` unity of purpose in the post-war phase in Iraq ' . #% Regarding enlargement : my group is deeply committed to that process but I would say to the Commission - and I say it also to this House and to Mr Solana - that we really need to focus quality time and attention on Cyprus . #% To some extent we have lost track of what we have been trying to do . #% This communication addresses the issue of the research and development ( R&D ) phase of a pre-commercial product . #% In the year 2002 the euro coins and notes will become a reality and we hope be jingling in plenty in the pockets of the citizens of Europe . #% This has , of course , put Ireland in the solid economic position which it is in today to meet the convergence criteria of EMU . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission for the contributions they have made here today . #% He is asking for flanking measures to ensure EMU and cohesion come together and we are asking also for a solidarity mechanism to protect the financial markets against speculation and to include countries wishing to come in . #% We should also look at the issue of , for example , blue whiting . #% Today is the tenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia as it then was . #% Mr Cornelissen has put his finger on the pulse . #% The situation is grim and it is urgent . #% In relation to China , we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked . #% The country with the highest levels of pollution -- the United States - refuses to consider the global need for their ratification of the Kyoto Protocol . #% The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union . #% There is more to do . #% Vessels are to be re-flagged , supposedly with a provision that it does not lead to an increase in the overall capacity of the Latvian fleet . #% That is not a satisfactory way of achieving the objectives of the Lisbon process . #% Our President has communicated to you a scheme that we would commend . #% We need to use our current aid budget effectively , that is not just more aid , but better aid . #% What we have to do is release this new dynamic at individual level by saying the resources are there , even within the framework of sound finance . #% 
Most organizations which operate on a multinational basis have developed a policy of rotating senior staff . #% Last night I heard Jeremy Paxman on saying that the reform of the sugar regime in Europe was the most disreputable and inefficient form of subsidy given to farmers in Europe and is harming farmers in developing countries . #% These regions have very major tourist potential , but they suffer because of lack of comparable access . #% I say ` perceived ' threat because some of the headlines in the media over the last six to seven months suggest that the end of the world is imminent and there is no escape from the dangers and the risks presented by the spread of avian flu . #% I have a special word of appreciation for the Irish Parliament for its pragmatic and sensible approach to this project . #% We know that the European economy has been sluggish recently . #% In relation to China I would hope that the Council would take a position which reflects the position of Parliament : the only democratically-elected institution within the European Union . #% I seriously hope that the committee 's final recommendations will be fully reflected in the forthcoming legislative proposal . #% This resulted in hundreds of veterinary medicine products being removed from the market and huge welfare problems in Europe for minor animal species - including horses - for many years . #% This could turn out to be a Charter to waste energy , not save energy , and I would suggest to you that would be a very grave and dangerous outcome . #% We have to address this issue . #% The fact that Hizbollah , supplied by Iran and Syria , was able to act as it did while part of the Government of Lebanon illustrates the folly of ever admitting to government any terrorist-orientated organisation , be it in Lebanon , Palestine or , indeed , in my own Northern Ireland . #% We are all conscious of the need to reduce the volume of waste now disposed of in landfill sites and every effort must be made to find more environmentally friendly alternatives . #% Finally , again I say to the UK presidency : keep up the good work , two weeks left and remember the last hurdle is also an important one to negotiate before you successfully make the finishing line which I am sure you will . #% Progress was made on the new European monetary system , the legal status of the Euro , and the Stability and Growth Pact . #% Interestingly , a recent House of Lords report on aviation 's contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years . #% Mrs Doyle has listed many of the technical points I wished to make about the conditions of junior working doctors . #% The framework decision would apply to laboratory activities relating to DNA and fingerprints , and each Member State ensures that the results of the accredited laboratory activities carried out in other Member States are recognised as equivalent to the results of the accredited domestic laboratory activities . #% According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization , up to 450 people are dying there each day . #% If the money is not secured in the budget and a preventive approach can not be taken , the consequences , financial and otherwise , may be much greater . #% It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment . #% It is quite appropriate that we should be reforming the Commission 's foreign delegations and examining how they can perform in a much more efficient way , hopefully in the context of a much more coherent common foreign and security policy . #% We have a duty and an obligation to treat everyone in this world equally . #% We have to get the balance right between ambition and realism when it comes to the matters before us . #% Mr President , I shall be the last tonight to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very good report . #% I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace . #% EU Heads of State have affirmed on a number of occasions that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people both collectively and individually must always be protected . #% The overall financial assistance from the Union to the states which comprise the former Republic of Yugoslavia now amounts to EUR 475 million . #% President , we can only vote on the amendment in front of us and the amendment in front of us asks for four words to be deleted . #% Mr President , I welcome this report . #% The European Union as a political entity is a friend , and will always be a friend , to the Muslim people . #% In my view this is compatible with the Convention of the Rights of the Child . #% Allowing the sale of objects containing dangerous substances which children will put in their mouths goes completely against the precautionary approach . #% This provides a mechanism for developing closer co-operation in the fields of police and judicial activities in the areas of criminal law . #% We simply want evidence that a partnership pact is going to be an operation with local authorities , with NGOs and , indeed , with the social partners . #% The actions and statements of the Sinn Féin leadership over the last few months have failed to make any significant progress in getting justice for the McCartney family . #% I recognise that this was a difficult compromise which does address the problem - the potentially disastrous consequences of absolute freedom of movement - while at the same time recognising the need to respect the new law . #% In our desire to help the environment , whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels , we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union , if we so wished . #% I would therefore urge Commissioner Flynn here tonight to come forward with a draft directive and I would urge Members to support the report and the amendments to which I have appended my name . #% We are spreading our net a lot wider this time , hopefully not too thinly . #% Such permitted assistance as there is in that response , is for many regions , particularly in the United Kingdom , likely to be more theoretical than real because of national governments ' resistance to match funding or any form of state aid . #% The main aim of the Cohesion Fund was to help countries with the greatest structural disadvantages ; the beneficiaries of the Fund having a per capita GNP lower than 90 % of the Community average and committing to adopt a convergence programme . #% Mr President , the first thing I would like to say is that President Moi must deliver on his preelection promises for constitutional reform . #% In the interests of transparency , this document should be available in all languages so people can see what is going on at these K4 meetings . #% Indeed , why has Ireland not ratified the Europol Convention and why are we not fully participating in it ? #% This has been central to the problem of the common fisheries policy for decades and nothing that has been put in place by way of improvement has worked to date . #% That image represents the final lifting of the artificial barriers that separated eastern and western Europe for so long . #% - I was disappointed to see that in the decision of Parliament and Council establishing the `` Youth '' Community action programme , reference to the family has been removed in final conciliation negotiations . #% Would he agree that the European Union , as well as the institutions within the European Union , should encourage and support this development and also that these further developments would strengthen the case for the Irish language to become a working language of the European Union and the institutions of the European Union ? #% If we insist on democracy in this process -- not just in word but in reality -- then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept . #% Nevertheless , we can not deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late . #% Mr President , clean and safe bathing water is an obvious necessity , and an essential aid to a prosperous tourist industry . #% Clothing and footwear companies suffer the greatest losses and consumers are the victims . #% Next , the disabled . #% I also want to wish David Trimble , First Minister , and his Deputy First Minister , Seamus Mallon , their government , the Assembly members and the people of Northern Ireland , peace and prosperity into the next millennium . #% Regarding the Minister 's response , it is quite clear that the Council is playing a role here , in that it is agreeing on the Europol Convention . #% The MAGPs , which we will come back to later today , have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , it is absolutely crucial that the G20 employment and labour ministers put quality jobs at the heart of their economic recovery plans . #% You tell us today how much the European Parliament encourages you and offers your Commission incentive to further your reform programme . #% It would be wrong for us in Europe to ignore what is happening . #% We must acknowledge that he is a person who understands the common agricultural policy in all its extremely complicated detail . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his clear and concise introduction to what is a complex , emotive and difficult piece of legislation . #% The situation that now exists challenges the democratic credentials of EU leaders . #% If we have the partial reforms that the Commissioner is proposing here today , and we carry those out in opening up the market to grey trade supermarkets , in particular Internet sales , is it not the case that the block exemption becomes obsolete , and when will the day be when we actually get rid of these rules ? #% Ethnic , religious , social and national differences play no role in sport . #% I think we have to look at solutions to the problem without boundary . #% 
We often hear in this House that European citizens somehow feel far removed from decisions taken at European level , that the issues dealt with are not ones that impinge on their daily lives . #% As far as my group is concerned , the purpose of the European process is to ensure that this kind of horror never happens again . #% I also found that there were certain human rights problems . #% I am also very concerned about the projected increase in fluorocarbons , which are presently a minor contributor to the total greenhouse gases . #% In a recent national poll , nine out of ten Irish people stated that they did not understand the Treaty of Nice and voter apathy is extremely high . #% We strongly urge Parliament to reinstate the need for a separate ethics committee able to look at patent application and Amendment No 76 regarding material of foreign and human origin ' . #% Despite what some may say , these actions have been successful in helping to reduce the supply , exchange information on best practice and intelligence on the activities of drug trafficking and drug dealers . #% Finally , when we speak about an area of freedom , security and justice , it is justice which must be first and foremost among those aims and ideals , because , unless we can guarantee people that their individual rights and freedoms are protected , then we will have failed in our first duty as legislators , namely , to ensure that the laws that we pass not only protect the common good , but do not adversely affect the minority . #% I note that the report on the one-stop-shops and the refund of VAT generally was only referred to Parliament because of a change to the legal basis . #% We must advance a positive agenda on trade matters and resolve disputes before they go to the WTO process . #% As employment in the processing sector continues to increase , this welcome development contrasts sharply with the serious decline in family farming and the reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career . #% In pursuit of this policy , we have worked constructively with the Hong Kong administration , reflected by the attendance of the former Chief Secretary Anson Chan and her successor , Donald Tsang , at meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy . #% It is being recast in order to simplify it and to make it easier for producers to tell which substances are banned , so as to avoid any unnecessary mix-ups that could be dangerous to the consumer and waste companies ' resources . #% While this dialogue can and does play a role in the transformation of human rights issues in China , it will only bear fruit if the European Union speaks and acts as one . #% I am not totally convinced that the consumer is really demanding this . #% I must say , however , that I am extremely disappointed with the industry 's lack of defence of their products and processes and , indeed , even their field trials , against unjustified scare stories . #% There is no point in trying to tackle it at only a national level . #% Madam President , the EPLP delegation voted in favour of the mergers and takeover conciliation text . #% I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States . #% What I want it know is this : if , for example , these waste sites are closed down before the transposition into law of the directive , will they be exempt from the directive , in particular in relation to after-care ? #% I would like to respectfully request colleagues and those who are lobbying for the signing of the register to allow Members the leeway and the freedom to sign these resolutions without having to go through ' a wall of fire ' to get into the Chamber . #% Even if the investment were made , the outlay would not be justified in the long run , since the equipment would be lying idle for most of the year because not enough work would be available on a constant basis . #% Looking at some of the suggestions with regard to the maximum levels permitted under the reports , if you just take Ireland as one example , the air quality in Dublin , the capital city , is already meeting the standards that are set down within this report . #% They will give it the role that Parliament must , and should , have and which we know it has not got . #% I particularly support the compromise agreement reached on the sensitive issue of stem cell research , both adult and embryonic . #% We can return our attention to Africa and , while recognising the sovereignty of the African nations , we have to say that there will be conditions attached to our development aid . #% If we do not close the loopholes that facilitate fraud we will compound our problems , resulting in increased cynicism and hostility towards the European Union . #% I very much welcome the announcement today by the ETA organisation . #% It is little wonder that Turkey does not participate . #% I welcome the resolution calling for the settling of differences between the two trading blocs over issues such as the visa waiver and PNR . #% I listened with tremendous interest to Mr van Dam talking about half-baked approaches by the Commission and how well the Dutch fishermen were responding . #% Please keep reporting to Parliament . #% I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue . #% The budget lines dealt with by my committee are the most complex of any committee . #% These young doctors , these junior doctors , are dealing with serious emergencies in a condition of extreme exhaustion . #% Mr President , we all agree on the need to allow companies across Europe to run the EU-wide sales promotions . #% Those are my points . #% Maybe ` charter ' is a better word than ` treaty ' , and certainly more achievable . #% I am aware also , of the extent to which , in your many years of service in this House , you personally were committed to issues of institutional reform . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree with me that there are selfish as well as selfless reasons for refocusing our effort on the developing world ? #% As I stated in my reply we are continuing to monitor the situation . #% We need at least 2.5 % ; that is attainable . #% This scourge must be tackled , and my delegation supports this report which sends a strong message that the European Parliament will not tolerate fraud , evasion or tax havens operating with impunity . #% We must take particular care to avoid duplication of effort . #% Member States throughout the European Union are seeking agreement on policing throughout Europe and the Europol Convention . #% The Council of Europe is in the process of completing preparations for the world ' s first international convention on cyber crime . #% Remarkably , one priority is a European House of History . #% The same applies to trains or trucks . #% It has , thanks to the efforts of the Commission and Parliament , been better publicized in Northern Ireland . #% Only now , after almost 20 years of use , have we realised the permanent damage Ritalin has done to the development of the cardiovascular system of the young adult the child user becomes . #% I would ask the European Commission to take into consideration standards of human rights in all the aid schemes and cooperation schemes that the European Union puts into effect . #% Ease of mobility is needed if we are ever to achieve the proclaimed objectives of the Lisbon Summit . #% No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America . #% Actually , judging by demonstrations that took place in the major cities of Israel , there are many Israeli citizens who publicly oppose their Government 's action . #% His last remarks , as I have said , are about the construction of more nuclear power stations : this is completely inappropriate and nothing to do with the subject he was asked to report on . #% However , if the Commissioner needs to find leverage to shift the US position , I suggest that he works to get GM crops categorised separately from their natural equivalents . #% The decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption and the whole story of demand side management can not be ignored . #% But we do not take the final step , which is to create the means to prosecute people who we have found guilty of violating our laws . #% I very much commend the work that Mrs Berès has done on this report , but we are talking about transparency . #% This would have been unacceptable to us , unacceptable to the Irish Government and unacceptable to our farming community . #% Will you take any steps on the action plan for energy efficiency ? #% It also must be said that the recent remarks of Mr Prodi in the Irish media to the effect that enlargement can proceed even if Nice is not ratified , unfortunately adds to the confusion . #% The fact that BSE and its impact both on farmers and consumers continues to dominate our political agenda is an indication of the seriousness of the current crisis . #% Now is the time , we believe , to cool it ; the time for cool heads and calm reflection ; the time for a renewed but deepened commitment to resorting and sustaining the peace . #% We are looking for better cooperation between the Court of Auditors , Parliament and the Commission in the implementation of European policies and more efficient spending of European money . #% Nuclear waste should never be transported through densely populated areas . #% 
The Bolkestein proposal was flawed because it failed to recognise that if you want the public to support the opening-up of the market you have to convince them of the benefits and reassure them that it will not undermine working or consumer rights . #% Most importantly in the debate about the future of Europe is the kind of Europe we want : do we want a democratically participative Europe , do we want a socially inclusive Europe ? #% I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward . #% I am not happy about the whole procedure . #% The EU must not put further obstacles in the way of economic growth and stability . #% I commend to the honourable Member and to Members of the House an examination of the local development programme currently under way in Ireland . #% I therefore urge Ireland 's Minister of Finances not to renege on his promises to increase spending , on health in particular , and to lower taxes , especially for the lower-paid . #% But it is very clear that that alone will not be enough . #% I trust the Commission and the Council will see the merits of supporting this . #% I also see the importance of community development measures that will stimulate the economy and activate untapped economic resources in the region . #% It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for . #% Great credit is due to the Council for taking on board so many of the amendments Parliament sought to bring forward after first reading . #% How does this marry with the idea of the single market ? #% We have to be pragmatic about this . #% I welcome this proposal both because it provides greater information for consumers -- particularly those who suffer from allergies -- and because it lays down a high level of product safety through increased transparency and producer responsibility enforced by a system of national sanctions for non-compliance . #% Certainly I , personally , would support the concept of an EU-wide list . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , can I begin by wishing the High Representative , Baroness Ashton , well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate . #% To this end , it is important that entrepreneurs in Ireland are fully informed on how to make best use of the Small Business Act . #% Does the Commission not agree that if a product or food producer causes an alert then it is both in the consumer 's interest and indeed in the interest of the open market that this information should be made public ? #% For example , we have had an announcement from Dublin that there are going to be bigger , larger and better boats . #% This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some , if not all , of the developing world . #% I want to refer specifically to the need for such integrated policy for women in rural society , for until now suitable employment opportunities have been limited , with women having to migrate to urban growth centres to find employment . #% I thank the Swedish minister here this morning for her confirmation that there is going to be a convention . #% For nearly ten years the EU has had a ban on the sale of products tested on animals but we have yet to implement this . #% The pharmaceutical industry wants a total exemption from the directive . #% The OSCE parliamentary assembly has also addressed the question of developments in human rights and sent a delegation to Turkey . #% Unfortunately , national agencies , both police and voluntary , have not had the same success . #% It is also fair to say that levels of preferential treatment , either in the form of tax concessions or grant aid , that are not acceptable within a Member State are also unacceptable within the European Union , whether these are in the form of benefits that come from the EU or from national governments . #% If we are to offset the effects of global warming and the resulting damage to the global economy , we must reduce the level of greenhouse gases . #% We need to work more closely together to combat the scourge of human trafficking . #% All Member States within the Union will retain the right to appoint one member to the Commission until 27 countries become full members of the Union , and even at that stage , positions in the Commission will be distributed between all Members on a rotation basis . #% Parliament is perfectly correct to emphasise the need to make maritime transport safer , better protect the marine environment and enhance shipping security . #% What action is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States are properly applying the laws in this regard ? #% Mr President , on a point of order : before you ask the first speaker to make a contribution , I indicated that I wished to be added to the list . #% If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either . #% The Commission 's communication on the future of health care and care for the elderly , focusing on accessibility , quality and financial viability , provides a useful framework for policy exchange regarding the challenges that all Member States are facing in this area . #% The eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission published today states that IRA members are still heavily involved in fuel smuggling , and that the level of smuggling has remained more or less constant . #% That would inevitably lead to protectionism , which is already raising its ugly head following the French and Dutch referendums . #% I believe that the WTO in its current structure and working practices is dead . #% At present , there are 213 Irish troops among the KFOR force stationed in Kosovo . #% President , our hearts go out to the two radiation workers who were subjected to intense radiation poisoning and to the 300,000 people who were in terror as radiation levels skyrocketed . #% in writing . - This directive is one of the first legislative responses of the EU for the financial crisis . #% So there is an opportunity to consider this matter in Singapore and at the Dublin European Council meeting in December . #% We welcome the proposals to assist regional competitiveness in former Objective 2 areas and we look forward to hearing more details on how this will be allocated and on the indicators used to identify those areas . #% I would like to join , I am sure in the name of all in this House , in utterly condemning that terrorism and in expressing condolence and sympathy to those who have been injured and killed . #% On the key question of market access , we must move towards improved access to EU markets for exports from developing countries , so as to ensure that negotiating proposals take account of the economic interests of all parties . #% Indeed , paradoxically , the Danish instrument of ratification of Nice will be lodged in Rome today ; the French , as we have heard , have also ratified the Treaty . #% I am opposed to a major redistribution of direct payments , as suggested . #% The euro notes and coins will not physically be in consumers ' pockets until the year 2002 . #% This is not about harmonisation ; this is more about mutual recognition of 25 varying and different regulations in the Member States to ensure that small companies , small innovators , can be guaranteed legal certainty and financial certainty with regard to the protection of their ideas and the promotion of them . #% Finally , I want to support the author of the resolution , Ms Berès , when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers . #% Could I say to the President and to the sessional services that it would be helpful if there were monitors in all the meeting rooms to ensure that we were fully au fait with what was happening in the House . #% We need certainty in our law . #% We have two pieces of international legislation to deal with this issue : the Luxembourg Convention and the Hague Convention . #% Tying education , innovation and research into a coherent supportive policy is a vital part of a functioning knowledge economy . #% To date , Ireland has done nothing to meet its international obligations , but continues to provide complicit sanctuary for these international terrorists , making a mockery of their affirmations in this House , when President of the Council , that they were committed to the fight against international terrorism . #% I would stress again that these are difficult times for farmers . #% in writing . - The situation with credit ratings agencies must be addressed in Europe . #% In conclusion , I welcome the statement from Commissioner Fischler on the proposal to decouple aid for tobacco producers , which will hopefully lead to a reduction in the production of this health-damaging crop . #% On our crumbling school buildings ? #% In fact , I am sure you can appreciate that the current government is spending more time rearranging the deck-chairs on the Titanic than developing innovative approaches to employment . #% The alternative is the United States making bilateral agreements from a position of strength with the poorer countries of the world . #% So , in order to clarify all this , let us not take a third outside organization into this , namely the Nicole Pery ad hoc committee , because I was a member of that working party and on this particular matter it did not do anything of that nature . #% For example , the fact there is a big difference in water consumption between hot countries and cold countries is not taken into account when discussing how much water people drink . #% I believe that the safeguards are in place to guarantee that these feedstuffs will all have been tried and tested before they enter the food chain . #% But let us begin a renewed , an improved , deeper relationship and one that will not crumble as the last one did . #% 
The European Parliament , as the democratically elected European body which will later on colegislate on the Commission proposal for the Capital Requirements Directive ( CRD 4 Directive ) , should be involved in the negotiations process at an early stage . #% The idea is to distinguish between how an enterprise relates to internal stakeholders , shareholders and employees . #% Mr Ahern 's slogan at home is ` more to do ' . #% The facts speak for themselves in this regard : over half a million people die in the Union as a direct consequence of smoking each year . #% It often prolongs very real human misery but as far as I am concerned one of the major problems it provokes is that of the abduction of children . #% The review of EU animal feed legislation in the wake of the recent series of scares is most welcome as it goes to the root cause of problems that have arisen . #% What about political fundamentalism , or cultural or environmental fundamentalism ? #% Indeed , the Commissioner , in a response to the debate , said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes . #% May I say to the Presidency that the difference with the DCECI is that it seeks to replace 16 codecided regulations with one regulation . #% Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation . #% A great proportion , though by no means all of them , are parentally abducted children . #% At one level it may be that this is possible , because clearly an investor in pension funds is interested in having a stable market . #% There is a report in Irish newspapers today that the Commission is insisting that the rescue and aid package the Irish government will provide for Aer Lingus must be privately funded . #% The gates were locked . #% Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel , but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry , restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance . #% My approach is to try to find the appropriate solutions so that different economic interests are catered for in a mutually acceptable way . #% in writing . - There is something disturbing about a world apparently helpless to save innocent children from being blown apart in war . #% Why do Tibetans try to escape from China ? #% That is the problem we have to address and we must address it now . #% It is incumbent on the international community to redouble its efforts to find a solution . #% My response to Barcelona is one of relief that the hype about liberalisation and privatisation was in fact just hype , that the balance of political power on the Council still remains with the centre-left , with the common sense to know that the people of Europe want a social Europe as well as a market Europe , and that the balance between social policy and economic policy , of employment policy and sustainability needs to be maintained . #% Extending such joint surveillance exercises into the applicant countries should be an early objective . #% We do not have to decide for another 15 or 20 years about investment in a new form of power . #% Mrs Oomen-Ruijten brought forward issues that relate not to abstract numbers or abstract individuals , but to real people who encounter this kind of discrimination every day . #% They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing . #% He made sure that his friends in the horse racing business did not have to pay tax on six-figure-a-go stud fees . #% The European Commission has already dispatched a needs-assessment mission to Iraq . #% Using waste for renewable energies , recycling some other types of waste and incineration are among those that have been mentioned . #% The ODA quota must be even stricter than in the current DCI . #% What Mrs Malone said is very true : recital E is actually misleading . #% If their function has become obsolete , they should have access to similar jobs with the same conditions . #% It is important , however , that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas . #% However , there was a very good compromise , and I can not understand why Mr Ó Neachtain did not retable just his committee proposals and allow them to go through . #% Mr President , I should like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that this morning in Belfast the Northern Ireland Assembly came together , almost three-and-a-half years since it was elected . #% The new EU-Canada Partnership Agenda was launched under the Irish presidency in Ottawa on 18 March 2004 . #% May your future go well . #% Such events , thankfully are rare , as producers are reasonable people and their total livelihood and profit depend on the animals under their care being in good condition at the end of their journey . #% In my own city of Dublin the number of heroin addicts has been increasing steadily for the last 20 years and is estimated to be about 7 , 000 now . #% I welcome the debate today and I look forward to the debate in the national parliaments in the months ahead . #% The European Parliament should use this debate to make a statement and to send a message to mainland China , saying where the European Union stands . #% I hope the Commission can accept both those amendments . #% In insisting on the political reflection of the outcome of the recent European Parliament elections within the European Commission , how far should we go in restricting the choice of and dictating to national governments their selection of Commissioner ? #% It causes dental fluorosis , damage to the tooth enamel , which is symptomatic of fluoride poisoning in childhood . #% I wish him all the best in his new role . #% We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya . #% Mr President-in-Office , I , like everybody else in this House , would like to wish the Italian Presidency success over the next six months . #% Commissioner you say that as far as new facilities are concerned , if there are to be any , you feel that there is a case . #% The European Council must again address this issue in Dublin . #% For me , integration depends on our success in fusing the agricultural economies of candidate countries with existing Member States in a manner that causes least disruption to both and in time provides for their full participation in the common agricultural policy . #% We also need conventions for those areas to protect them . #% In Ireland groundwater and aquifers provide one quarter of our drinking water . #% I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today . #% In spite of generous EU support , which I acknowledge , family farms are disappearing from the rural landscape . #% Going back to the basics of economics , countries either meet this demand or it will be met elsewhere . #% We have always been outspoken about condemning nuclear tests . #% The more elements we drag in , the more un-transparent we make the system , the more difficult it becomes . #% I am pleased to say that remedial action has been taken and we look forward to an enhanced programme in this very important sector . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for helping to protect regional individuality and rural self-sufficiency . #% So the single market gives benefit to the Dutch and Germans . #% Tragically her son Neil died of a deep-vein thrombosis after a short flight to Benidorm . #% Tony Blair ' s wonderful new government , with its ethical foreign policy , has continued sending its arms to Indonesia . #% It is for this reason that when we all discuss the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 , we must remember the commitments we made to farmers in the past in relation to the single farm payment , and indeed to rural development , and we must put our money where our mouths are . #% Could you please define these measures , provide an estimate of the total cost of them , specify how they could be applied and outline the criteria for the allocation of these yet undefined measures ? #% It is much more comprehensive and , indeed , I have to confess that I do not see as many simple answers to the questions raised in this one as in my Young Farmers ' organisation in Ireland 40 years ago . #% However , I also led the majority of the group inadvertently into voting against paragraph 8 due to an incorrect voting indication . #% At present , none of the proposals to include additional bans on the use of F-gases in certain applications have been subjected to impact assessments or comprehensive health and safety or even cost-benefit analysis by the Commission . #% 
Madam President , I wonder why the honourable Member did not find the Liberal Group photogenic . #% His report is based on a resolution that I tabled . #% That is why again , in my report , I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , `` mono '' problems . #% Mr President , I have to say that I am shocked by the Council statement here today that not a single body of the Council has made any effort whatsoever to reach a common position in relation to our stance in the World Bank , or indeed to use the clout we clearly have financially and in voting terms on the World Bank ; despite the fact that every Head of State recently signed up solemnly to the European Constitution , which declares that we want to end world poverty , and despite the fact that each Member State has signed up to the Millennium Development Goals . #% However , on this occasion , the politicians got it wrong . #% Could you indicate to me when you expect this regulation to become effective ? #% I do not believe that the response we have had so far from the Commission is at all adequate . #% Child-labour-free does not only mean that there is no child labour being used in the parent company or even by its immediate suppliers : a company at the top of the supply chain must have the responsibility to ensure that all steps of , and conduits to , the supply chain are child-labour-free . #% I hope , Mr President , that you will send a message on behalf of this House and join with the European Council in congratulating Pope John-Paul and wishing him well as he continues his work for peace throughout the world . #% Power plants generally are a ticking time-bomb in our midst . #% Ireland 's quality chocolate sector employs 3 , 000 people and uses 50 million gallons of milk and 40 tonnes of Irish sugar . #% In addition to questions relating to the sovereignty and security between Israel and Lebanon , the return of refugees will be of particular concern to Lebanon , whose ethnic balance is disturbed by the fact that there are 250,000 Palestinian refugees on its territory . #% They make up the largest workforce in Europe ; they often lift beyond their weight and work around the clock , year in and year out . #% However , this macroeconomic average disguises large price increases in a long list of everyday items such as coffee , vegetables , bread , hairdressing and parking meters , largely due to opportunistic marking up or rounding-off during the changeover period . #% This is taking foolishness to the extreme and I ask you to reflect and take on board the views of the committee and the view of this Parliament on this particular point . #% The report also urges EU Member States to implement the Council Directive on residence permits so that the option of temporary residence can be granted to victims of trafficking . #% Multidisciplinary research , yes ; a European higher education area , with the synergies that implies for the European research area . #% It is better to rely on cooperation ; the carrot works a lot better than the stick . #% For me it is particularly unacceptable that in Ireland , which has recorded the highest economic growth rates in recent years , about 600 women are victims of breast cancer each year , and a sizeable number of those deaths could be prevented if periodic screening and diagnosis identified the problem early enough . #% So anyone who suggests that this issue is solely an internal issue for Egypt is wrong . #% This is a very important aspect that should be transferred to agreements with ACP countries as it is much more equitable . #% In more recent times we experienced the problems caused by the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines , the Erika tanker break-up off the French Atlantic coastline and , from an Irish point of view , the continuing problems caused by Sellafield . #% Mr President , since the attacks of 11 September , the Malaysian Government has stepped up its internal security measures , allegedly against suspected Islamic militants . #% We can not deny that the issue of developing deep-vein thrombosis is not a serious concern for air passengers . #% This is a regrettable situation ; not only is it a missed opportunity for the EU to use its considerable influence better in order to raise human rights standards , it also undermines the credibility of the EU in a key policy area . #% I just wish to point out to the President-in-Office that there is written and video evidence concerning this harassment . #% If the final report of the observation mission concludes that there were serious flaws in the conduct of the election and makes recommendations as to how they can be prevented in the future , the Council and the Commission must act and both must be prepared to use sanctions in the fields of EU trade policy and donor aid to achieve this . #% There are three questions in one in Question 40 , which will take another 20 minutes or so . #% That is why Serbia must not be ignored . #% By means of this directive no leaded petrol will be sold anywhere in Europe after January 2000 , except where severe socio-economic problems would arise . #% You know that the European Parliament has , over the past twenty years , given every political and financial support to encourage peace in Northern Ireland . #% I found it fascinating , but also frustrating . #% in writing . - On behalf of the Irish delegation to the EPP , We support the abolition of the death penalty and voted for the resolution on the World day against the death penalty . #% I urge the Council to convene an urgent and informal meeting of European ministers for health to seek to coordinate a European response . #% The Council , in my view , must now accept Parliament 's amendments to the Ombudsman 's statute on access to documents , as the Ombudsman pointed out . #% But having scoured medical literature and asked colleagues to point out to me the scientific and medical evidence , I can not find examples of people who have overdosed or killed themselves with vitamin C and various others . #% Finally , and not for the first time , I want to express my concern about research on human embryos . #% A clear message must go out from this Parliament , from the Commission and from the Council to the fishing industry that honest endeavours will be respected and those fishermen who abide by technical conservation measures that are devised by accredited European scientists in partnership with fishermen will benefit most . #% The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature . #% This is particularly worrying for European citizens who share a border with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe . #% This is where the thorny question is raised of who shall be responsible for ensuring that the claims are valid . #% The European Union puts huge resources and effort into keeping out so-called illegal immigrants , yet it can not stop the illegal import of trophies . #% In relation to the question that the honourable Member has asked , as she will be aware , a joint action is an enabling statutory procedure under the Treaties , specifically the second and third pillars as provided for in the Treaty on European Union . #% Under EU trading rules and in the interest of food safety and consumer confidence in animal health status , annual testing is required to maintain the official TB-free status of our cattle herds . #% in writing . - I support this report , which makes a number of important proposals to tackle the demographic challenges we face in a spirit of solidarity between generations . #% The situation is not altered by Ireland 's participation in the European Rapid Reaction Force , but it is still very important and politically necessary for a declaration to be made in Seville expressing the support of EU governments for this special foreign policy issue , which means so much to so many people in Ireland . #% The support provided by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is urgently needed by the workers , their families and the North Dublin community , deeply affected by the closure of this company , which brought the loss of more than a thousand skilled jobs . #% For too long in Europe we have been concentrating on financial and trade issues at the expense of major social issues such as the drugs problem . #% Firstly , we should recognise that Europol did not appear out of thin air . #% Let me finish by saying that we have taken the lead in the EU on these issues , but it would be regrettable if , in pursuit of a trade deal , we were to sacrifice our standards and the health of our animals and of our citizens . #% In the interests of equity , productivity and social stability , we must address the serious issue of Europe 's greying population and so we must create the optimum conditions for jobs . #% Mr President , the funding of destructive embryo research is against the constitutional position of Ireland , as it is against the constitutional , legal or political position of four other Member States . #% It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so . #% I would like to know how many more Commissioners are bending over backwards to facilitate specific business interests against the interests of the Community as a whole . #% This report assesses the effectiveness of such human rights clauses as regards implementation and adherence and proposes new ways to strengthen the clause to make it more effective and better monitored . #% Indeed , we will need sellers in the market for it to work . #% Who better to be President of Ireland than Mrs Banotti , who has worked for that in this House and who is the best placed to build bridges in Ireland itself and sweep away old enmities ? #% In my opinion , the real key to preventing injury and promoting safety is the value we place on the human person . #% The reaction from the citizens of Europe and other parts of the world has been absolutely outstanding : people have really shown their humanity to the people affected . #% It is clear that the WTO talks can not succeed as long as it insists on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihood of our small and medium farmers , because they are the ones at risk , not the agricultural exports , Commissioner . #% We clearly need a joined-up approach by various departments . #% We remain willing to assist them in the search for permanent peace in their beautiful country . #% Those people who try and tell us that we must put off this whole process and stop and listen to the voice of democracy are totally ignoring the voice of democracy as represented by the nine other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution . #% It is unbelievable that the United States is seeking to act outside international norms of law . #% I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis ' approach . #% Consumers will not forgo these products . #% 
I regret that the President of this Parliament diminished his office by joining the left-wing herd in what , however it is dressed up , amounts to a denial of the Commission-designate 's right of freedom of thought and speech . #% In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important `` Amsterdam leftovers '' . #% I congratulate Ms McKenna on her report . #% Neither Mrs Nicole Pery , who has left this Parliament , nor the working party , made any suggestions concerning the application of this rule . #% Mr President , the introduction of the EU beef labelling is a further step on the road to traceability and in the present climate a prerequisite for consumer protection and public health . #% What is this plan I am talking about and whose outlines are becoming more distinct as things progress ? #% We need to know if all the sacrifices that fishermen have made in the past have done anything to help the fishing industry , and the scientific evidence should be produced if they have it . #% In this policy of buying , on behalf of Community fleets , fish from third countries , I often ask myself whether it might not be better to spend the money in another way , in the interests of the regions which we set out to help . #% It is a fact that the treatment you get for epilepsy depends on where you live , and there is a huge problem with the lack of neurologists in some Member States . #% There is no point in people coming into this House and talking about liberal proposals when you look around and see young people dying from drug abuse , while the people who import and sell these drugs are getting away scot-free . #% Most importantly , now we can bring in private financing to give the extra impetus and kick-start needed . #% BSE is a disease of older cows , primarily older dairy cows . #% Property rights are a very major concern for citizens and one that I fear will become increasingly so , if I judge by the complaints coming into my own constituency office from citizens who have purchased properties across Member States of the European Union . #% I should like the Commission 's view on that . #% If I am a red-haired , fair-skinned Irish person , two hours ' sunshine is the maximum I should get , and with proper coverage from the sun , with a hat , covering up my skin and wearing protection . #% The concept offers education on the European Union and , by providing accommodation for the political groups , it ensures that the views of this Parliament can be conveyed to the citizens . #% Business and retailers must gear up their preparation for this date to ensure that the changeover goes smoothly . #% The international community should take note of this . #% Our government has reapplied , and I am hoping that that will change , because , if it does not , it ensures that the government can not apply really active measures from a state point of view to bring in larger companies . #% It is Parliament which is speaking for the citizen and taking up the issues of all our citizens , businesses , consumers , workers and the unemployed . #% Ireland had , until recently , a very active National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism ( NCCRI ) and a well funded Equality Authority . #% There is one point that , to many of us , is the issue of substance in this report . #% But the truth is -- and I am indebted to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for this gem of information , which I think we in this Chamber probably all know about -- there is no recognised scientific test to differentiate organic and conventional produce . #% In fact , relations visiting or trying to visit these prisoners have been subjected to intimidation . #% Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , we agree that after Lisbon we need a knowledge-based economy . #% In the light of recent reports , there is great fear for the safety of these people and the people with whom they work . #% Madam President , there are many aspects of this report which I support because it addresses serious problems in relation to women 's health . #% Mr President , though this House , in self-congratulatory euphoria , will embrace this Constitution , thankfully the ultimate decision rests with the Member States . #% Mr President , concern for public health must the overriding consideration for everybody associated with the food industry . #% Mr President , we need to look at where the light weapons are actually coming from . #% Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators , they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course . #% That is something again we will have to work on and similarly with core labour standards . #% Critics frequently cite the fact that under Kyoto the earth 's temperature would only be 0.15 ° C lower than if we do nothing at all . #% When we talk about the precautionary approach , Mr Blokland is wrong . #% With regard to the phase-out dates proposed by various Members , our aim should be for this legislation to enter into force as soon as possible , so that industry can begin to get rid of the gases with very high global warming potential , while maintaining the six-year type-approval timeframe . #% Principle number one is respect for difference . #% When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable . #% There is a huge amount of business to vote on . #% Whilst this is a difficult time , and whilst there is a lot of uncertainty , this is also an opportunity for us to reflect on what we have achieved so far , and to find a proper and more appropriate way forward . #% I would like to amend paragraph 5 of our text : ` welcomes the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES Appendix II ' . #% Member States ' company law allows for two different systems of company management . #% The great concern that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party took to this debate was to ensure that we should be able to protect appropriate diversity . #% There is no point using excellent fine words that we put on paper if we do not have the follow-through on both sides of the Atlantic and if we do not deliver . #% I do not object to trade with China , but I do object to the lack of compulsion upon them to reduce their emissions . #% I welcome the fact that we will participate but we participate as equals and not merely as observers . #% Let us hope that the publication of next month 's annual report will show significant improvement . #% In creating more and better quality jobs in Europe , we must implement a broad-ranging set of policies at EU level . #% I challenge the British authorities to let the consumers make up their own minds and ensure that Irish beef is sold in British supermarkets . #% I am not well-informed on the facts of the matter but my impression was that his intervention was based on verifiable facts rather than simply issues of political preference . #% Will the President-in-Office of the Council ensure that this matter is placed on the agenda for further consideration by the Spanish Presidency ? #% Some people will be justified in opposing this Treaty because of their political beliefs , ideologies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States . #% We must continue to coordinate with countries where high levels of illegal immigration originate and we must ensure that organised criminals involved in the sinister business of human trafficking are arrested and prosecuted for their crimes . #% I do not believe there is any justification for setting a date for the introduction of this scheme until the impact of EID , particularly in relation to traceability and disease control , has been assessed . #% If we take the right decisions now , we can ensure that the European Union economy grows and prospers in the future . #% I also strongly support information actions on the common agricultural policy . #% I disagree fundamentally with that approach . #% I will speak briefly about each of the reports . #% I do not think there will be a justification , because arms embargoes are a good idea on all countries internationally . #% We have made clear our view that further reforms are necessary in such areas as human rights , freedom of expression and democratic freedoms and we will continue to do so . #% The only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place measures which some people may feel discriminate against men . #% Considering that we are coming up to Christmas , this cruel and inhumane way of producing so-called food is unacceptable . #% Furthermore , it will not be French led but Irish led . #% A whole family was wiped out by these bombings , as shown in Mr Pilger 's documentary . #% What the Commission is doing is over-severe , and it is particularly important that we watch the budget for 2007 . #% The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the responsibilities of parents in providing the proper care and attention to their children , as well as the child 's right to receive this care , guidance , and love . #% What will the European Community do to help the Chaldean , Assyrian and Orthodox Christian communities ? #% 
Why are we paying to have empty fields and rusting equipment when we need sugar production more than ever ? #% European and Irish waste policies have to be based on a hierarchy of options , with prevention the most desirable and disposal the least desirable . #% They represent only 3 % of world trade . #% I am particularly sensitive to the issue in Ireland at this point in time . #% Mr President , the common agricultural policy remains the single biggest item of expenditure in the Community budget . #% I suspect from your speech , Mr Blair , that you are not prepared to face the real questions that arise from that . #% The bootleggers are up in arms at this , but now , with the Commissioner announcing his intention to take action against the United Kingdom for creating barriers to the free movement of goods , the door could be opened even wider to give smuggling an even greater field day . #% As you mentioned , Commissioner , Parliament 's position was eight hours . #% There are many less damaging forms of marker genes available and it is EU policy to prohibit all unnecessary use of antibiotics if there is a risk for human or animal health . #% I am seriously concerned , as many others are , with the ever-deteriorating state of the beef market and the confusion being created with regard to the vital matter of public health . #% I agree strongly with our rapporteur that the EU must use all its clout and diplomatic skill to defend geographical indications . #% Can you tell us that the desired effect has been achieved , as far as the scientists are concerned ? #% According to the latest available data , 31.5 % of employed women work part-time compared with only 8.3 % of employed men . #% ` Here ' being a vague and incomprehensible mess that will be defined in our courts . #% The European car manufacturers must assume the costs of equipping all new manufactured cars with car phones in the interests of the medium to long-term future of road safety for car users and their passengers . #% One of the issues which should be raised in this consumer campaign must relate , as has already been mentioned by the rapporteur , to the introduction of dual pricing in our shops and supermarkets in euros and in punts . #% We can not , however , turn the clock back but through carefully constructed training and educational programmes involving organizations such as CEJA , the European umbrella body for farm organizations and , in my own country , Macra Na Feirme , our young farmers ' organization , we can create the economic and social infrastructure necessary to encourage and help more young people to pursue farming as a credible career . #% How can it take 30 days , a period of time criticised at that stage as too lengthy , to get a UN force in place in Lebanon , yet with Darfur we are talking about three years ? #% The banning of the advertising and promotion of tobacco products within the Union is a positive step in the right direction , so that this very important social objective is achieved . #% Our responsibility is to find a balance between the needs of employed and self-employed drivers and the community at large , so as to ensure that the latter can go about its business safely . #% There were three adults found dead also - two men and a woman - and there are five survivors . #% The war has always been about controlling oil and in my view little or nothing to do with Kuwait . #% I would like to put on record a letter written yesterday by Professor Trakatellis , Chairman of the Conciliation Committee , and by me as rapporteur to President Barroso : #% It does not make any sense . #% So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe . #% Yet Mr Patten insists that the police must be responsible to a new ruling body on which the IRA will be represented . #% As Members of this Parliament , it can give us some satisfaction that we can make a contribution to alleviating some of the more immediate effects of redundancy for these workers , indeed giving them some hope for the future . #% My colleague , Mr McMahon , has already pointed out that because of better health care and because of longevity the number of people over 75 years of age living within the European Union requiring more personal care and attention has risen . #% Madam President , first I wish to compliment the rapporteur Mr Novo for his excellent report . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for a very comprehensive reply , and it seems to me that everything is going to be perfect after this Association Agreement is concluded . #% There are , however , some negative developments . #% However , it is important to note the dangers involved in ` soft law ' approaches to labour standards . #% This is not the end of the debate : this is a debate on a Green Paper and is the beginning of what I think will be a fairly long debate . #% Under the new CAP , the risk and crisis measures that we had all become used to were dismantled and the onus on the protection , prevention and management of crises has shifted squarely onto the farmers ' shoulders . #% Are we to be the victims of our own success ? #% Energy efficiency is an important priority . #% Mr President , Mr De Rossa mentioned me in particular and challenged me to an argument . #% Mr President , most people speaking here today talk about how ` the precautionary principle must be respected , but ... ' . #% We all too often have a tendency in Parliament , I am afraid , when we can not to do anything more concrete , to set up another institution . #% The aim of this legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases . #% The setting up of this new Radioactive Trains Investigative Committee will hear evidence from British Nuclear Fuels and Railtrack , as well as from representatives from local community groups on this very issue . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Jackson for her work . #% This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it . #% They are the largest man-made radioactive emissions and pollutants and do not pollute just EU Member States but migrate across the globe . #% No-fly zones should be established immediately around the two reprocessing plants in the EU : Sellafield and Cap de la Hague . #% We must all recall that the European Parliament has the power of codecision on environmental matters as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% Unlike Mr van Velzen , I support very strongly the rapporteur ' s amendment raising the percentage of savings to 1.5 % above what would happen anyway . #% It is inadequate in some respects because large areas of income are excluded . #% I welcome the intention of the Commission to extend the scope of the 1992 directive on the control of illicit narcotics to include precursors used in the manufacture of these new drugs . #% I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban . #% New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale . #% Whoever Mr Söderman 's replacement might be , and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way , he will have a lot to live up to . #% Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement . #% This case is a test of the movement 's sincerity , of its repeated disavowal of criminal activity in all its forms -- or are they just more weasel words ? #% I want to say in relation to BSE that farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% I was at the Conference of Presidents meeting which took the decision that there was no substance to the allegations being presented , and that it was right that President Barroso should respond by letter . #% The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward . #% I will ask for a report on the effects of Rohypnol in the United States . #% The Liberal Group wants two things from the Commission : that it should , in the short - to medium-term , try to improve the problems and shortcomings of the current system ; also , it should continue to deepen its work on moving the system to a new regime using the point of origin . #% However , this should be seen as one step in the process , not the end of the process , because we must move on to an Intergovernmental Conference , we must get the approval of the 25 governments and there will be changes within that process . #% I should like to place on the record how pleased we are to have a new member today who signs on our behalf . #% I must say that I disagree fundamentally with Mr Crowley . #% In particular , we must defend the advances we have made in the constitution on this matter . #% We should note , in my view , with alarm the reluctance of young people to take up farming and ponder the consequences for food security and employment in the agricultural food sector . #% Might I suggest to President Simitis that I could recommend no place better than Platy Yialos and he would know what I mean when I say that . #% Could I plead with the Commission , the Council and indeed the summit to be sure that decision is respected in what they say and in the signals they give . #% 
As John F Kennedy said in his inaugural speech ` we stand today on the edge of a new frontier , but the new frontier is not a set of promises , it is a set of challenges . ' #% Finally , small programmes and small initiatives can be very useful . #% It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union . #% It is a great credit to these soldiers and to the Iranian Government that they have tried to stem the flow of heroin destined for the streets of Europe . #% Mr President , I am against this amendment . #% Who knew of the difficulties in Equitable Life and when ? #% It is a complete cop-out because the testing ban is just going to ensure that EU multinationals will carry out animal testing outside the EU but the products will still be for sale here . #% Coming from an Objective 1 region in the west of Ireland , I believe that we should have the benefit of hearing what the President-in-Office has in mind regarding future plans for this very important area , particularly since a transition period is required for Objective 1 regions , which would utilise all the benefits that have come from the funds that have been received . #% The MRL problem gives rise to greatest concern in these minor food-producing species , such as horses , goats , rabbits , fish , bees - minor in terms of their economic importance for the pharmaceutical companies , hence their lack of defence of the various veterinary products required . #% This issue is now before the courts in Ireland . #% We will be opposing one amendment , but supporting the overall report . #% A patent for these techniques has been granted in the UK since August of 1995 . #% Furthermore , the proposed price cuts without full compensation would have a devastating impact on Irish farming in particular and the Irish economy in general . #% in writing . - In this era of commercialisation and professionalism , agents are unavoidable aspects of the sporting landscape . #% Mr President , I want to make it clear that this should not be an inquiry into the disaster off the Spanish/French coast : it concerns the safety of the entire European coastline . #% One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food . #% We have provided the financial control to deal with that . #% Ryanair has developed Charleroi airport from being a deserted field to catering for over two million passengers a year . #% Cabin crew are the only safety professionals with dual responsibilities . #% It goes without saying that the European Parliament must support a whole raft of measures to control environmental pollution in order to comply with its obligations under the Kyoto Agreement to reduce the level of European Union emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 % by the years 2008-2012 . #% If it abolished VRT Irish motorists would have to bear the costs of its abolition by paying a 20 cent increase in the price of petrol or diesel , or an increase from EUR 400 to EUR 900 in their annual motor tax . #% Mr President , I should like to add my thanks for the Commissioner 's excellent work over the past five years and to wish him well in his future career . #% The motion goes on to say ` with or without speaking rights ' . #% If there is a problem now with an interim Commission that has lost its moral and political authority to act , the problem arises , in my view , because of the failure of the Council to listen to Parliament and to appoint an effective interim Commission . #% It happens to us all . #% We should fully recognise that the Palestinians and the Israeli Government are now negotiating on bottom line issues , including the status of Jerusalem , the borders of the Palestinian State , the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees . #% However , we are glad to see that this has gone through . #% Others may make the case for reintroducing a zero quota if they wish , but as it stands , it makes no sense . #% Firstly , biofuels help to reduce over-dependence on oil-based fuels , which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and the Commission for its contribution this evening . #% If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy . #% We show no sign of implementing this in practice and it is clearly not possible to achieve success without clear objectives , targets , incentives and sanctions . #% The islands off the coast of Ireland have played and continue to play an important role in preserving the Irish culture and economy . #% Mr President , the Italians have an expression which I have always loved tutto il mondo e i paesi and today we are talking about a variety of legislation relating to what is clearly one of the most passionately debated and in many cases inadequately legislated for issue in our Community . #% We now need a sustained debate on Nice . #% I sincerely wish it all success in Dublin and in its concluding days . #% Rather , money from Axis I should be ring-fenced and targeted to the agricultural community , which is directly involved in farming . #% Mr President , what is happening now was predicted well before the vote . #% The report that we are dealing with today identifies a number of key reforms which in the view of the Petitions Committee need to be carried out if we are to ensure the democratic functioning of the European Union . #% It is unenforceable , and that makes an ass of the law . #% You , President-in-Office , have proved your ability and skill in building up the relationship with Russia . #% I am surprised that there were only 47 votes in favour of this amendment , despite the fact that even my own country of Ireland complains about it . #% No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right . #% It is important to remember , however , that Articles 175 and 176 do not give Member States a free hand to introduce whatever measures they want . #% Every single action taken is not taken in an exclusive format or by one person , but goes through a host of motions and a series of individuals and organisations before a final decision is reached . #% Mr President , I returned recently , with some colleagues from the Group of the Party of European Socialists , from a trip to China , including Tibet . #% I am not in favour of people like Alex Falconer jumping up and down every time there is a roll-call vote . #% The proposal before us today is intended to replace existing European Union directives which govern this important energy policy matter . #% Let us be very clear about what this is all about : not just democracy and human rights . #% I believe the undignified delay is the primary cause of all this concern and therefore , if we have political anger , while we are entitled to feel and express that anger , we should direct it at those who have caused the delay : that is most certainly not you and it is not the office of the Presidency of the European Parliament . #% I hope the outdated mind-set of the past will not stand in the way of the relief of so many in the future . #% Therefore we will be voting as groups against that amendment . #% It is discussed in Daíl Éireann and is a key component of our annual budget . #% It would be a travesty if , as a result of late payments , we were to undo all that good work . #% - I would like to first congratulate those who have drafted and voted on Directive 98/44/EC which is a step forward in the protection of the human being . #% No two situations involving displaced persons are the same . #% As they did that , they eroded the divisions of centuries and as a result the new Europe has evolved and is still evolving . #% I have serious doubts about this . #% It is not yet clear if any decisive moves will be taken in 1996 to start serious work on what the Maastricht Treaty describes as the eventual framing of a common defence policy . #% However , in recent decades there has been increasing criticism of the way the UN does business , the way it spends its money and the type of results it is getting or not getting . #% This applies not only to the workplace and job market but also to access to , and supply of , goods and services . #% Is there anything you can do to help us ? #% I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament . #% Who gains ? #% So there are no stocks out there waiting to be exploited . #% Therefore , on that basis we do not wish it to be moved and will vote against it . #% 
Mr President , if ever I doubted the validity of my Euroscepticism , today I discovered that 45 turgid minutes of Eurofanaticism from the Prime Minister of Belgium was the perfect antidote . #% My colleague Mr Stevenson has been complaining bitterly about the fact that we are dealing with something that is already in effect . #% At a time when markets are volatile , it can be the cost of a prospectus that would put someone off even trying to raise additional capital . #% The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations . #% This is an area of European policy that a lot of citizens are very worried about . #% If there is one thing that the European Parliament and the European Union have achieved , it is that ideal of respecting the dignity of difference . #% But let us celebrate what has been achieved so far . #% The reality of the terrible experience facing many immigration and asylum seekers is revealed in eight people dead and others who are seriously ill . #% If you stick a funnel down a goose 's throat and force-feed it with maize , there is no way that you are not causing suffering or injury . #% Maybe you agree with what this or that side is saying , but we would like to know where you stand . #% We are in real danger of adding an extra layer of victimization for many of these women who are being brought into the trafficking net by being offered work opportunities in the EU as au pairs , domestic workers or as waitresses . #% I fully support what he says . #% However it is very important that any codes of practice which are drawn up by EU airlines are fully evaluated and monitored to ensure that they are rigorously enforced . #% Finally , I fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on Article 5 ( 4 ) . #% An example of this would be the cooperation that was put in place for the different Member States of the EU concerning the fight against SARS last year . #% As has been said by another speaker , it is not correct to have a clause like this regarding the Court of Justice and a decision that must be taken there . #% The comments and the good wishes offered to him are well-merited because , in my experience , no one has done more to ensure a quicker , effective presidency than Ireland 's Minister for European Affairs . #% However , we do not believe it is possible for the EU to set adequate pension levels or , indeed , to harmonise retirement ages . #% Criminal sanctions should be used against those responsible for the environmental pollution caused by deliberate dumping and by maritime disasters . #% With regard to sustainability , the rising price of oil and fuel in recent months has sent shockwaves through each and every economy , as well as shocking private consumers . #% It was an honour for my party to be given the rapporteurship . #% Would the Commissioner just comment on that as an area where the new Commission should certainly take an interest , since , if consumers are to have accurate information , we need to tighten up on labelling . #% Training is often deficient , and for young people it can be an isolated life in rural areas , with limited social activity in comparison with those of a similar age who work in more urban settings . #% Their order books are full for a few more years , but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work on PROGRESS , a new and comprehensive structure for social solidarity . #% I am certainly taken aback by the President-in-Office 's response . #% I agree fully with those who expressed their reservations today in relation to the Commission proposals on the cereals sector . #% So that is not a single market : no competition there , no help to the consumer . #% The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies , rather the EU 's competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Environment Committee , I welcome Mr Maat 's excellent report . #% We hope very much that this conference will raise the issue again and bring to it the urgent attention that is needed . #% I also want to thank the Commission for starting this discussion , which is certainly very timely . #% We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year , now we get a promise of a Green Paper . #% Included in this plan must be a comprehensive and integrated proposal that deals with the issue of eliminating the use of landfill sites in Ireland in the medium to long term . #% Certainly , the auctioning of these licences in Germany and Britain has secured large amounts of money for the respective national exchequers , but who ultimately is going to pay for these phones ? #% And the man who ordered the killing still struts the streets of Belfast in the company of the IRA 's chief of intelligence , Bobby Storey , and leading provisional IRA man , Eddy Copeland . #% Therefore we have voted to ask that in adopting future selection criteria , in the case of the UK the Commission should take into account industrial change , GDP and the relationship between falling unemployment rates and non-sustainable employment in low-paid , part-time sectors . #% We are coming up with a programme which highlights key areas for research but at the same time expresses the wishes of the citizens of Europe for scourges like cancer and other illnesses and for environmental dangers to be combated with intelligence . #% I will speak English when I have to , to explain , but my own language comes first . #% It is in this year 's guidelines ; it was in last year 's guidelines ; it was in the guidelines the year before and it was in the Delors White Paper . #% We must ensure that throughout all of those public prosecutors ' offices there is the necessary understanding of what the European Union 's financial interests are . #% The support project for Northern Ireland for peace and reconciliation is a model of grass-roots activism and could be a model for this particular proposal here in listening closely to the grass roots and giving them support . #% I believe that the development of European tourism is inextricably linked to the development of transport and infrastructure across the EU . #% Many investors were bankrupted , some committed suicide and we need to know why , who was at fault and why there was a delay in the implementation of European Union law . #% I know from the excellent work done by the South Midlands Renewable Energy Centre , the only one in the United Kingdom , that if we go out with the message that renewable energy helps the environment and helps jobs , we get public support . #% From an Irish perspective , we are deeply concerned about the safety and security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria . #% Perhaps the strongest contributing factor to the likelihood of current and future human rights abuses and war crimes is the fact that , in the past , persons of power have been allowed to act with impunity , with no fear of prosecution or trial under international law . #% It is my understanding that the EU and the Court of Justice have stated that laws relating to abortion are dealt with at national level only and that the EU has no competence in this area . #% Mr President , on 28 October three United Nations aid workers were kidnapped in Afghanistan . #% In America 's hour of need , after the 11 September attacks , Europe responded with unstinting support and solidarity , and rightly so . #% I recall interviewing a feed compounder at that time who had no idea where most of his ingredients were coming from , because the word traceability had not been invented . #% Let me begin by saying that the Greens support the proposal of the Commission for both the FIFG and the MAGP . #% This is a modern state-of-the-art multi-million plant . #% I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso González on her excellent report . #% Outside the EU , where F-gas technology will remain mainstream , the service networks for such systems will simply not exist . #% We have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the Rapid Reaction Force . #% Researchers have even likened the long-term use of Internet pornography to the devastating effects of heroin . #% We now have 18 months in which to spend it , and I am calling tonight on our local Minister in Ireland , the Minister for Enterprise Coughlan , to personally intervene and see that there is a plan in place to spend the money . #% It is a disgrace that in Ireland we are still waiting for the rollout of a national breast screening programme . #% US Secretary of Defense , Donald Rumsfeld , is proclaiming that Iraq is giving refuge to al-Qa ` ida terrorists . #% Women are not encouraged at school level , they face discrimination in their careers , and this is something which we have to tackle in the European Research Area . #% With the help of European Union structural fund investment in tourism projects in recent years , it has been possible to record significant advances in the tourism sector . #% We in the Committee on Regional Affairs are very concerned at the lack of transparency in the document that you have adopted , the draft communication about the coherence of structural policies and competition . #% I hope it will improve confidence and the functioning of the single European market and eliminate unfair payment practices . #% This , I feel , was appropriate in these times of crisis when ordinary workers are suffering huge pain with cutbacks . #% The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start-up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business . #% 
I think that each of us has to come to this debate and to this argument from the basis of guaranteeing maximum opportunities for employment , maximum opportunities for social protection and maximum opportunities for forward-planning with regard to pension needs . #% That is the issue I invite the Commissioner to address when he replies in this debate . #% The OECD has estimated that in the 1990s governments in Europe transferred about EUR 300 billion of public-service property to private operators , in some cases with disastrous results in terms of both service provision and , indeed , loss of life . #% That is why , with the backing of many of the children ' s organisations across the European Union , we are calling for a number of actions . #% After more than 40 years of terrorism , violence and conflict all parties are now working towards a lasting peace in Ireland . #% For this reason the Labour MEPs have voted against this #% This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner . #% The group which I am part of in the European Parliament , the S&D , wholly endorses the ` Active and Healthy Ageing ' pilot European Innovation Partnership and puts forward suggestions for two additional partnerships in the areas which would benefit urgently from the created value added . #% In the context of the Agenda 2000 proposals price reductions can only be supported if they are accompanied by full payment to farmers so as to offset the effects of the proposed price reductions . #% In fact , if you look around the European Union and look at the countries which have done well over the years , the ones which have created a lot of jobs and given their people higher standards of living , they are all the countries which have pursued sound money policies . #% Once the new budgetary procedure begins next September , I will be seeking support once again for such a move . #% With most other Member States not taking their fair share of immigration under the 2004 enlargement , would countries like mine , the United Kingdom , not be wholly justified in refusing to extend their present open-door policy to Romania and Bulgaria ? #% Mr Bouwman mentioned that middle-aged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them . #% This flight closes at 7.05 pm , so therefore Mr Martin was claiming that in 1 Hour and fifty minutes I would have plenty of time to collect my belongings and drive approximately 250 kilometres to Frankfurt airport . #% I imagine it is the same in Scotland as it is on the west coast of Ireland - a serious mistrust exists . #% At present , the Member States must contain a level of oil stocks equivalent to 90 days ' consumption for each of the three main categories of petroleum products for energy use . #% The model for decision-making within the Union dates back , in part , to when the European Economic Community was a six-Member organisation in the late 1950s . #% I have strong suspicions that multi-annual programmes have operated in a discriminatory fashion without producing any major benefits to the fishing sector as a whole . #% I most certainly hope and believe that it is against every objective and principle of the Commissioner 's directive that a Member State should be allowed to manipulate what is essentially an EU social benefit in this way . #% As you yourself know , Taoiseach , those in Ireland who are critical of the EU are so mainly because of the military implications of this Constitution . #% We all know that the enlargement process can not take place unless there is some internal reform in the decision-making processes within the EU . #% First of all I would like to thank my colleague for her response to my letter about the Parliament magazine and to say that the article was in fact subsequently printed in full : I am satisfied with that . #% Liberalisation is certainly inevitable ; it has got to come . #% Funding to improve people 's access to basic health and education must be ring-fenced by including a clear benchmark . #% Where they think this expenditure of finance can be maximised to a better reaching of the objective and target of these regulations , then we should have the information before us so as to give us a good , healthy and proper debate . #% Mr President , as the European Union 's Chief Election Observer during the 2000 and 2001 elections , I witnessed at first hand the terrible consequences of violence in Sri Lanka . #% However , could the 54 % increase announced today by the Ombudsman be connected to the fact that a lot of Members of the European Parliament were in election mode and generating publicity ? #% As Irish republicans , following in the tradition of Bobby Sands MP , we are committed to the politics of equality , justice and freedom . #% This should allow animal production practices to be adopted and the antibiotics to be replaced by alternative products . #% We have taken an initiative across the various political groups , which we presented in February to President Prodi . #% It is our job to respond and ensure that our legislative framework in the EU can deliver competition and consumer benefits . #% The Ombudsman 's office clearly has resolved many problems , but it has not been in a position to resolve them all . #% To achieve a better understanding between the institutions is important , but I want to underline that this is just an interim agreement . #% However , if the Council does not significantly consult and include Parliament when putting its report together in the coming year , we will have to revert to our previous approach . #% I very much hold the view that there should be no escape for Mr Milosevic and that at some stage he must face the charges of war crimes in a court of law . #% Ireland ' s economic success is not solely down to the EU , as many economic experts will tell you . #% The fifteen governments of the Union should also be in a position to freeze the assets of terrorists and those involved in organised and international crime . #% If adopted , this model will simultaneously result in the collapse of stocks and the collapse of the market . #% A failure on our part to face political realities honestly and objectively undermines our ability to exert influence in bringing this bloody and terrible conflict to an end . #% Yesterday , a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland . #% The American Government talks about saving civilisation - a 200-year-old civilisation or a 5000-year-old civilisation ? #% Some measures might turn out to be superficial ; others might need to be more efficient . #% Sharing information in these areas can only be beneficial . #% Terrorism is a huge threat to all of us and to all of our citizens and it is something that has to be fought in the years ahead . #% We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens . #% Frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms . #% I particularly welcome the putting in place of rules which seek to guarantee that food imported from outside the Union must meet with the same rigorous standards that apply to producers within the EU . #% Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , I sympathise totally with the position that many German farmers find themselves in at the present time . #% There is a great danger that the European Union institutions will respond in a piecemeal manner to these appalling issues of violence towards children . #% But there is a message for Northern Ireland as well : accelerate the uptake and help those of us fighting for your cause in this House to be justified by next December in asking the Minister - I know that his and his government 's good will is there - to back a realistic and fair package for Northern Ireland , which we will vote on Thursday . #% We need to look at the location of water and how infrastructures could be used . #% I should say that the United Kingdom presidency brought with it great enthusiasm , energy and a high quality of organizational ability which we all very much appreciate . #% As far as Mr Alyssandrakis ' report is concerned , I would welcome a breakthrough in fusion research , not least because it is far less dangerous than nuclear fission and we need to have an alternative to that form of energy . #% I do not have to say any more . #% What we are discussing here today is the revision of the original 1993 regulation which put in place the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme . #% Finally , the expiry of the ECSC Treaty after 50 years reminds us that the Euratom Treaty , which has also existed outside the democratic scrutiny and control of this Parliament , is an anomaly as more and more Member States are moving away from nuclear energy and towards new forms of energy and that this anomaly , which happily will end with the Coal and Steel Community , still continues with the Euratom Treaty . #% Madam President , I too should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the Jackson report . #% I thank the President-in-Office for the continuing support , particularly for investment in Northern Ireland . #% It is necessary constantly to review regulation in this area , as new scientific evidence and testing is constantly being developed . #% in writing . - I voted against this resolution , which states the position of the European Parliament ahead of the initialling of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , because the conservative majority in this House refused to raise the need for basic safeguards for our citizens vis-à-vis this global copyright agreement . #% Where will the growth come from and , consequently , where will the jobs come from ? #% Sadly , the totalitarian despot , Mr Milosevic , is fuelling the flames of genocide and compounding the misery of the Kosovar Albanians . #% I have always believed that Turkey 's accession would provide an important bridgehead between the West and the Islamic world . #% I welcome the cooperation you have outlined and the special attention which will be given to nuclear installations . #% 
Mr President , I just wish to say that there is very little point in spending time debating and adopting environmental legislation if it is not going to be implemented . #% Madam President , I hope that the new President will treat all Members equally . #% I welcome its recent conversion and I hope that it is successful in blocking this measure . #% But this , too , must add a new urgency for the Council and the Commission in respect of an EU-led political initiative to resolve the Cyprus problem under the aegis of the United Nations lest , again , we should institutionalise inside the Union an intractable and difficult problem on that divided island . #% This whole point has a lot of merit . #% What more can one add ? #% Regulation has to be maintained by having a strong public service element . #% His only recourse is to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . #% We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence-building mechanism . #% It was not uncommon for farmers -- and these are not large farms -- to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry . #% I thank him for his response with regard to the chemical industry and also to the agreements established in Central America , the Caribbean and Latin America and the forthcoming agreement with Asia . #% Does it not fly in the face of wanting to persuade Member States to be more responsible and , if they are more responsible , allow them to be ? #% The fact of the matter is that long-term unemployment and youth unemployment is quite concentrated in particular areas within the European Union . #% I do not think we should . #% Article 175 has inbuilt safeguards ( in Article 176 EC ) against unilateral trade distorting decisions that may be protectionist in nature rather than environmentally justifiable . #% Mr President , as has already been said a number of times , the Irish `` no '' was not a `` no '' to enlargement . #% To earn the same as a man would earn on average for a calendar year , a woman on average must work until the end of the following February , a total of 418 days . #% If you want to know why Europe is unpopular in many areas of the European Union , just look at this type of proposal . #% Moreover , it expresses the intention , in cases of a flagrant violation of European Union waste legislation , of inviting the responsible ministers of the relevant Member States to attend a committee meeting of the European Parliament to explain their policies . #% It is an important confirmation by Parliament that Nice is necessary to facilitate a successful enlargement process . #% We must have a proper mechanism in place to ensure that , if a national court is not able or willing to bring a case against somebody who is accused of crimes against humanity , then there must be an international forum to do so . #% I also had the honour of meeting many of the human rights activists in Colombia last year . #% I am a great supporter of the Enlargement process , not only because of our responsibility to our fellow Europeans who suffered under totalitarian regimes but also because I believe that the new accession countries will bring a wonderful dynamic to the future development of the European Union . #% In the Union 's message to the Serbian people last September the foreign minister said that the Union promised that a vote for democracy in Serbia would be a vote for Serbia in Europe . #% The waters east of Canada have seen fishing vessels from Spain , France and England for hundreds of years . #% Decoupling is a central tenet and is quite revolutionary in itself . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it . #% We can distribute responsibility around the various Member States , but we must have a coordinated policy . #% The document should therefore command a consensus if it is an accurate reflection of these views . #% Then the fishermen of Greenland , Ireland and perhaps the Azores as well , began to see what might have been . #% That is understood by Parliament 's Committee on Budgets and I want to emphasize here tonight that every effort was made , particularly by the chair of that committee , to help in the process of obtaining more money for research . #% Unless we give real information in a very public manner then we can not benefit from these groupings . #% Madam President , I welcome this debate . #% The Baltic Sea issue was a very contentious one dealt with by the committee in harmony with other committees of the Parliament . #% This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well . #% I commend him for the extensive work he has put into the preparation and completion of this report and I share his view that we need to stress the important role of EURES network , as a means of implementing European employment strategy . #% If they had produced what they were asked to this time , it would be the smallest piece of paper with the least written on it of anything produced because the intentions for investment in Western Europe in nuclear power are practically nil . #% No one , I repeat , wants to encourage fraud ; certainly we in this Parliament would not in any way want to encourage fraudulent acts and where they are found they must be dealt with very severely . #% This question asks the Commission if it is attempting to mainstream the social protection and inclusion process in the provision of medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 332/2002 . #% Finally , we already have in place in the transport sector tachograph requirements which are rigorously enforced in all Member States and which may be one way of dealing with some of the concerns about the health and safety aspect . #% Registration should be made mandatory and the Council should also join this agreement as soon as possible . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Swedish presidency on being very successful . #% It seems to me that if a vice-president of the ACP Joint Assembly and Mrs van Bladel , a vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and five members of the Portuguese Parliament are prevented from visiting Angola , there is something radically wrong in that region . #% However , as others have said , the effectiveness or otherwise of this proposal as a means of reducing air traffic noise will only be known after the Commission has submitted its report on its findings in over five years ' time . #% I know that Commissioner Bolkestein is sensitive to this issue . #% Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by a gang of thugs and criminals masquerading as Republican political activists or IRA freedom fighters . #% The Commission 's decision to reform the sugar industry and to cut the supports it paid to growers never favoured the Irish sugar industry . #% Mr President , the report we are discussing here today is very much an interim report into the collapse of Equitable Life Assurance Society in Britain . #% Is he going to dismiss them and refuse to accept their advice or opinions any more ? #% The core elements and goals are still as valid today as they were when it was first agreed : to make Europe the most dynamic and innovative economy in the world by 2010 . #% Does that mean that we are to expect a modified regulation or simply a modified proposal on the performance reserve ? #% We import 70 % of our organic needs and again I have to refer to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland , because there are over 70 countries listed . #% The secretariat was originally all in Dublin , though in recent years an antenna was opened in Brussels to carry out relations with the EU institutions . #% It has an upside and a downside , the witness protection scheme . #% The common theme running through them all is the effect that the excessive amount of fishing capacity has on European fisheries . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report . #% I call , therefore , for the programme to be gradually opened to all countries covered by the EU 's Neighbourhood Policy . #% Finally , I would like to thank the Chairman for accepting our point on the protocol for the movement of non-susceptible animals and , in particular , the promise of a review of the movement of equines during future outbreaks , as horses are not susceptible in this case . #% As the EU has both one of the largest fishing fleets and one of the largest markets for fish , it can play a particularly important role in regard to flags of convenience fishing . #% This is very timely , when new information technologies are ensuring that small , medium and large enterprises within the Union will now have to change their administrative structures . #% Given the major changes in the political context in which it operates , especially as the enlargement process gains momentum , it is time to evaluate and update elements of it as we prepare for its third phase . #% Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed . #% Targeted EU spending is one way in which we can boost local economies and bring jobs to our communities . #% We need to get to grips with our different world views . #% The current minimum standard rate of VAT fixed at 15 % is due to end at the end of this year . #% The issues , arising from multi-billion-euro losses in the '80s and the '90s , many related to asbestos , can only be dealt with satisfactorily through the establishment of a committee of inquiry . #% 
On the issue of controls , this is something that relates not only to this issue but also to a vast area of legislation in the European Union , where legislation is in place but it is not enforced ; there are no controls . #% All too often , when we talk about globalisation , our comments and concerns centre solely on trade , rather than on the social aspects of globalisation . #% Madam President , the key aim of the EU 's detergent policy has been to safeguard the single market in these products and , above all , to ensure a high level of environmental and human protection . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating not only our own representatives at the Convention but also the Convention as a whole for the tremendous work which it has carried out . #% The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% Is the Council aware of this study ? #% Because of illegal actions by the few , there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals . #% EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research , banned in four Member States , my own country included . #% In quarries six miles apart , one in Dundalk and the other in Newry , a European directive is being implemented differently in two Member States . #% Europe needs to reform its economies , and all countries should do that . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to add my thanks to Mrs Roth-Berendt and indeed Mr Böge for their commitment to this important issue . #% From an agricultural perspective , Mr Olsson has addressed the challenge of enlargement in a reasoned and practical way . #% There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality . #% Without the cooperation of all the members of the Employment Committee , we could not have arrived at the unanimous decision that underpinned the amendments that are going forward to the Council . #% We only caught , apparently , an average of 3 000 tonnes , and yet we are increasing the number of vessels being sent there . #% I welcome the resolution from the spring summit to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator . #% The other 719 Members may not yet know how Charlie operates and they deserve a chance to see what they are in for . #% I have no difficulty with the other two . #% These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush 's hit list . #% However , in order to secure the trust and commitment of Europe 's agricultural community , the new CAP needs to offer stability to farmers and a fair price , as is currently provided , for the goods which they produce . #% To maintain a disease-free status a country has to be free of FMD for at least 12 months , an effective system of surveillance must be in place and all regulatory measures for the prevention and control of FMD must have been implemented . #% In widening the European Union rather than deepening it and in making it more democratic and diversified rather than more bureaucratic and centralized lies the best way forward for all the people of Europe . #% So for all these reasons it is important to guarantee that we control the supervisory measures over nuclear materials . #% The conference should make clear that it rejects all attempts to undermine the competitive advantage enjoyed by developing countries in the matter of wage rates . #% This is also the mindset which makes our Environmental Protection Agency a rubber stamp of approval for even the dirtiest business , no matter how damaging it is to the environment ; a mindset that opens Ireland to toxic industries like incineration , which Irish people do not want . #% The proposal is limited to introducing a simplification into the operations of the European Social Fund to encourage the effective , efficient and fast uptake of available resources , without compromising the principles of sound financial management . #% The basic conclusion of the review conducted by the Commission was that the control programmes in the Member States were totally inadequate and in dire need of improvement . #% Well done to you Taoiseach , and to your team . #% We seriously require support through the industry : decommissioning , a reduction in size of the fishing fleet and fishing time so that we can at least leave those left in the industry some hope of survival . #% Globally , according to the FAO , millions of tonnes of unwanted fish by-catch are thrown back into the sea each year . #% One of the major components of the political dialogue is the subject of this report , namely democratisation , the protection of human rights and the operation of the rule of law . #% If the Commission is taking legal action against Member States it would seem that the interests or the protection of Member States are given priority by the Commission and that we basically end up with a situation where citizens throughout the European Union are going to be accusing the Commission of being extremely secretive and protecting the interests of the Member States . #% The finance ministers have merely been asked to draw up another report on ways of adjusting the tax system . #% In particular , the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers , who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports . #% It is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey . #% I hope these very positive moves will translate into practice on the ground very soon . #% I also deplore their attitude towards the Rational Planning Directive which is a piece of legislation which would allow us seriously to tackle the question of energy efficiency in the distribution sector . #% If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it . #% This helper could not lift , could not put his hand above his head , could not in fact do anything that a carer had to do . #% That was an enormous misinterpretation by the Iraqis and they suffered the consequence . #% I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme . #% The modes of transportation are likewise , in my opinion , of the highest quality and standards . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office , finally , if he and his Council recognise the outcome of democratic elections within this Union ? #% I think there is general agreement that significant progress has been made . #% In the United States petrol costs less than bottled mineral water . #% However , the point I raised is exceptional . #% Finally , I support and commend your approach towards promoting external affairs . #% In the report , we stressed the importance of job consolidation and maintenance , just as we stressed the importance of job creation . #% The other sad fact is that this Parliament does not really have the moral high ground to condemn nuclear tests after our failure on the whole issue of France 's nuclear tests and nor does the Commission because the Commission sat on its hands when it had the power to do something and it did not do anything ! #% The United States and Japan are jumping into markets : huge contracts recently signed in China and India by American companies for photovoltaic arrays . #% The European Union 's stated aim is to consolidate and strengthen the global relief effort . #% If Kohl or Mitterrand had been at the table last weekend , we would have had a conclusion . #% I regret to say that I believe that is the only language that will be understood and that will lead to a resolution of this particular crisis . #% Without proper pre-treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water , as well as polluting the air . #% We should call for freedom of expression and assembly and international solidarity with workers in China to fight this horrific bureaucratic regime , many of whose members aspire to be oligarchs , obviously , as they did previously with the same system in Russia . #% In most countries of the Union - by way of contrast with the strategic petroleum reserve in America - security stocks are held by oil companies and are mixed with their operational stocks . #% I found that I could not continue to read . #% This is one part of the European research area . #% With regard to the WTO , could you comment on the difference between free trade and fair trade ? #% I welcome Mrs d'Ancona 's proposed visit to Holloway Prison . #% I regret the intolerant anti-European rejection of subsidiarity by some colleagues this afternoon . #% In relation to Supplementary and Amending Budget Number 3 of this year , I would like to refer to an amendment which I tabled on behalf of my group , UEN , at the Budget Committee but which unfortunately was not accepted . #% It is obvious from the testing that has been taking place , at least in my own country , that all of the younger animals and animals over 30 months that have been tested are not in any way reacting positively to the test . #% It is imperative that the work begins on the Dublin light transit system known as Luas before the millennium . #% I have no objection when we are talking about hazardous waste , because that always has to be controlled . #% Among the blessed , he mentions Ryanair , now the most profitable airline in Europe , more profitable as a percentage of turnover than the giant BA . #% 
Until that criminal activity is stopped definitively and the iron grip that the Republican movement exercises on various parts of Northern Ireland is ended , there is little possibility that ordinary citizens can hope to have their human rights vindicated . #% It is necessary to acknowledge that 98 % was properly spent . #% The spectacular rise in the volume of financial transactions in the global economy within the last decade , which , in 2007 , reached a level 73.5 times higher than nominal world GDP , illustrates the growing disconnection between financial transactions and the needs of the real economy . #% We will have to wait and see how it actually works in practice . #% Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste . #% We also make our businesses more competitive . #% Hun Sen has already decided who can and can not be taken before a tribunal , thus challenging the powers of any court . #% Sadly , the United Kingdom did not seek equal derogation , so we are beset with the foolish regulations I have described . #% That was very much appreciated by all of us across the Groups in this House . #% I welcome the general thrust of the proposal and share the aims which underpin it . #% While the European economy is performing strongly , we must also ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a society . #% I believe that technical advancement in other forms of energy , including perhaps nuclear fusion , make the future very unsure . #% The greatest risk is that this opt-out is extended to all Member States which would render regulation of Working Time redundant , resulting in a race to the bottom . #% Following on from Mr Titford 's comments , today I tried to contact an undertaker friend to see if he had anything he wished to add tonight , but it seems he is on his holidays somewhere , as it so happens . #% Do you want your children to be involved in industries that are responsible for the persecution and death of so many people around the world ? #% However , it also points to the fact that some Member States are more advanced than others , I believe we should also now focus on the new opportunities and new technologies available to us . #% I am particularly sympathetic to the situation in the Azores , where the dairy sector is very important and has had serious difficulties . #% I also want to welcome the positive response from the Commissioners . #% We will also recognise and appreciate in the future the stronger and greater links that you have established with the applicant countries , helping to foster democratic and parliamentary values there . #% In that regard I would ask the Commissioner to examine seriously whether or not Sellafield-THORP would come into that particular category . #% Since the beginning of your tenure , Commissioner Byrne , you have responded to the needs of the consumers of Europe by making every effort to improve the safety of the food chain . #% Madam President , Commission President , 1999 has been a difficult year for the mainstream EU institutions in that problems which surfaced over issues such as the accountability about the administration of various EU initiatives had strained relations between the European Parliament and the Commission . #% Not content with having precipitated the crisis , these parasites now want to exploit it to rake in further billions . #% That is why the safeguard clauses are there . #% The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States . #% It is not a partisan report . #% A human development approach to debt sustainability with highly indebted countries would mean that the first call on poor countries ' government resources would be expenditures needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals . #% Madam President , I would first like to thank the Commissioner for bringing forward the original document which is the base for this report . #% Indeed , as a Member of the European Parliament who represents the east coast of Ireland , this is an issue which is close to my heart . #% Why is it that we have failed to look at the structural problems that are causing people to drop out of education ? #% We are always an action plan away from action . #% I believe that the Commission too must recognise that the expanded remit of the codecision procedure means that Parliament has an equal say in the enactment of EU directives and regulations encompassing 38 different economic and social sectors . #% Maybe the answer will come from the next two speakers . #% It is high time that the EU took a moral stand on the situation in Burma . #% On a point of order , I apologise to the President-in-Office and to you , Mr President , that I was not here for my question . #% In Ireland successive governments have expressed their concern to UK governments concerning the accident rate at the BNFL institutions , particularly the accident rate at Sellafield on the UK 's least-populated west coast , only a few miles across from our most populated east coast . #% In conclusion , Mr President , for the record , Ireland has never been neutral nor could we afford to be . #% While I recognize that the problems of Corsica , Sardinia and some of the Greek islands are very specific , I would also like the Commission to recognize that there are small islands in my own country that could and should be considered for specific Community action . #% Your approach has been a breath of fresh air and will , I hope , reassure the candidate countries that we are indeed serious about this issue and have demonstrated as much during the Swedish presidency . #% I know that the proposed Consumer Rights Directive will deal with some issues , but cross-border air travel needs more European laws for the protection of consumers . #% As a direct result of this petition we have discovered some very alarming things about some gas heaters , including the fact that 61 people died in Belgium last year as a direct result of carbon monoxide poisoning from water heaters . #% They recognise that the quality of that food has improved over the years and , in spite of the fact that , from time to time we have scares and always will , the consumers of the European Union are relatively happy that we have given them a safe product . #% Unless the Commission brings forward a detailed analysis of the money required in order to enable the schools to do their job properly , either in providing the special needs education within the schools or providing that education outside of those schools , then we are failing as a Union , and , indeed , as an employer of the parents of these children . #% The solution to this problem may not be as hard as some EU airlines may envisage . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur . #% For the time being , support for the 7000-strong AU force is essential and the UN has agreed to give logistical and material support . #% In the past , as you know , Parliament and the Council have both essentially duplicated each other 's work to a certain extent by producing similar reports . #% The tabling of 1 200 amendments represents a serious divergence of views within Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism . #% It is essential that these concepts should not be enshrined in the Directive as it would open the way for abuses of all kind , and I feel the same applies to speeding up asylum procedures which could also downgrade the quality of the procedure . #% That is why I supported the LEADER initiative both now and in the past and why I support the new EU EQUAL job creation programme . #% We call on the Commission to put together a voluntary code of conduct , working with rather than lecturing to companies operating in repressive countries , in an effort to reduce the capacity to prevent freedom of expression . #% - There is doubt that the correct legal basis was used for this proposal . #% I have circulated to Members a list of those patients ' organizations who oppose the patenting of human gene sequences . #% However , the most important area which has been outlined during the Austrian Presidency has been one of realism , of doing things that are achievable , of not ignoring problems that are there and trying to build a consensus to try and solve them , as well as taking the sensible attitude that this can not be solved just in six months . #% In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining . #% So , moving on from language to what I consider to have been a very successful Irish presidency , I want to congratulate the Taoiseach , his ministers , and in particular Minister Cowen and Minister Roche , who is with the Taoiseach here today . #% It is notable that although both argue for alternative agricultural activity , both rapporteurs conclude that there has been no evaluation by the Commission . #% It is extremely important , if this House is to demonstrate its relevance to the lives of the citizens of Europe , that we should use our influence to save these jobs and to ensure that the Commission does not apply rigid , ideologically-based guidelines in the current situation . #% One such problem relates to the need to provide greater childcare facilities for women who take up jobs in rural parts of my country and indeed , throughout Europe . #% But - and I enter a very strong caveat here - it is very important for the effect of consolidation on competition and financial stability to safeguard prices in what will , de facto , be a less competitive arena . #% For that reason , it is our privilege here to raise our voices to demand that his life and the lives of those living in his community are protected and to make sure that the Colombian Government is aware of our concerns . #% However , taxation is solely a national interest issue . #% Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries . #% But how and when we get to this point of a ban should be a matter for all stakeholders involved , including the Commission , the regional advisory councils ( RACs ) , the fishermen , the scientific experts , the national governments and NGOs , and fishery by fishery if necessary . #% Equally scandalous is the attitude of the Council of Ministers towards SAVE II in its budgetary suggestions . #% 
In my view , despite the many criticisms , the vision of Europe 's founding fathers continues to be realised . #% It is all very well to have human rights agreements signed , but the reality is that no matter what efforts have been made in Algeria over the years by the Council and by the European Union , the situation , like in Turkey , has got worse instead of better . #% I accept that this strategy also has to be seen in the wider context of sustainable development requirements - that our current needs have to be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . #% Mr President , we welcome this proposal by the Commission to improve the system of control and I should like to thank Mr Casaca for his report . #% Records in this House will show that on a previous occasion I called on the Commission to exercise its powers under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to verification of nuclear installations at Sellafield . #% The current treaties already provide a way ; and if the Council wishes to add to that the spirit of Amsterdam , then we can proceed to an interim Commission appointment through that means . #% Members speak of between 90 days and 42 days , but some extradition proceedings that would have gone on for years between Member States of the European Union in the past have now been reduced to 42 days . #% I hope that the fund continues to treat , and will be seen to treat , all sides fairly . #% Parliament itself can not rid itself of part of the blame for this . #% As someone who has worked with young drug addicts and young alcoholics in the past , I know that nothing is more calculated to send out the wrong message than proposals calling for the legalisation of illegal substances . #% The more we shout about fraud and corruption , the less seriously we will be taken unless it is absolutely necessary and unless we know exactly what we are talking about . #% It is extremely important we have viable and traceable means to ensure that farmers observe any preslaughter waiting-time periods , in particular concerning recreational horses entering the chain for human consumption . #% This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean . #% Fortunately , there was a real sense in the committee that this must change , that priority must be given to approaches to treatment that enable people to achieve remission and recovery , as well as to inclusion , the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health . #% We have to find a resolution as quickly as possible to the present situation and , in the long term , we have got to improve our response mechanisms to this type of situation . #% It will now proceed in May 2004 , ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed , Mr President , during your final six months as President of this Parliament . #% In particular I would submit that it means nothing at all for the 18 million people who we have heard of so often this morning - our fellow European citizens who are without work . #% I think , with regard to the appeal , it would be a magnificent gesture if the Chinese Government , in an effort to try to repair the damage done to date , were to permit observers to attend this appeal . #% For how could Parliament 's Committee on Budgets discharge the budget without exercising its function to scrutinise the financial management and allocation of funds ? #% The European leaders in Göteborg will address two primary subjects , namely the enlargement of the European Union and how best to solve many of our environmental problems . #% My group commends in particular the progress made by the Baltic States , in the economic field in Lithuania and in human rights in Latvia . #% We have been to the fore with in bringing forward innovative programmes tackling common diseases such as cancer , biological hazards , risks to food and food safety , and also the ongoing problems of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease . #% I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that , in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland , Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon , one of the world 's biggest arms manufacturing companies . #% Road traffic in Dublin has grown exponentially in the last decade , as we have experienced record growth levels in our economy . #% The European Union 's development aid programmes should include programmes which seek to ensure that women can participate fully in society . #% Once the new European supervisory authority becomes fully functional , fund managers will not be able to market their products in the European Union unless they hold a European passport certifying full compliance with this directive . #% Mr President , this has been a week without precedent with the resignation en masse of the European Commission . #% It is time we acted . #% There is sufficient evidence that our competitors in the world market , particularly the United States and New Zealand , are not always as committed to adhering to the rules as are the EU Member States . #% Early-stage researchers benefit greatly from the practical support and advice from more experienced researchers . #% Indeed , following disclosure of a reaction , a special contiguous testing programme for herds adjoining restricted herds is operated . #% I am pleased that the members of the Greater London Assembly are now equally concerned by the shipment of radioactive nuclear materials in England and , in particular , to the BNFL Sellafield plant in Cumbria . #% I do not think anything the Irish presidency did halted efforts to make the European Union a military superpower or to stop the widening of the gap between rich and poor , which is the likely outcome of EMU . #% The local post office in rural communities is a vital economic , social and cultural institution and the rights of rural dwellers to postal services can not be ignored when framing liberalisation plans for those services in the EU . #% The freedom to live , work or study abroad must mean just that - freedom - and not hidden barriers . #% I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the survivors of this tragedy for the loss of their spouses and their children . #% I propose a significant boost in aid for trade , which would be aimed at helping developing countries help themselves by enabling them to turn market opportunities into reality . #% We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since ? #% One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties . #% Mr President , I first wish to join with others in offering my sympathy to the people of South-East Asia who have been so badly affected by this awful tragedy . #% That we expect of you . #% To address underdevelopment , the developed world needs to vigorously fight tax havens and illicit capital flows which deprive developing countries of resources they desperately need . #% Tomorrow , when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion , I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus . #% For example , our Foreign Minister said that he was quite happy with the decisions taken : he said that the interests of neutral countries were taken on board and that they were met within the opinion which was submitted by the EU Political Committee . #% Since the disaster in November 2002 , the issues of European maritime security and safety have been given a much higher priority on the European agenda . #% When debating this instrument , our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries , and in particular the poorest sections of their populations . #% The opening-up of larger markets will assist in the process of economic growth . #% Who do they want to replace him with ? #% We want to be active persuaders and influencers in doing more , hence our commitment to the convention idea . #% There will not be a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Union as a result of the enactment of the provisions of the Treaty . #% Groups campaigning against the arms trade have been very frustrated by this . #% It has been a fascinating and challenging experience for me to produce the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2004 and the EU 's policy on the matter . #% The UK , for example , has quite rightly conducted its own debate on stem cell research and come to the conclusion that a tightly regulated research programme can eventually bring benefits to sufferers of highly disabling and painful conditions . #% You have established , Taoiseach , beyond doubt - and in Ireland 's case , not for the first time - the capacity of smaller Member States to discharge their responsibilities to good effect , confounding many of those critics at Member State level who argue trenchantly for change . #% Through my work in Parliament I too have experienced the fact that so many children are deprived of the company and love of both their parents , very often due to selfishness and lack of understanding about the particular needs of children . #% We talk about food security in Europe ; if you want food security , we are giving it to you - we are giving you food safety . #% I draw your attention to Article 152 ( 5 ) which prevents Community action from affecting national provisions on the donation of blood . #% It is such a major trading partner that anything that would help us move and work closer together is very welcome . #% I also believe it will be an act of folly for Ireland to join EMU if Britain remains outside , as appears increasingly likely . #% Where dialogue does not take place , the gap is only filled by mutual misunderstandings and ritual condemnations and fear . #% - The vote on the fund which was tabled late by the Council was facilitated by the EP without debate , on the understanding from all groups including the Greens that there would be no amendments . #% This is an important debate and I would like to compliment the Commission on its publication of the White Paper on European Governance . #% Therefore it is vitally important that we do everything we can to facilitate further growth within that sector . #% We in the PSE Group will not support amendments on ethics , but we appreciate the declaration which has been brought forward . #% However it , together with any new constitutional treaty , will be the Treaty of the EU . #% What they are doing is reducing the rate of increase and we should underline that . #% 
The whole Union will become an impossible place if all the languages of the Union are to receive official status and be used in the whole conduct of the business of the Union . #% Unless you understand that , you will weaken the Commission . #% We have had the Tampere Summit . #% It is correct that Parliament voted down this compromise as it only sought to undermine agreements in Berlin . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their work and also the draftsmen from the various committees for their assistance on what is a very difficult area to legislate on . #% Madam President , as my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy . #% I find it incredible that the EU is not demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Famagusta to its inhabitants who are , incidentally , EU citizens . #% Why is it not possible to do a proper study based on the realities we face today ? #% We also need to follow through on existing dossiers , be it the services directive , the protection of public services or the right to universal service , and bring these into being . #% Rather than reiterate what other colleagues have said , I think the core issue is the junior doctors in training . #% We must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes . #% You can not have one without the other and when we speak about raising taxes , you can have the highest taxes in the world , but if you do not have companies employing people and paying taxes , then you can not provide social protection afterwards . #% Agreements are for the honourable ; the Janjaweed are not honourable . #% Similarly , in terms of the employment generated , preference should be given to vessels which provide most jobs relative to the amount of fish they catch . #% More disappointing is the naked party political games which British Members Mr Davies , Mr Bradbourn and Mrs Evans have attempted in this resolution . #% The RETT committee amendments are in line with the conclusions of the Musotto report , particularly on the need for a cohesion policy which will improve existing and future disparities between European regions in an enlarged Europe . #% The European fleet has shrunk . #% The area under afforestation is the size of England and Scotland . #% The likely accession of these countries will provide all Europe with a unique opportunity to work together for a peaceful and secure future . #% The work in the European Parliament has undoubtedly increased because of the Treaty of Lisbon . #% 380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission . #% In the interests of mankind we have a responsibility to keep searching for the right answers . #% This is unacceptable to mainstream science . #% In fact we have a moral obligation to do more than to warn young people , in particular teenagers , of the acute dangers of cigarette smoking for our health . #% It brings the Commission and the European project into disrepute with citizens who are otherwise not Eurosceptic at all . #% Well , here it is , sticking its nose over the horizon ; it 's time for you to prove your mettle . #% Mr President , I am somebody who generally supports the Common Agricultural Policy , so I hate to admit this in front of Terry Wynn , but I agree with some of the points he makes about the complications of the policy which have led to so many opportunities for fraud . #% Mr President , one of the clear messages from this report today is the need to introduce procedures which will simplify the Structural Funds payments regime in Europe . #% It is clear that Turkey has a key role to play in shaping the European Union of the future and we must do all in our power to guarantee that the new Turkish Government is given full support and encouragement in its desire to make their country meet the Copenhagen criteria so as to begin accession negotiations . #% However , the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the US in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science , and it pays off . #% The American founding father Benjamin Franklin once said that ` He who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither ' , and I believe that Europe would do well to heed this particular piece of advice over the coming months . #% in writing . - I welcome this report and the Commission 's intention to review the European standardisation system ; I hope they pave the way to a modern , integrated standardisation policy . #% The unit was launched in 1995 , when 12 images were seized . #% Mr President , I welcome this report by Mr Hutchinson on relocation in the context of regional development . #% I welcome what is before us here this evening . #% It is , frankly , the best fuel . #% I believe that the major decisions that have been made in respect of enlargement , reform and defence show that there is a sustained vitality in our common European vocation . #% However , there is an urgent need to review the Veterinary Medicines Directive according to the outcome of the task force on the availability of veterinary medicines . #% We have not been able to fill our quota this year because of the BSE crisis . #% You are destroying our services and the living standards of our people . #% If , as I fear , they show a dramatic improvement in Ireland 's economic performance , is there not a real danger that a major part of the newly designated Objective 1 region will no longer qualify ? #% The cooperative sector has been waiting 30 years for this legislation , because of the extremely diverse nature of this sector . #% I am in favour of the report , but I have specific concerns . #% Part of the reason for that seems to me to have been a piece of written advice that was circulated , which pre-empted my proposals by claiming that PPE policy had been decided . #% For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama . #% Can the Commissioner therefore tonight give his support for the continuation of a strong role for European assistance post-2006 for our urban and industrial restructuring regions as well as our poorest regions ? #% Although I agree with the demand that the Palestinian Authority make every effort to prevent terrorist acts , the question has to be asked how can they act when their political , security and civil infrastructures are being destroyed in an incessant military campaign which has claimed many innocent lives ? #% They have not been here , and I think they must bear the shame for it . #% The current directive has been amended five times since 1970 and has never been consolidated . #% For this reason local authorities strongly support EU leadership to ensure cross-European commitment by national governments to give funding and legislative support in this field . #% I would urge Commissioner Figeľ to put on the record tonight the Commission 's intention of doing so as soon as possible . #% I say this because now the European Union governments are discussing what I would describe as the bottom-line issues relating to areas of concern with regard to the likely provisions of the new European Union Treaty . #% Previous common positions have not yet been implemented in all Member States , while the threat posed to children 's safety by greater technological progress continues to mount . #% Finally , we must aggressively defend our interests on the international marketplace by basing our trading policy on the premise that overseas companies will only have access to our markets provided that we have equally good access to their home markets . #% The Declaration was made at the last minute and can not be considered a positive step in the process of adoption of Community legislation . #% Bad drafting leads to legal uncertainty , poor or confused transposition and at the end of the line is a confused businessman or consumer who loses confidence in the internal market . #% Irish consumer organisations are concerned about the possible inflationary implications of following other Member States in reducing the usage of these small coins or indeed withdrawing them . #% This resolution which , incidentally , is supported by the European Parliament and by my own country , Ireland , sets forth a new way of thinking for effective measures to forward the cause of a nuclear-free world . #% Commissioner Monti 's paper for Verona establishes clearly that tax on the low paid has gone up . #% We need to reaffirm what was agreed at the European Council in Madrid . #% Today there are more than 100 000 chemical products on the European market , a large majority of which have never been evaluated with regard to their long-term effects . #% Had this section been removed we could have supported the final report . #% Let us assume our responsibilities as a House in the area where we have the complete authority to do so and let us vote in the order indicated . #% I would urge the Commission to monitor progress and to formulate a cohesive policy involving all actors in the process of production and supply of biomass and biofuels . #% The real threat to implementation comes from the Member States themselves . #% I look forward to working with my colleagues to do what I can for the people of Haiti . #% 
As we help them , we must record their stories , to begin the process of gathering evidence for targeted attacks and possible war crimes . #% This experience has shown that the environmental damage from such a disaster knows no boundaries and respects no frontiers . #% The Member States must primarily have the role to respond to Member States ' needs , but collectively the European Union , as a region , is very weak in dealing with this problem . #% The proposal is also relevant for the assessment of national allocation plans under the proposed emissions trading directive , which is going through at the moment . #% Given the establishment of the internal market and the imminent introduction of the single currency , consumer policy must be implemented on a pan-European basis rather than by Member States acting alone . #% A lot of work needs to be done there . #% In my own country , Ireland , and in the neighbouring United Kingdom , the predominant language is an ever more global English . #% The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty . #% Residue testing , pre mortem , through urine and blood samples , and post mortem , through kidney and meat sampling , must be carried out by the competent veterinary authorities to ensure maximum food safety . #% From an environmental point of view it is more important to optimise collection and recycling in the Community as a whole , rather than to consider whether this takes place in a particular Member State . #% It was a totally horrendous programme , although I agree social exclusion is a major factor in these dreadful occurrences . #% That the euro may suffer from a popularity deficit in some countries in the eurozone should come as no surprise . #% We witnessed it again at last week 's conference of the National People 's Congress in Beijing . #% One of the consequences of this judgment is that there will now be an obligation on all Member States to ensure that there is a common system available to give assistance to those students who are in Erasmus programmes or who are studying in full-time programmes in countries other than their own Member States . #% First of all , tourism is an indigenous industry -- it does not rely on inward investment -- and it is not a mobile industry in the sense that there is no off-shoring or outsourcing of jobs . #% In simple terms , if you want to put a whaleback on a vessel to protect the crew and create a safer environment , you are now penalised . #% I conclude my presentation by underlining that it is our fishermen and women who will have a central role in deciding the future of the European fishing industry . #% Mr President , the fact that over 10 000 petitions have been received by the Committee on Petitions since its inception clearly demonstrates the practical significance of the European Union for its citizens . #% Is that promoting foreign relations ? #% The national alcohol policy will discourage under-age and excessive drinking through promotion of alcoholism-awareness and encouragement of participation in alternative activities . #% Firstly , we are in favour of protection of the people of the European Union . #% It is important that we explain to business what its obligations are and what it has to do to achieve your consumer protection objectives . #% Now that the Charter of Fundamental rights has the same legal value as the treaties , I am confident that the charter , and especially , the right to good administration , will be at the heart of Mr Diamandouros ' work as Ombudsman . #% With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested , it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise . #% We should not mix up development aid with an economic policy that the Community is pursuing in relation to fishing . #% Hence this debate . #% Mr President , we have to address this question of the ageing of our population from the point of view of having a society for all ages , as our motion indicates . #% I say to him - because he does not have a great understanding of history - that historically , a ` Tory ' means somebody who is hunted : ` tóraidhe ' , a hunted one . #% I thank the rapporteur and the committee for supporting those amendments . #% They are in fact complementary to one another and should form the basis of our strategy in this particular area . #% This will provide them with remuneration for their work and valuable work experience , which I hope will assist them in their future careers . #% In relation to the suggestion that a higher degree of the allocations should go to Member States whose market is most damaged , I would point out that for a country like Ireland , for example , which is a much smaller country than the United Kingdom , where we have something like a little more than half of the total number of cattle that they have in the United Kingdom , the knock-on effect has been significantly greater , because in our case we export 85 % of our product . #% in writing . - MEP Záborská has presented a report which presents a definition of the term ` work ' which includes non-monetary and informal labour , which extends recognition to non-market-based or non-remunerated work . #% But , if we go down the route of identifying and tagging each individual sheep , apart altogether from a flock identification tag , and then removing it when the lamb goes to the fattener , we could be left with sheep with three or four tags , or you would be removing tags and adding others : something we are trying unsuccessfully to sort out in Ireland at the moment . #% Who shall speak for you ? #% I would ask the President if he could instruct the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control to look into this issue , because it should be dealt with very quickly . #% I hope that the slogan of the Dutch presidency will become ` opt in or opt out ' . #% I think both of them not only take credit for themselves but indeed bring credit to this Parliament for the way in which they have carried out that duty . #% It is a unique problem which requires a unique response . #% It is horrific that slavery and exploitation can take place on the European continent where we like to think of ourselves as socially enlightened . #% in writing . - The general thrust of this report advocates that rather than import protein from third countries , we should encourage farmers to produce it here in Europe . #% in writing . - I voted no to this report and in doing so , was mindful of a good news story in respect of our marine environment . #% We have had a tribunal , known as the Lindsey tribunal , which was wound up recently , having sat for some time trying to resolve the very tragic cases of patients , many of whom have since died , who received infected blood . #% The Intergovernmental Conference must prepare for the expansion of the European Union to include the former communist countries in Eastern Europe . #% I would like to thank you particularly Mr Ahern , President-in-Office of the Council , for joining with Austria and proposing a new convention on Euratom to review this treaty . #% When the time came , would these same people support those amendments in another situation ? #% We had a very good ferry service set up between Ballycastle and the south of Scotland which was forced to close recently because of lack of support and bureaucracy . #% I am satisfied that the compromise adopted by the Council involves an important role for the national regulatory authorities . #% I welcome the fact that the European Council , with the encouragement of the European Commission , adopted the date of the next European election as a target timetable , all the while emphasising and respecting the fact that we should continue with a case by case analysis based on differentiation . #% We need to end the ludicrous discriminatory practices that are stopping our businesses from getting a foothold in the European market . #% There is a significant step which the Commission could take with regard to this and that would be to abandon its ridiculous age-discrimination policies . #% I hope that you will use your voice to teach the lessons to be learned from the former Yugoslavia . #% GATT and the WTO have done little or nothing so far to make increased trade a reality for these very poor economies . #% I am asking the Commission to come forward now with a draft directive . #% Putting child-labour concerns at the core of all our trade agreements has to given priority . #% This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components . #% We must tackle our dependence on oil , diversify our energy sources , promote energy conservation measures , develop renewable energy sources . #% As far as I am concerned , the Member is pushing an open door . #% Indeed , the international community should show commitment exceeding that shown to tackle the financial crisis . #% For example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success . #% Again , this is a serious matter for consideration by the governments of the Member States , and finance for these measures would be a good investment on the part of the EU . #% Madam President , this was an extremely important report . #% This is only partly related to price . #% Mr President , I want first of all to welcome Giorgos Katiforis ' s report . #% Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations . #% Each of us has a right , and indeed a responsibility , to ensure that we can maintain the best possible balance for all within the fundamental principles of consumer rights and protection as well as remuneration for the artists . #% 
In recent days , the Commission has approved excise relief for a bio-ethanol pilot project in Ireland using rapeseed oil and I particularly welcome that . #% And how can you continue relations with the government of Colombia where , quite clearly , government-controlled agencies , especially the army , are ongoingly guilty of the most heinous crimes , as only recently shown in the horrific discovery of the mass grave of innocent murder victims in La Macarena . #% But we are in a dilemma here . #% We should recall that it was the European Union that took the initiative recently to ban the use of particular chemicals in the manufacture of plastic tiles . #% On East Timor - and I note , Mr Prodi , what you said this morning - where are we ? #% However , there are a few things that I want to point out . #% I believe that such an approach will encourage voluntary participation by women in the labour market and will hopefully close the gender gap as well . #% The reason I am raising the matter here , by way of question , is because the content of my question was not dealt with in your statement yesterday . #% There is sufficient evidence to warrant a whole re-think on the health implications of these masts . #% In Ireland , as in all Member States , we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels . #% We must harness the field of science to deliver rapid and affordable solutions today . #% I commend the report to the House . #% One vote at a time . #% As far as the environment is concerned , we are a long way off meeting the targets which we set ourselves in Rio . #% In February this year a number of trade unionists -- members of a peasant farmers ' association -- were arrested . #% This legislation is a gross affront to justice and the human rights of victims ; it is a stomach-churning illustration of how low governments can stoop when they set about appeasing terrorism . #% I believe the resulting text is not only technically workable , but is a good balance between investor protection and easing the access to capital markets for enterprises in Europe . #% in writing . - The Ombudsman offers an important service to Irish citizens . #% I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union . #% Mr President , I believe that this directive represents a terrible infringement of our right to these products . #% The budget for next year is going to have to take account of these commitments . #% That is completely unfair . #% As the scientific evidence is still inconclusive , we can not allow parents to be misled . #% We have to bear in mind all the time that resources are finite and that we must improve life for everyone in the Community . #% We are very concerned about the reports we have received in relation to imprisonment of religious leaders of the United Buddhist Church , despite constitutional guarantees of religious freedom . #% The Treaty of Nice does not build a two-tier European Union whereby larger Member States can dictate the pace of change within the Union at the expense of the smaller states . #% It is highly efficient , a daily service to all sectors of the community in all parts of the country at a reasonable price . #% I say to Mr Bush : pull my other leg ! #% author . - Madam President , first of all , I welcome the fact that this issue is being discussed here today . #% Our presence here , as well as yours , Mr President , in the chair of this august assembly , sends a huge signal to all small Member States that the systems and the processes in Europe allow the smallest of nations to come to the top in the right circumstances . #% Events of recent days clearly bring this possibility into focus and must surely alert Parliament to the need for quick and positive action . #% This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective . #% And , finally , what is the Commission 's up-to-date view with regard to continuing GSP + with Sri Lanka , considering that , after the election , the policies of Mr Rajapaksa 's government continue to be against human rights and workers ' rights in that country ? #% Since this is the first time , it is very important that we get it right . #% My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended . #% The bottom line is this : if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe , we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems . #% Critical new clauses , which we have insisted on and which were met with resistance in the Council , are the provisions combating asset stripping . #% However , that does not stop us joining up the dots in the relevant areas of European law that exist at the moment . #% Can he not answer the question of the honourable Member and state that the Council does abhor violence under all circumstances , that the Council does want to see the IRA cease-fire restored , can encourage the IRA cease-fire to be restored and indeed congratulate the Loyalist cease-fire for holding in these very trying circumstances ? #% I am glad that Commissioner Prodi is going to look at the EIB because , frankly , that institution is inefficient and ineffective in aiding those firms which could be innovative and competitive if they just had that helping hand . #% I ask myself : is this really a Council position or is it the position of one or two Member States ? 80 % of Member States have design protection already in national law . #% I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues , such as the possible existence of ` black sites ' in EU Member States . #% It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself . #% I am therefore glad that the accession states are being spared this lunacy . #% Our colleague over in the far corner of the House spoke earlier and quoted the Bible . #% More and more scientific research shows that modern-day illnesses such as asthma , allergies , certain types of cancer and work-related illnesses are often the result of chemical products in the environment . #% It is estimated that an EU/Mercosur deal could reduce Irish beef prices by 30 % which would inflict losses of up to EUR 500 million in Ireland alone . #% First of all , in relation to the reconstruction works , let me say that I recently conducted the launch for the World Bank of a document explaining , in a very well-designed handbook , exactly how reconstruction should take place . #% As a democracy , where the people are sovereign , the Irish people is also entitled to decide to reconsider its decision and to confirm or reverse it . #% . Mr President , I agree with the Commissioner 's statement . #% When Mr Deva asked Commissioner Nielson a question on Mozambique and about the delay in getting helicopters there , it was dismissed out of hand by Commissioner Nielson . #% You have played your role and you can take credit for that . #% However , farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified . #% It is important that we continue to maintain a high level of dialogue at summit and ministerial level to address critical issues facing the European Community . #% Mr President , there are many examples of this Parliament and the institutions responding with urgency to matters of public concern and none more so than in the area of food safety and consumer protection . #% We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community , especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country , for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government . #% If we support network access for renewables in Europe , we should not find ourselves in this position . #% Let me make an altogether separate point of order . #% Similarly when prices on the world markets are higher than they are in the European Union , as has happened thankfully recently , we save ourselves that cost and the money is retained in the budget and we can use it for something else . #% The last thing we want is to have our waters opened up to more effort by Spanish fishermen , or indeed any other fishermen . #% in writing . - I voted to restrict the EP budget for 2012 , given the economic , financial and social constraints on EU Member States . #% Can the Council confirm that notification has been given to states en route ? #% We were way behind when this started and over the last five years have almost caught up . #% There are common policies to encourage our development . #% My country , which is a small island , can not solve or undertake to tackle climate change alone , just like any other country . #% I welcome the directive on cross-border credit transfers which is now in force within the Union . #% 
I am sure that the Commission is perfectly aware of these other approaches but they are convinced that the Council and the fishing industry do not have the interest or the courage to explore other ideas . #% In relation to Vietnam , we call on the authorities to promote and to allow a multi-party system to reflect different viewpoints , to end all repression of religious minority groups such as the unified Buddhist church and to release Vietnamese political prisoners of conscience . #% But the emphasis , from Parliament 's point of view , should be on having the letter of the law complied with in so far as the making of these agreements is concerned . #% However , the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives . #% This referendum undoubtedly underlines the need for greater efforts to be made by all of us to explain European Union policies to our citizens and to involve the citizens of the EU more thoroughly in the debate about the Union 's role and its future direction . #% Mr President , as the person chairing the Committee of Inquiry , I can reassure Mr Mote that those witnesses who did not answer be back -- we have a guarantee ! #% Nevertheless , the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme will be of very real value and I look forward to its adoption following the Commissioner 's declaration , and to a vote tomorrow which I hope will be very well supported by a European Parliament that will follow the programme with great interest . #% You can put in controls that will be so bureaucratic that they just will not work , so we have to concentrate on what is workable . #% Firstly , with regard to the Euratom framework programme , the promotion of nuclear energy has always characterized this programme and we are long overdue a change of vision , especially with regard to fusion . #% We have an opportunity after the recent events to rebuild and improve the transatlantic relationship - that has to be the challenge we take on board . #% I am more interested in the originality or old age of the ideas of these three individuals rather than their chronological age . #% We need to start work on the longer term position of agriculture , vis-à-vis the present CAP reform end in 1999 and also the next WTO round . #% in writing . - The trafficking of human beings is deplorable anywhere in the world , but particularly disgraceful in the European Union given our high levels of internal cooperation and resources . #% Is it not shameful that large Member States like my own and Germany can not supply the number of people skilled in information technology ? #% There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission . #% Livestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Community . #% Mr President , this is a subject we could fruitfully discuss for a long time yet . #% In the words of the then Irish Presidency , over-fishing is part of the overall problem ; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term . #% I suggest a level of 50 % of women . #% He talks about cooperation and the WEU , but we want that cooperation to extend to the neutral and non-nuclear states of this Union . #% This vote refers to certain Council Acts in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy . #% The recent nuclear accident in Japan , which we were told could never happen , demonstrates yet again that current nuclear energy production is potentially catastrophic . #% We can not support this any longer . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate today on public services . #% Nobody wants to upset the Union at this moment or withdraw Northern Ireland from it without the consent of both traditions . #% The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad . #% I remain convinced that refunds constitute a fundamental element of the policy ; they play an important role in the management of agricultural markets and must be defended at WTO level . #% It is unfortunate that the EPO has granted it a patent : this is an example of bad EPO practice . #% Madam President , I listened with great interest to what Mr Santer and Mr Dini said to us here this morning . #% The figure is now 5.35 % . #% Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold , traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers . #% This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session . #% Some other children disappear because they have had fatal accidents and they are never found either . #% We know that there are ground-to-air missiles at Cap de la Hague , and the defences of Sellafield remain a secret . #% I welcome Mr Oostlander 's report and hope that this House will take seriously the need to be ruthless in tracking down the members of these drug cartels . #% The future enlargement of the European Union to incorporate the ten central and eastern European countries is the most dramatic development ever to be contemplated or undertaken by the Union . #% Why should such a product be taken out of the seas and then given away ? #% Without prejudice to the arrangements in existing Member States , it is a question that we must look at in due course . #% We have good people and bad people . #% This is enshrined in all our constitutions as well as the constitutions of those accession countries joining the European Union in enlargement . #% Politicians do not see any shame in this . #% It is also about lack of recognition and about hindrances at national level whereby the internal market is not completed . #% That is completely unacceptable to the democratic process and our government is guilty of treachery in its approach to the Irish vote . #% It amounts to a form of intergovernmental conspiracy against citizens ' right to know . #% Can I just simply ask the Commission : firstly , how would it comment on the provision of the dispute settlement mechanism and how will this operate in practice ? #% Clarity on the coordination of the European Commission 's policy on State aid and social policy is urgently needed . #% Why was the UN Council taken by surprise ? #% All in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process . #% Matters falling outside the remit of directives , such as indirect advertising or billboards and cinema advertising , remain within the competence of the individual Member States . #% So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully . #% We need to know what are the revenue implications for states . #% The honourable Member has raised a very important point . #% We must learn from our hearings . #% We need to create dynamic cities that respect people and the environment and involve community groups in the planning and process and in regeneration processes as such . #% However , it is my strong belief that it is more important to assess the impact of enlargement on existing European policies and , if necessary , to reform the actual policies rather than concentrate on administrative and institutional reform . #% If we try it again we create an illusion and that illusion will lead to a weak , inflation-prone , high interest rate Euro-zone . #% Finally , since we would like to have a sort of regionalisation , a 30-mile limit would be immensely helpful to employ the goodwill of fishermen in the business of reorganising . #% I think it is very timely , and the recent crisis in the dairy sector , which crippled so many of our farmers across the European Union , certainly demonstrated the serious volatility which can affect our agriculture markets . #% You are denying the reality of the situation if you say that force-feeding does not cause unnecessary suffering or injury . #% It was a particularly bad season for the Commission and a particularly difficult time to proceed through all the normal channels since we had elections , Commission difficulties , and so on . #% A study that was carried out in Ireland just recently and published yesterday by SIPTU , a trade union organization , and by IBEC , representing business interests , shows quite clearly that between # 15 and # 17 will be added on to the cost of an airline ticket for the average traveller . #% EU agricultural export subsidies gravely undermine food security elsewhere , and we have yet to assess the ecological and social impact of our fisheries agreements with developing countries . #% Finally , when we receive the Commission 's updated report , I hope we will be able to quickly resolve any outstanding problems , so that the Maltese people can themselves decide once and for all on their future place in the European Union . #% Mr President , I too am amazed that Commissioner Monti , having had time to reflect on the discussions we had earlier this week at Question Time and having heard the strong feelings that the majority of the House - we , the messengers of the people - have on this issue , is not prepared to relent , even at this very late stage , and give us a more positive response . #% In addition to my work in the committee I have also participated , on behalf of Parliament , in a great many international conferences . #% Protection of juveniles is equally important and must be one of our priorities . #% 
We should not allow a system to develop whereby the European Union is given a free hand to impose criminal sanctions in Europe . #% Even after the British rebate is taken into account the EU is scheduled to cost the UK # 4 298 million in 2006 . #% We can not afford to live in a time warp . #% Five of the nine people for whose disappearance the IRA claims responsibility remain unaccounted for . #% Before they ever reach this stage , our Department of Agriculture is seeing fit to exclude them from certain premium payments by making an assessment against them for this off-farm income . #% Much has been made of women 's rights in Afghanistan , but as I said , nothing has changed . #% Ireland represents 1 % of the European Union , 1 % of the economy . #% We are all in this together . #% In many countries and areas - such as where I come from in Northern Ireland - young children might not have had the opportunity to have that nourishment and that nutritional support supplied by milk if it had not been for the milk provided to them in schools . #% We clearly need a far more flexible legal framework to keep abreast of technological advances in banking systems . #% FMD-vaccinated animals are not infectious when they get into the food chain . #% In the last few years happily , there has been an increase in marriages between citizens from different countries , but this brings with it also its own problems . #% Since we know that the debate on such vast and sensitive issues will be difficult and the time is now running out , I want to inform the Council and the Commission that the Committee on Development is setting up a working group to discuss the policy content . #% In many respects they have been made the scapegoats in the present controversy and are certainly paying a high price for a crisis that was not of their direct making . #% The European Union is right to support a negotiated settlement in the Middle East which reflects the principles of the transfer of land for peace , which ensures the collective and individual security of both Israeli and Palestinian peoples . #% The way to move forward is through cooperation and dialogue , and permanent peace must be established . #% As regards the antibiotic issue where nisin is going to be allowed into egg products , this is completely unacceptable . #% We know that new forms of business , particularly in the field of e-commerce , are developing . #% That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future . #% The Council 's decision in this matter must be overturned . #% I would also like to remind the House that 28 states -- not 25 -- participated in the Convention and that at least Turkey , Bulgaria and Romania should be included in any debate now about the future of Europe . #% As far as Mr Schwaiger is concerned , he is absolutely right to say that we must have , before long , some sort of aquis communautaire in the sector of nuclear safety . #% If we have to have some difficult debates , for God 's sake , let us have them in September and let us have it out in September so that we do not have some form of institutional guerilla warfare right through to December or January . #% I accept that Ecofin endorsed the judgment of the Commission . #% In conclusion , I welcome the statements made by the Commission and Mr Cushnahan , but regretfully the statement made by the Council does this House an injustice because it is an insult to our intelligence and for what we stand . #% I look forward to hearing the Commissioner 's declaration , which is a declaration that I made clear was essential if we were to find agreement . #% in writing . - On a practical level I welcome the proposed developments for the long-term protection of marine resources , for both environmental and economic purposes ; the updating of fishing technologies , and the emphasis it places on the need for professional qualifications within the sector . #% However , a considerable amount is not being distributed , mainly because of the mismatch between the needs of SMEs - refinancing of some sort - and the European Investment Bank objective , which is money for medium-term investment . #% We must all remember that Yasser Arafat is the democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people and he has the political authority and the political mandate to represent the concerns and the needs of the Palestinian people at this time . #% Regrettably , the solo run by British Prime Minister Tony Blair has seriously undermined the EU 's influence and our foreign policy strategy . #% It will fall to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find the solution . #% What are we going to do in relation to deregulation to allow businesses to flourish , to allow innovation ? #% We also recorded in the Minutes a declaration that our acceptance of the Commission 's proposal is on the basis that , at most , minimal tariff reductions will be applied to sensitive sectors , especially beef and butter . #% We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels . #% Women are universally under-represented where decisions are made . #% Many people with disabilities face discrimination , maltreatment and institutional confinement . #% At the same time , we continue to adopt a cavalier approach towards the biodiversity of less developed countries through this trade , even though there is a ban for the moment . #% Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU , although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated , which is done only in the United States . #% As previous speakers have already said , it is being considered at an opportune time . #% I congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Berend once again on a job well done . #% We are all aware in this Chamber that the people of Ireland rejected the provisions of the Nice Treaty last year by a small margin . #% The fact that they are abandoning the sales ban is an absolute disgrace , apart from the fact that it was supposed to come into effect in 1998 . #% Mr President , this afternoon a very important event took place in Constanza County in Romania : the official opening of protected homes for over 100 people who currently live in unsatisfactory conditions . #% We are not yet as transparent as we could be or ought to be on our individual group and collective expenditures financed by public purse . #% Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations . #% Simply setting minimum prices for imports or financial compensation schemes are not sufficient : further action is required . #% Mr President , let me say at the outset that , as a member of the European Parliament 's High Level Contact Group for relations with Northern Cyprus , I am clearly aware of the sense of isolation the Turkish Cypriots feel in light of the rejection of the Annan Plan . #% We also have a limited capacity to use recycled packaging . #% The Convention has carried out a great deal of work since it was first established 18 months ago , and we now await the results . #% We would recommend that the final version of the compliance protocol establish a modern and open verification regime capable of adjusting to changes in political climate and in technological capabilities . #% Furthermore , would she consider postponing decisions until people have had an opportunity to find their feet under the new system ? #% While it is important for us to be prepared and vigilant and to take precautionary action , with responsible risk assessment and forward planning , a lot will depend on the availability and effectiveness of anti-virals and vaccines and hospital bed capacity , which has been seriously reduced in all EU countries in the last decade . #% The most important issue moving forward is to examine the effectiveness of the technical design elements for the policy to deliver its full potential for environmental and economic efficiency , while also giving special attention to the situation of Ireland and other isolated territories , which are so particularly dependent on air transport services , both capital and regional areas . #% Many colleagues come from Member States which were this summer struck by floods and landslides . #% I wish you well in your work . #% I am extremely pleased to see the President of the Commission here and I hope that Mr Prodi , as President of the Commission , will assert his presidential leadership on a regular basis in that way on strategic issues such as enlargement . #% This objective will only be achieved if it can be clearly demonstrated to the majority of people that the European Union is relevant to their day-to-day concerns and that the Union can contribute to finding solutions to the problems in our society . #% In addition we are all conscious of the anxieties in the minds of so many Germans , who twice in living memory have seen their life savings destroyed by hyperinflation , that this should never happen again . #% I think it shows the ability of the European Union and its institutions to come together in matters of common interest - it shows that we can compromise and have debate . #% Our input into organisations such as the World Trade Organisation would be very much strengthened by the enlargement of the European Union . #% It is important that we have this period of deep reflection . #% A sustained campaign by lobbyists financially supported by Smith-KlineBeecham misrepresented and misinformed MEPs about the patients ' organizations . #% Everyone here will be familiar with the history of this particular application . #% But the fact of the matter is that in addition to the dangers for small publishers , we are facing the onslaught of a massive , blockbuster culture where huge amounts of money are made on sometimes quite appallingly bad books . #% The audiovisual industry is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in Europe . #% A lack of enforcement systems for payment undermines the internal market and business confidence . #% 
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his resolve . #% You have been an outstanding representative of this House who has earned the thanks and support of everyone here . #% As we become consumers we increasingly ask , can we afford a child ? #% Legally , our arguments are sound . #% We are dealing with taxpayers ' money ; they have entrusted their money to us and they rightly expect to see positive results within the context of overall value for money . #% It is by embracing our cultural and linguistic diversity that we enhance the understanding of Europe , its diverse peoples and its many different regions . #% We have the instruments available . #% The fact remains that the food industry in the EU is protein deficient . #% The objective of the SMA , was supposed to give implementation to the Monti report which had as main concern to re-launch the Single Market . #% Whilst I voted in favour of the report and the decision to refuse to grant a budget discharge for 2008 , this is the first time that a discharge has been used against an individual organisation . #% Finally , I have not so far mentioned football , but I have to mention one aspect and that is that football is a game of two halves and even extra time . #% It is the duty of the Committee on Budgetary Control to identify failure in administration and propose solutions . #% I commend the Commission for taking this initiative under Article 152 . #% If we have seen anything over the last few months , it is the inability of the European Union to speak with a single voice ; it is the failure by certain Member State governments within the European Union to agree with the majority of other Member States that has allowed this problem to continue and to get worse . #% Mr President , I too join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Vice-President . #% It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure , but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out . #% Secondly , that the small and medium-sized enterprise sector , which has been spoken about by other colleagues , be given freedom to operate and create new jobs and new economic growth within the whole European Union . #% Mr President , my group supports the Commission 's proposals . #% But , I believe and many people within the neutral countries believe that when further decisions are taken , eventually the mutual defence commitment will be applied . #% These totally unacceptable conditions not only undermine the health of our junior doctors , they also undermine our health care system and endanger the patient . #% Having researched this enormously over the last seven years prior to submitting Cork 's nomination , one of the key issues we saw as being important in designating a city as a capital of culture was that it allowed for greater understanding of the diversity of the cultures and traditions which exist within the European Union . #% in writing . - Firstly , let me say that I welcome the moves of my colleagues , especially Senor de Castro , who has taken the initiative to start the debate on this issue . #% in writing . - The cultural dimensions of EU external actions should not be overstated , and it is important that Commissioner Ashton continues to build this into her work with the EEAS . #% in writing . - As part of the European Economic Recovery Plan , an extra $ 1 billion has been earmarked for the development of broadband internet infrastructure in rural areas via the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development . #% The 2001 report is an interesting one . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur for her good work ; she certainly made my life easier . #% If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal . #% We in this Parliament are the tribune of the peoples of the European Union and we have gathered here today to declare solemnly our outrage , our sympathy , our solidarity and our common bond in humanity and democracy with the people of the United States of America , and with the people of New York City and Washington D.C. . #% I am not sure about the implications of Amendment No 9 , which covers the Commission 's proposals on the transmission of information received by the Commission to the competent authorities of the Member States . #% The politics of the Western Sahara issue is complex and I want to focus my remarks primarily on human rights , although , obviously , there is a crossover between the two . #% We are talking about priorities for our cooperation with Latin America , the Middle East , Central Asia , the Far East and South Africa ; our priorities in the fields of human and social development ; sustainable management of natural resources such as water and energy ; the environment and the role of non-State actors . #% in writing . - I fully support MEP Angelilli 's own-initiative report and the recommendation to the Council on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography . #% With few exceptions , European society today is very tolerant . #% Coming from Ireland , which tries to sell itself as the ` Food Island ' , I believe the marketing and job-creation potential of organic products is enormous . #% Madam President , I want to put a question on the issue of our order of business , so I am not expressing a view for or against . #% There is no alternative type of tobacco which is not dangerous to health and it is ridiculous to promote the idea that there is . #% Fundamentally , I feel there is a serious conflict in the description of European citizen which is in the Maastricht Treaty if somehow we are strangers to each other and must show passports while we travel within the Union . #% I hope that all of us have learned this lesson from the events of the last year . #% The fact that we have failed , and the Council has failed , to harmonise taxation , creates a situation in which motor vehicles cost a lot more in the first place , and this has some knock-on effect in the insurance sector , but it is not sufficient to explain it . #% The risk of a further ` Credit Crunch ' is not over . #% In particular , it is necessary to broaden the partnership to include those sectors that are at present excluded , in particular the SME sector . #% We will shortly give him a tool to encourage him to carry out work on that basis . #% It is important for us to accept that there are moments of crisis , sorrow and strain in all of our lives and that when we experience them we may need support and we may need understanding , but we do not always need a diagnosis and a drug . #% I was not breaking the peace , but trying to keep the peace by helping to rid the world of nuclear weapons . #% Whilst this is a welcome change in the way in which the Commission looks at fisheries agreements , it should take the same approach with the ACP agreements . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Commissioner , many of my constituents are babies and very young children , and tonight I would like to speak on their behalf , especially as there are many very good speakers tonight who can speak effectively for women in the workplace . #% We could say that Ireland is a country under construction . #% In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by the use of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy , by the use the power or strength of energy to try and make people kneel before the influence of the Russian Government , and , most importantly of all , by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes . #% For its part , the European Parliament will no longer be prepared to be presumed to be the junior partner in European decision-making . #% But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee . #% This is a resolution driven by those consumed by a fanatical desire to usurp national authority and status . #% Finally , I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information . #% The savage experience of British citizens abroad confirms my view that we have much to lose from criminal justice integration . #% A personal and vitriolic attack like that is unjustified when the person is not present . #% International global security is best dealt with multilaterally under the auspices of the UN , not unilaterally , and I welcome the objective for Prime Minister Simitis to secure a common European Union position on Iraq when the UN inspectors ' report is published . #% Our laws now must reflect this change in consumer behaviour . #% Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote . #% So certainly let us address the problem of structural deficiencies but let us also recognize that there is a lack of principle involved in some of the ways we shape our policy . #% I thank Mr Papoutsis for his continuing work in this area . #% These farms should be given a limited period to change this practice and find alternative methods . #% It is not Boston versus Berlin , it is ensuring that we do what is right for all the people in Europe in the 21st century . #% Well , the record of the Irish presidency during the last six months and in particular during the Dublin Summit , like the previous Irish presidency , demonstrates clearly that smaller Member States can organize efficient and successful presidencies and in many cases can broker agreements which larger Member States are unable to achieve during their presidencies . #% It is important , of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions . #% This Commissioner 's role would be to promote the dialogue about that philosophy and to help create a world in which there is no longer any war or any conflict . #% A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate . #% What struck me was that they all speak a common language , which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe . #% 
Mr President , I apologise for being late . #% Within the European Union we have 60 , 000 farmers depending on sheepmeat and milk . #% One of the core elements of the Committee on Foreign Affairs ' opinion is that the Council and the Commission should regularly raise the issue of human trafficking in political dialogues with third countries . #% Mr President , I just wish to state that I was here yesterday but did not vote . #% I note in recital E of this resolution that we Europeans give ourselves a nice pat on the back for our humanitarian aid efforts . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Emilia Franziska Müller for her patience with me for making her job a lot more difficult than it might otherwise have been . #% Sometimes in Parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing . #% Blocking off the supply of funds to terrorist organisations and their associates is one of the most important means at our disposal in dealing with the Al-Qaida networks . #% Mr President , when I spoke earlier I said I should like to reserve the right to speak again . #% As rightly as we condemn all forms of violence , as rightly as we condemn the episodes that have taken place in Jenin , in the Church of the Nativity around Bethlehem , and the suicide bombers in the cafes and restaurants in Israel , we must also be willing and aware in order to assist in bringing the people together . #% I was quite impressed by the Commissioner 's speech in which he identified the need for reform of our international law in relation to how , when and who should intervene in other states . #% Even the fishing industry itself says that there is overcapacity and that reductions are necessary . #% The European Union also has competence in environmental matters under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty . #% We are currently facing a refugee crisis in the area and many regimes are turning on their own people . #% I do not think the Commission is actually addressing the issue . #% The Irish presidency must guard against short-term solutions to the problem of funding the trans-European networks which involve diverting money from either the CAP or the structural funds , both of which must be maintained at their present level . #% I call on all Member States to sign , ratify or accede to the protocol as soon as possible . #% The Dutch have a bigger surplus still , something like 35 billion . #% I congratulate Prime Minister Vanhanen . #% I welcome the Commission 's proposal to encourage public procurement of clean and efficient vehicles , including using high biofuel blends . #% Mr President , Africa has featured a lot today in the debate , and rightly so . #% The fact of matter is this : we live in an internal market where there is free movement of goods , services , persons and capital . #% The observatory in Lisbon can not work effectively without very close relationships with the Europol agency in The Hague . #% The initiatives mentioned in Mr Varela 's report are very good ones , but the report does not get rid of the remaining problems , especially the overfishing of several species such as bigeye and bluefin tuna , as well as the unacceptable amount of by-catch involving a wide number of species taken via so-called FAD fishing -- the favoured method used by EU vessels . #% Politicians can be broadly divided into pragmatists and idealists . #% That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do . #% I thank you sincerely for your understanding of the Irish position on this issue . #% It is regrettable that , for party political reasons , some Members are not willing to recognise what everybody else sees , not just in this House but outside it . #% I readily admit that there is always room for improvement . #% There have been other very welcome moves because there were restrictions on trade union pluralism , a total ban on freedom of association and collective bargaining for government employees and teachers and the illegality of one of the two major Korean union confederations - the KCTU . #% In Ireland , spouses of self-employed people or farmers are often not covered by social insurance in their own right , even though they work on the farm or in the business . #% I would also ask this House to criticize the acknowledged five nuclear powers for setting a bad example and in particular for the nuclear test in Mururoa some time ago . #% National allocations will have to be linearly convergent with the Kyoto Protocol . #% We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos , a real public space for the citizens of Europe . #% Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe . #% Whatever measures we take to ensure the free movement of goods must not undermine the right to industrial action or peaceful protest by the EU workforce . #% I wish it every success in doing so . #% History has shown that large-scale commercial hunting and sale of wild animals frequently pushes species to the brink of extinction . #% To date , there are three versions of the ` truth ' . #% I would remind the House that all food contains hormones . #% People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco . #% The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration . #% Now some amendments to the Fiori report go further than the Caudron report . #% I do not begrudge the fishermen of Spain and France the subsidies we are giving them but I think we should give them in a different way . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on the tremendous work he has done . #% However , we must pay due regard to long-established practices in an industry that has been largely self-regulating in many countries . #% We give tax incentives for machines and we put payroll taxes on employment . #% The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this . #% I was opposed to it . #% For instance , EU cephalopod vessels are allowed to keep over four times as much fish by-catch as Guinean vessels . #% I have also supported paragraph 10 , simply because if one wants to reduce the number of abortions , one should recognise the right of individuals to avail of counselling about sex education , including counselling about responsibilities in relationships and information about contraception . #% I think it is timely and I return to my point - I still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the Member States and that we in Europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected . #% I congratulate the Commission on taking legal action against the Atlantic Dawn , but I would now like to hear from the Commission the latest on this case . #% This is an extremely important report because the European Union has to look at its own faults and problems before it can actually point the finger at other parts of the world . #% Traditionally , of course , in the EU , it was women 's work , although that is changing . #% Finally , decisions must be made on scientific findings and I draw the attention of the House to the findings of the recent report prepared by Dr Bernadette Earley , which presented a very coherent , balanced and objective view of live animal transport to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% Can you assure us that the Council will play its full part , in the same way that the Commission and Parliament have , in mobilizing the political resources of the European Union in bringing about a peaceful resolution to this conflict in Northern Ireland ? #% I would basically ask that OLAF , the EU anti-fraud agency , needs to be given increased resources . #% I think that with enlargement we have an opportunity to look again at the whole question of minority languages . #% This directive which streamlines the issue of civil liability in respect of accidents involving motor vehicles is a logical extension to directives which have been put in place over the last 13 years to complete the European Single Market . #% Commissioner , thank you for your response . #% We are still seeing pictures and videos of what happened and it is still hard for us to comprehend the massive scale of destruction and the loss of human life . #% Farmers can not accept being treated in this way . #% This present Europe , as your presidency demonstrates , Mr Juncker , can not work . #% Mr Bowis led us in relation to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , and he leads us here in this report . #% I do not exclude Parliament from this , I am not a sore loser but I was part of the minority which lost in the postal services liberalisation proposal . #% 
Everybody should be entitled to equal rights . #% Monitoring is very important . #% Their ability to survive is constantly undermined . #% The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of e-business . #% That should be resisted . #% The foundation they receive is of utmost importance , but the time , space and nurturing children need to grow and develop fully is becoming a luxury afforded to fewer and fewer . #% Therefore I ask you , Commissioner Barnier and your colleagues , to look at the opportunities offered by other policies , in particular the real and tangible benefits of involving the private sector in regenerating our regions . #% There is a message for Stockholm that our commitment is real and deep and must be prioritised to deliver . #% I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world : much to our shame , we have taught them some tricks . #% However , I also expressed concerns with regard to some of the amendments adopted by the committee and to some of the stances taken within the committee . #% It is up to the Commission to come forward with a proposal that is water-tight and workable . #% The great firewall of China is perhaps the starkest example of such censorship . #% The TB test we use now is herd-specific , not animal-specific . #% Instead of penalising women for having children , the EU needs to support them and help them better balance work and family life . #% The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , therefore , takes note of the Commission 's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement , adopted on 7 December 2006 . #% The fact is that this is a world in which the response to natural disasters and to man-made problems clearly requires transnational governance . #% I hope , the next time this issue comes back to the UN , that Member States will put principle above trading interests . #% We currently have eight . #% I do not see the relevance of this idea of ex-territoriality . #% Furthermore the sector must deliver on best practice from a food safety perspective and here I disagree with my Irish colleague Mrs McKenna . #% We welcome the fact that this is occupying the attention of Helsinki . #% Finally I believe that this report had the broad support of the political groups within Parliament 's Committee on Transport . #% In Parliament it is disgraceful that the Petitions Committee , the single most important direct contact that the citizen has with this institution and with the other institutions of the European Union , is treated the way it is treated . #% What is important is that Member States be allowed to continue subsidising renewable energy sources which are not yet economically viable . #% These credits are regularly used to back projects and trade that are destructive to the environment and workers ' rights . #% The fact that between 1995 and 2002 farm incomes in the European Union rose by an average of 7 % highlights the very large disparities between countries , between crops and between producers . #% Minister Coughlan appears to want to divide the traditionally cohesive farming community by the exploitation of one group by another . #% The EU is 20 billion euro short of its funding commitments , at a time when states are cutting back their aid budgets . #% As there are no prescribed criteria in EU law governing the design or operation of nuclear facilities , how do we judge their safety of operation ? #% I have just been looking at the text of the joint motion for a resolution . #% It is about the specific social , economic and environmental problems of the entire small inshore fishing sector in all Member States of the European Union . #% Recent figures from the Irish Police Force say that 76 % of all crime in Ireland is drugsrelated . #% Undoubtedly there is a high level of expectation on the ground for clearer rules on the granting of aid to TEN-T projects . #% I need an adequate response from the Commission , and so far we have not had it . #% Compare this to the only super-state in the world today -- the United States -- the federal government of which spends 20 % of GDP , and you can see what a nonsense this accusation is . #% The media was likewise obliged to give as much coverage to the `` no '' campaign as to the `` yes '' campaign , without challenging the irrelevancies , despite the fact that all the major political parties , farm organisations , trade unions , press editorials and even the Conference of Bishops urged a `` yes '' vote . #% I would ask you , Madam President , to invite a Commissioner as urgently as possible here to tell us precisely what the European Union intends to do on the issue of Chechnya . #% It is cynical political manipulation to play games with disability rights . #% As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee , our preference was to vote `` yes '' to reform but `` no '' to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors . #% However , when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report , when we look at the disparate views - the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce - we sometimes forget that a lot of small - and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves , who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I , `` as an individual '' or anybody else , as an individual consumer , would have . #% I also wish to compliment Mr Trakatellis on his contribution in this report . #% The common fisheries policy seems always to be about control but the benefits never seem to come . #% The main subject of criticism is Islamic fundamentalism , and the report seems to concentrate too much on that . #% I believe it has a statement that it wishes to put on the record , to which I would like to be in a position to reply . #% He gave a lot up to the very last minute and I believe what America has done here is an example for Europe as well of what a major power , through its influence and good diplomacy , can achieve throughout the world . #% There is no comparison between the health and safety concerns as a result of exposure to sunlight , for instance , between a Nigerian worker on an Irish building site and an Irish worker on a Greek building site . #% I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium . #% I welcome the conclusions of this week 's Council meeting of EU Foreign Ministers ; they too stated that the will of the Irish people must be respected . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , on 8 January 2009 , the mid-west of Ireland , and especially Limerick , Tipperary and North Kerry , experienced an economic trauma they had never seen before . #% I have observed this before . #% Mr President , in noting the delay in the implementation of the packaging waste directive that the accession states are to be allowed , I wish to say that , from our experience in Northern Ireland , they are fortunate to escape its requirements for several years . #% in writing . - I supported the resolution on the new Commission recommendation to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations with the United States on the transfer of financial messaging data to combat terrorism . #% I agree with what Mrs Ludford said concerning the failure of the Irish presidency to be here today , which is an appalling message to send out to the European Community and indeed to the international community . #% One of the key elements arising from the debate is the recognition at last that , unless the economic wealth can be created , together with the employment terms to guarantee jobs and security within those jobs and rights after those jobs , then the European social model is non-existent . #% That nuclear installation on the west coast of Britain , far from the cosy seat of power in London , has been and remains a cause of serious concern to Irish citizens . #% We will look at a cost/benefit analysis of his amendments to that proposal . #% We are abdicating our duty as legislators to stand back and to pause and reflect . #% Can I assure the House , not simply on behalf of the presidency , but also as the Irish Member on the reflection group which went into a lot of these issues , that this matter is being examined in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and the presidency will do everything in its power to try to advance openness and transparency , while at the same time recognizing the right of Member States to have their business conducted in a way which is agreeable to everybody through a code of conduct . #% Because of the lack of proper control , mining companies have been able to get away with leaving behind , when they have finished their operations , a legacy which continues to pollute our environment and our water . #% There is nothing else in sight . #% In this context I would urge the governments of France , Italy , Spain and Portugal to consider carefully the implications of delaying an agreement . #% The day after its publication , it was reported that the UN Secretary-General would only launch an international investigation if the Sri Lankan Government agrees or an international forum such as the UN Foreign Security Council calls for an inquiry . #% The battle to reduce unemployment is and must remain our first priority . #% It is hard to believe ten years after the Chernobyl disaster which , as has already been said , left 125 , 000 dead and a further 3.5 million ill , that the plant in the Ukraine is still open even though it only produces about 6 % of the electricity there . #% Satellite systems are a very small but positive step , but a lot more needs to be done . #% Many of us in this Parliament deal on a regular basis with human rights in the world . #% 
Finally , it is a forward looking plan when we look at cooperation with the United States of America and other countries throughout the world , to ensure that this new technology can be used for the benefit of all of mankind and not for those who want to avoid our legal structures . #% During the course of the debate leading up to the referendum vote together with my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil political party , I will be campaigning enthusiastically for a strong ` yes ' vote . #% The Commission should ensure that the resources in future EU budgets are sufficient to provide for a continuation of existing EU programmes in an expanded Union of 25 . #% We want to see more effective use of funds and we do not want to see them duplicating what we do in mainstream funds or in the P & R programme but giving added value to work that is going on . #% The Palestinians see the EU as an honest and trustworthy broker . #% The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions . #% In aviation , I fully support the SKY initiative . #% Whatever savings in fuel were achieved , this reckless change in standards has now cost consumers , taxpayers and especially farmers several million times more than any possible savings . #% Biotechnological research must continue and must be properly funded . #% Cod amounts to about 10 % of the value of all fish annually landed in Northern Ireland . #% Can I first of all thank you very much for giving me the floor and can I pay tribute to the rapporteur and indeed to Mr Böge . #% Taking the long-term view in the context of Agenda 2000 , we must ensure that family farms and their individual enterprises are supported within the available budget resources . #% The proliferation of EU agencies in the field of health -- the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the European Food Safety Authority and others -- is a very welcome and necessary development in tackling these health threats . #% The European Union has been a bulwark against recession in the past . #% It has been a creation out of necessity -- the necessity that we now face before us . #% Further to what the Commissioner has said , is the Commission aware that several PVC toys have already been taken off the market in Spain , Sweden and Italy ? #% We should look at areas such as transmission losses , potential in the transport sector and where energy is going to come from when other sources are exhausted . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to commend Mrs Pack and Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee for their dedicated efforts to secure the best agreement on the second phase of the Socrates programme . #% Things have now ground to a halt and if Member States genuinely wish to create a citizens ' Europe the progress must be made in the area of justice and home affairs . #% Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add ' [ 18 months after the date of publication ] ' as the date for transposition . #% We should remember at this time that the European Union budget only amounts to a little more than 2 % of the overall spending undertaken by the 15 Member States of the Union in any given year . #% Last June 's referendum result was a major disappointment , particularly given the 30 % turnout . #% It has been in existence since the mid-1980s , and provides educational opportunities for students from within the European Union and the applicant states to study in different Member States . #% In relation to amendments which use the term ` Republic of Ireland ' , I would like to recall for colleagues that the official name of my country is Ireland . #% How can we ensure that we get a consensus that it is a fair and equitable distribution ? #% After all the anguish and despair of the last 30 years this is a wonderful tribute to the consistent belief on John Hume 's part that the non-violent path to peace in Northern Ireland was the only way . #% In recent weeks we witnessed the attempt to bring a flotilla of decrepit decommissioned US warships through EU waters . #% I think that is quite significant . #% While the top 20 % in the EU receive 73 % of direct aid , our farm survey shows that approximately 40 % of payments went to the 20 % of farmers with the highest family farm income . #% Introducing genetically modified fish into aquaculture is something that is extremely dangerous and should be avoided . #% Taoiseach , your government has cultivated Ireland 's image in Europe as a success story , the once poor nation made good , but this House deserves to know what lies behind this so-called success . #% It is unbelievable that we can not identify exactly where they are so that we can assist them . #% Mr Bowe has said that it is essential that the public should participate and also that there should be proper training . #% Part of this common position includes a complex derogation in respect of Ireland , Northern Ireland and Greece as well as further considerations for Luxembourg . #% Mr President , in my first remarks in the House I wish to state that the great sense of honour that I feel derives not from membership of this institution , but from the confidence in me manifested by the people of Northern Ireland in making me their first choice in terms of representation in this Parliament . #% Nevertheless , although it is relatively modest , it is welcome . #% First of all , what further guarantees have the American authorities given with regard to how the data will be used ? #% I believe that Israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of Lebanon . #% We must make sure that the actions we take will reverse the declines in several cod stocks and northern hake and allow them to recover . #% In the last session , when speaking on the Nitrates Directive , I stated that not even the European Parliament can legislate for weather across Europe and I have not changed my mind . #% The authors ' names must be on every impact assessment , so that we know where they come from and whether we believe vested interests are involved . #% I endorse very strongly what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have said on the need to keep people informed . #% Everyone involved in this crisis has suffered : producers , consumers and the ancillary industries . #% In Ireland some schools have been providing driving lessons as part of the transition year curriculum . #% Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further . #% I very much support the eEurope initiative which focuses on promoting broadband usage and which concentrates on those areas where the public sector can make a difference . #% Could I say also in regard to the hearings process which will be in two parts , i.e. written and oral , that we in the Liberal Group will want to know from each of the candidate Commissioners : ` What is the perspective that you will bring to Europe for Europe ? ' #% Instead , I am speaking as an MEP on behalf of myself and of my people . #% But it is a matter where circumstances may change . #% I hope everybody has heard that . #% There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality in the very near future . #% This has been a particularly bad year for the Middle East . #% I am glad that the parties who wanted this in have agreed to take it out , because it would be a really dangerous and very bad signal to send at this time to the military regime in Burma . #% Equality of access means that there should be no physical impediment towards people accessing training or employment opportunities . #% I do not wish to undermine the work of EWL it has a legitimate purpose and has a right to receive funding but I simply propose that the funding should also be available to other women 's organisations , who feel that EWL does not speak for them . #% There have been a lot of spurious arguments here tonight , particularly about thresholds for receiving funding . #% I have one reservation , however . #% Mr President , I wonder whether Members realize that the session is starting at this hour . #% What is being promoted here is a phoney and empty contrivance , designed to bring statehood to Europe . #% The net result has been that a group of perfectly talented Irish architects were discriminated against and their movement in the internal market curtailed . #% We have developed both informally and formally a considerable dialogue with aspects of the legislative process in the US , but as a parliamentary process it remains sub-optimal . #% In fact , it was so far down on the list that , naturally , it was not taken . #% Unfortunately we have had other experiences of loss of consumer confidence in other food products . #% Commission directorates must not shy away from a critical appraisal of their own policies and programmes , because only then can we get the right policies and programmes to secure the confidence of our citizens in the long term and after the reform of the funds in 1999 . #% The respective roles of the Council and the Commission , like all the institutions , are being examined by the Intergovernmental Conference . #% We in the ELDR Group believe that the Union 's job at this stage is to develop this new paradigm so that there is a sense of an enabling Europe : enabling our citizens to achieve their full potential . #% 
However , all I can say to Mr Fatuzzo is : `` veni , vidi , vici '' . #% Mr President , I should also like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur for a job well done and for his efforts to obtain consensus , which were not altogether successful in my case , as I continued to insist that we deal with a lower surface area than it was possible to agree on . #% We all hope for a successful negotiating process , which is due to be launched at an all-ACP level within the next couple of days . #% I certainly support every part of the resolution from all the groups concerned . #% We know that despite the ideology purveyed by the Tories in the United Kingdom who have lost two elections in a row based on their approach to the economy and the people of the United Kingdom . #% I strongly support paragraphs 16 and 17 , which call for informing the European public about scientific achievements and looking at ethical questions . #% Misuse of antibiotics in prophylactics or in therapy can never replace good management . #% Could I ask that this House move from making declarations to establishing an ad hoc committee so that we can prepare a common position for the European Union and the World Bank and then drive the Council and the Commission to adopt Parliament 's position on this issue ? #% My apologies - I got held up in traffic . #% The failures of those banks have brought on a crisis which continues to severely hurt citizens around the world . #% in writing . - I voted against the proposals to discharge the Commission of its obligation to report on its expenditure because the report was unclear . #% The conditions are deplorable from a health and safety point of view , if nothing else . #% Human population growth , poverty , bad governance , and the commercialisation of consumption and distribution of poached animals are the underlying causes of the bushmeat problem . #% Without a doubt computer-implemented inventions - genuine inventions which , in some cases , are the result of 10 to 15 years ' R&D investment - are important for the European economy . #% Additionally , the decision by the United Kingdom , Sweden and Denmark to opt out of the single currency did not prevent its establishment , which , given the magnitude of the technical problems involved , was a massive achievement by the Commission . #% Thus , in terms of those deprived areas of Belfast that I have mentioned , I certainly will be looking for a meaningful programme of assistance . #% The enlargement of the Union is an economic and political opportunity for Europe . #% If we allow human cloning to proceed under the guise of therapeutic cloning , we risk abuses which I fear would result in the production of a handicapped or impaired child . #% If we allow patents , how much of the creativity and freedom to think will be stifled by the fear of infringement of one of the hundreds of thousands of patents that will exist ? #% The fact that it has not been possible to deliver humanitarian aid in any structured manner to people in the Kosovo region does not reflect very well on us in this House . #% First of all , there is nothing wrong with legitimate arms trade and legitimate EU arms exports consistent with a working code of conduct . #% They have not yet been charged and there is no evidence of any possible serious charges against them . #% With 1 % of the Community 's population , to our shame we in Ireland have been generating 10 % of the Commission 's environmental complaints . #% It is this Parliament 's duty to help financially . #% Has there been some change in the status of the language ? #% Let us not forget that each Member State has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights , has incorporated it into its own national law and is bound by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . #% It will be available in any case . #% If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens . #% This legislation governing the issue of civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and accidents in Europe will ensure that the rights of the 370 million consumers in Europe will be enhanced in the case of accidents taking place within any of the territories of the European Union . #% It does not make me necessarily glad but , because of now leading the largest party in Northern Ireland , I have more duties at home and I feel I must attend to them , especially at this time when certain talks are taking place . #% This again draws attention to the whole thrust of the policy and whether or not we should review it with the idea of making it more compatible with regional policy and with social policy . #% Unfortunately , the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations . #% I am pleased that the report recognises the role played by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in maintaining employment in coastal , island and remote regions . #% An under-financed Union can not be successful . #% The Constitution was drafted in a uniquely democratic process and putting in place a Constitution for Europe by way of a binding treaty between sovereign states is the most important European decision citizens will make . #% Sanctions hurt the citizens , as has been said already here . #% The market neither rewards nor compensates farmers for these achievements in areas where farming is at a natural disadvantage . #% We must maintain and improve the incentive to work . #% Therefore I gladly support the proposal before us today . #% If the deaths of migrants in freight containers , on the undercarriages of trains or in ship holds in recent months demonstrates anything , it is that responses to economic migration based solely on the monitoring of the illegal movement of people will not prevent people from resorting to desperate measures to travel to Europe . #% I shall go one step further . #% The Irish people have not been allowed an adequate debate on the impact of the changes proposed in the Treaty of Nice upon Ireland ' s sovereignty and Independence . #% The decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with , I hope , new opportunities . #% That is for sure , but first we must put in place a more workable organisation that can deal with 148 members , many of whom do not have the technical expertise and resources to operate at full potential . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , the sovereign debt crisis will not be solved until the banks are sorted out , and you can not sort out the banks if regulators ' stress tests refuse to admit that the sovereign debt crisis exists . #% There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly . #% It would be incorrect for any interest group to read any other interpretation into the text . #% At a more central level , there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors , international NGOs , indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted . #% Therefore , on that score , I suppose I should say : let us have more of them ! #% We will need more and more speciality products if we are to meet the challenges in terms of the reform of the CAP and the pressures of the WTO . #% You will see in item 7 that I have been named as Mr rather than Mrs McNally . #% I voted in favour of this report , but I am disappointed that some of the most important aspects were rejected . #% This is the polite euphemism for corruption , and that is what we must control here . #% Is it the Commission ? #% We see examples of this across Europe . #% I repeat my specific request to the Irish presidency in July to prioritize the inclusion of a chapter in the Treaty containing provisions relating to the human rights of minors so that they would be entitled in the same way as any other citizen to enjoy fully the fundamental rights , freedoms and protection recognised by the Community , barring those restrictions , of course , laid down by the law specifically for children . #% As a result of the problem of mutual recognition of qualifications , many months passed before I was able to take up my position . #% It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed , and has been refused , permission to visit her . #% Lets put an end once and for all to our disgraceful record of broken promises and half-measures . #% I wanted to defend this Parliament ... #% Absolutely nothing has been done . #% Mr President , it is important that the European Parliament makes its views known on the deteriorating human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea . #% I want also to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her regular attendance at our meetings and for the help and expertise that her staff provided . #% It is not just about trading blocs . #% Some Member States and some NGOs have valiantly brought forward innovative initiatives to remove the barriers and obstacles to equal opportunity for all . #% Geography should not determine whether your disease goes into remission or progresses . #% 
Madam President , I should like to hear your comments on the European security and dining policy , which runs counter to the concept of a European security and defence policy that is for all and not just for some . #% They voted in favour of all of these things because they wish to continue supporting them . #% Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue . #% Would you not also agree that , while there is obviously some equipment which may or may not be used for torture , stun gun equipment is made to deliberately inflict pain on the person against whom it is used ; that up to 50 000 volts can be delivered to a person by a stun gun or by the stun belts which are also used ; and that it is inappropriate for equipment of this kind which is marketed by the manufacturers of these torture weapons to carry an EU quality mark as a sign of EU approval of these particular instruments of torture ? #% The campaign that must be waged against pirate fishing is a global and multifaceted one . #% This is our business , in the same way that what happens within the EU is Egypt 's business when it affects the agreements mentioned . #% They believe that the Oslo negotiations and the various Camp David discussions would have conferred legitimacy on such a step . #% And the Power of One is perhaps something we have not promoted enough . #% Health care and care of the elderly , whilst an important part of the overall health system , does not necessarily represent the overall health system . #% Do they not know that we have armed the perpetrators of this genocide for the last 25 years ? #% In the European Parliament , I wish to applaud the positive and supportive role of the European Union in this process . #% I very much regret that he is the victim of circumstances at this particular time . #% It seems to have been used as a bargaining chip , and it has taken no account of a sector that employs more than 60 000 fisherman and provides for some 400 000 jobs in the industry in that area . #% Those people are forgotten today in our discussions . #% This applies to both men and women . #% There was no consultation on Plan Colombia with the Colombian people , which is unacceptable . #% The UN believes that last year USD 2.3 billion were generated by the drug trade in the major opium-growing areas in Afghanistan . #% However , the traffic laws , roads , weather , etc. are so different that a national test and licence will remain essential for a driver . #% The United States is forging ahead , as is Japan . #% In the current climate of depressed prices and policy uncertainty , we are going to place our farmers at a further disadvantage . #% The European Parliament must make clear to the British Government that in order to comply with Article 2 , any tribunal must as a minimum have the characteristics identified by Judge Cory . #% In my own country of Ireland there are many teachers and students who can testify to its success as a unique learning experience . #% There were many diverse reasons for their ` no ' vote . #% Blanket secrecy is not the way to legitimise an evolving Community policy . #% However , in my contribution I want to draw attention to one point I feel has not been adequately dealt with . #% Mr Meehan has said to me that the SOLVIT system could benefit from joint cooperation with Europe Direct . #% It will require education and addressing the culture that we live in ; it requires addressing the attitudes of our media . #% By promoting higher safety standards and better pay , the EU is helping improve workers ' lives . #% In the meantime , even as I direct constituents to the Ombudsman , I will continue to insist on a return of power to the people , which will lead to a real democracy . #% We need to protect our fish stocks and not decimate them . #% They use it for bribery , corruption and the free flow of drugs and laundered money throughout the Community . #% It is to allow the fishermen , under the supervision already agreed at the early part of the closure , to continue right through that closure . #% Secondly , we also have a duty to ensure that the working environment and the ability to compete and to get a job within our Community is also made available and is as accessible as possible . #% I have a few points . #% Other worrying developments are the claims of police brutality made by Falangong practitioners who were refused entry to Macau during the visit of President Jiang and who were also denied the right to protest against the government 's crackdown on the group . #% All the various pacts and conventions are inadequate . #% Because the Commission is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of so many EU-sponsored policies , it should take particular note of its Treaty obligations in this regard . #% Mr President , hopefully it will be equally on time ! #% What we are talking about here are immigrant workers , under-age workers , temporary workers , and so on . #% We have seen the dramatic affect the Socrates programme has had in our own countries . #% While some political prisoners have been released , 1 000 remain in custody and political leaders continue to be sentenced to brutal prison sentences , some of up to 106 years . #% This is very important because intelligence agencies within the Union , together with Europol , have to work much more closely together in terms of exchanging and sharing information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken . #% The principal function of these Houses of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens . #% It can do so by working with the interim government which is to be formed in the next few days ; by supporting early elections ; and , most importantly , undertaking to fully respect the outcome of elections and working with the new administration that emerges from those elections . #% It is not acceptable that we should move by stealth to denying citizens their rights as citizens , which citizenship grants them in Europe , by making competition the only measure of service provision . #% Bland statements such as ` reducing demand is an important aspect ' is not good enough . #% There is no military solution to these problems , only peaceful solutions . #% Finally , it is very important that we introduce a promotional scheme right away to try and stimulate the consumption of beef . #% We must take some of them ourselves . #% It is not enough that we have these small , under-funded programmes . #% Punitive and deterrent justice through the criminal courts is much the best option . #% I also welcome the focus on the sharing of best practices and the rights of sufferers and their families . #% I agree with Mr Martínez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims . #% Secondly , the average cost increase for firms in this study would be in excess by about a hundred times that of the study carried out by the EC which stated that it would be 0.2 % . #% But fishermen , generally speaking , do not appreciate what we and the Commissioner have been trying to do on their behalf . #% Mr President , Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years , dealing with three areas in fisheries management : first , the size of the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP ; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission ; and satellite transponders , an important aspect of the overall control programme . #% This IGC will examine what key amendments must be made to the body of EU legislation to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union . #% It would certainly be a serious mistake to allow the current crisis to panic us into introducing drastic budget changes which would militate against the sustainability of European family farming . #% Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources , the practice of direct dumping with little thought to the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable . #% I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on feeding fishmeal to young calves that have high protein requirements . #% It makes no sense to me whatsoever to be reluctant to promote that . #% I totally agree with the comments of my colleague , Mr Poettering , when he criticised them for setting themselves up as the custodians of morality in this House . #% My original amendment on this issue at committee stage was not adopted , but its wording could provide a solution to this major problem . #% Why have a section , under other questions -- part three -- which should have had half an hour , and then ignore it ? #% The system is already generating angry criticism of farmers as the amounts of these payments are identified separately from the costs of products that farmers produce and are seem by some as handouts . #% The rights of children as European citizens must be fully safeguarded . #% 
The vote on this report will show who in practice is in favour of freedom of competition when it serves consumers and small businesses and who , on the other hand , supports legal protection of multinational monopolies . #% That 's the only way we can offer them real pain relief instead of simply deferring and dragging out their suffering ! #% Despite the risks and the dangers which new advances and new technologies present , they also offer us a wonderful new opportunity to correct some of the errors of the past , to be more socially cohesive within Europe . #% If the worst were to happen , and this package were rejected , another 20 years of negotiations would take place , resulting in a similar package and resulting in the same reservations that have been expressed . #% You have to build consensus here or you fail . #% The Indonesians have forced the international community to turn a blind eye to what is going on there , and they hold the international community to ransom . #% Our debate should focus not on argument about timetables , but on the reduction of the overall level of packaging and packaging waste through recycling and recovery . #% Each Member State is trying to deal with the problem as best it can . #% Whole political and social scenes will be criminalised . #% Let us realign the Fifth Frame Work Programme in its mid-term towards much more research into and development of those alternatives . #% Racist incidents that have taken place at European football matches include the following acts : monkey-like chanting , derisive singing , the hanging of banners that reflect neo-fascist beliefs and the tossing of banana skins on to football pitches . #% Finally , I also believe it was a serious mistake to back off from a decision to nominate a European Union peace-keeping force for Afghanistan under a UN mandate . #% Many years ago somebody asked me what I thought were the five most important environmental issues of our time . #% We can have more influence over them through the present vehicle than we could have otherwise . #% The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials , and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials , including MOX fuels . #% We must therefore do more than simply put security measures in place . #% Furthermore , we should get it into our heads that we are not running economies , we are running states . #% It crosses all parties ; it crosses all Member States . #% I know some progress has been made in identifying the virus , but what progress has been made in identifying a vaccine for us ? #% Every image of the dead in Gaza inflames people across the Arab world , and I am worried that the essential tenet of the Middle East peace process is slipping away : the so-called two-state solution , an independent Palestinian state coexisting in peace with Israel . #% The Irish also had further concerns in relation to domestic support , the redemption of the ` bluebox ' and the exemption from reduction commitments of direct payments which are of vital importance to our farmers . #% The European Commission , in its communication on the renewed social agenda , states : ` The Commission calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions that are up to date ' . #% Much can be gained from establishing partnerships between sporting organisations and educational establishments . #% People want a reliable postal service which will deliver their mail with the minimum of fuss and which will keep local post offices at the centre of the communities they serve . #% It would seem that at the instigation of Ms Patricia McKenna , the Greens broke this understanding . #% Such is the case with the British government 's nuclear installation at Sellafield . #% Above all , the EU needs to retain the trust of European farmers . #% Issues of personal morality are not matters to be legislated for by the Commission , nor for us here ; they are for our national governments and private individuals to decide . #% It should be noted that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics is not confined to farmers and the agricultural industry : there is plenty of evidence that the medical profession does not have clean hands when it comes to over-prescription . #% Two months ago employees were given notice that the plant would close this December . #% There has been no agreement to date on whether or not the European Union should appoint a special representative for Iraq . #% Although the Ukraine authorities have pledged to dismantle the plant by the year 2000 in exchange for international aid for the harnessing of alternative sources of energy , closure can not come quick enough . #% Madam President , last Sunday I returned from Iran following a political visit by Irish Members of Parliament to that country . #% I would , however , like to sound a note of caution . #% I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to the situation of the people in Vietnam as a result of the floods . #% Indeed , the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU . #% Some Members of this House took a ridiculous approach in saying I should be recommending that people eat more oranges and vegetables . #% Indeed , having been at the centre of compromise , finding and supporting others , I was surprised that my modest proposals did not receive proper consideration . #% I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks . #% I do not want to be nationalistic . #% We must do more to advance the Lisbon strategy so as to ensure the Union becomes the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another . #% It achieved a lot in terms of finalising the overall financial parameters for spending within the EU for the seven-year period after 1999 . #% Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 . #% The two institutions will now agree to extend constructive dialogue and political cooperation , to improve the flow of information and to consult and inform Parliament on administrative reform within the Commission . #% If there will be outside technical assistance , who will be operating it ? #% Last June , Senegal suspended negotiations until October in order to gain time to analyse the fisheries issues and their effects . #% Effective leadership for all our credit unions on the island of Ireland is provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions . #% Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils , which will have an extremely important role to play . #% There is , however , a need for continued , detailed debate on one issue in particular , a CCCTB . #% We need a high-quality European social model which uses social infrastructure as a building block for a prosperous and fair society . #% We should not accept that the Chinese policy of exporting arms remain shrouded in secrecy . #% The internet genie is out of the bottle : some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers . #% It is basically criminalising victims , people who are seeking asylum and refuge . #% Let us say somebody comes to Ireland for a few years to earn some money . #% If the European Union , in a democratic process , decides that own resources are simply a straight percentage of GDP collected by the Member States and passed over in a lump sum , that is fair enough : that is what own resources are and that is democratic . #% I support the position that EU spending should remain as a percentage of gross domestic product and should not be stabilised at current spending levels . #% They work on the basis of differing protection standards and outside true democratic and legal scrutiny . #% I wish him every success in his presidency on behalf of the people of Europe . #% Whilst there has been a downward trend in corporate tax rates in some Member States , this has been accompanied by both a widening of corporate tax bases and an improvement in the underlying company profitability . #% It is interesting to hear the Commission say that they should not get involved . #% This is a packet of Viagra , now available over the Internet . #% I have also received the same notice as Mr McMahon and I agree with him fully . #% It takes place at an important watershed with the reform of the structural and regional policies and the Agenda 2000 package . #% China has given undertakings in the Sino-British Declaration that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy , except for foreign and defence affairs . #% I would like to seek an assurance from you , given what you did say , that in future Member States will take a strong stance in their discussions with China where the abuse of human rights are concerned and will not be blackmailed by any economic threats by China in this regard . #% 
He absconded to the United States where he has decided to stay and has not come back to face the consequences of his action , even despite warrants from Interpol . #% Firstly , let me say that in spite of the hurried nature of this debate , I welcome the fact that it is taking place . #% The emphasis given to coordinating and developing all services involved in the elimination of drug trafficking and organized crime is also welcome . #% Dublin Airport Authority ( DAA ) has tendered a contract , worth up to EUR 2 million , for body scanners at Dublin airport . #% In a Union which will have nearly 500 million inhabitants in 2007 , the new programmes will form part of a new approach , building bridges between cultures and individuals . #% Would you not agree that the experience to date of the Posting of Workers Directive indicates that amendments are required in order to clarify the application of that directive to the delivery of services from third countries , such as Turkey , and also from some other Member States ? #% With the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation . #% While the European economy is performing strongly , we must equally ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a structured and streamlined manner . #% However , this should only be the first step to deal with it , both at European and international level . #% I am pleased we have been able to find a compromise at second reading between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers by working very quickly and in fact by foregoing the normal full procedure for codecision matters . #% The United Nations is organising an international appeal for humanitarian and other aid . #% Some say we can not afford such new financing . #% He is now subject to emergency regulations , which constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment , even though he has served his sentence -- incidentally for revealing details of the kind of weapons that the US is seeking to discover in Iraq . #% I welcome the fact that the Irish Government is now going to establish a national forum on Europe to encourage everyone to reflect sensibly on the challenge , the message and the means of reconnecting people with the European vision . #% Your words , President-in-Office , about fruitful discussions , re-focusing on key issues , sustainable growth in employment etc. etc. etc. , could be those of any President-in-Office over the last four years : they have all said exactly the same . #% Like my colleague , Mr De Rossa , I did not have time to speak in the House yesterday . #% There has been a unity of purpose and conviction from the beginning of my involvement - and I know that that goes back many years before I joined this Parliament last summer . #% The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan , with 117 , which just beats Spain into first place . #% Peace can only be built on parity of esteem , where there is respect for the territorial integrity and the rights of each group . #% Within the highest safety standards , we must encourage and support research and ensure that the industry is not bogged down with so many restrictions that laboratories will move their research out of Europe altogether and cause a brain drain and loss of highly trained people and highly skilled jobs . #% Mr President , I would like to join colleagues in expressing my admiration to Commissioner Gradin and to Mrs Waddington for this excellent report . #% They agreed that the dual legal base , as proposed in the common position , should remain . #% Many years ago , a greater Irishman than I am said , ` Nobody or no group has the right to put a stop on the march of a nation ' . #% We must come to the conclusion , that our responsibility , as Mr Stevenson has said , is to get down to the substance and work with the Commission and the Council to come forward with a policy that hopefully will be infinitely better than the previous one . #% This trend towards cobbling together sloppy compromises at the Council negotiating table when Member States can not reach an acceptable political agreement is extremely worrying . #% It is a moderate approach which can be stepped up or cancelled when progress is made by Israel in withdrawing her troops from the Palestinian area , giving free access to humanitarian aid and free access to the United Nations mission in Jenin and elsewhere . #% Furthermore he stated he did not intend to stand down at a specific moment in time . #% Products which have been widely and safely used for many years in several EU Member States are being restricted without any health and safety justifications . #% I want to raise that matter with you now for the benefit of the other Members of this House who felt exactly the same way . #% Taxation is a Member State competence , not an EU one , and any reference to a CCCTB inevitably brings concerns about EU corporate tax rates , which is not something I can support . #% I hope that you will agree with me , Commissioner , that in the current context that will be a small price to pay . #% Fair Trade 's significant worldwide growth in 2005 also shows that more and more producers , traders and suppliers trust the Fair Trade certificate mark and like to join the system . #% But I think we need to re-examine the effect these changes have made in the industry . #% Mr President , I was always amazed at the Commissioner 's optimism throughout these talks . #% The point of substance about the role of the Commission is that it is at the heart and core of the European project - and it is indispensably so - and that is the structure of truth which we must promote , defend and constantly revisit . #% You passed over my Question 39 . #% Perhaps the timing was not right , maybe I should table this question again in June , so that he could outline even further what the Council should have done and account for its stewardship over a six-month period . #% The Irish presidency must concentrate on a sound framework for European research and innovation . #% The challenge that you undertake is at the core of what we do . #% One of my constituents had difficulty in having a blue disabled badge issued in Germany : Mrs Nuttall was informed that she had to be a resident in Germany . #% However , in determining what the financial perspective should be , the onus must be on the Member States to come up with a package , because once again they are the paymasters of future European Union action . #% Madam President , dear Nicole , my Group supported you at the outset . #% It is no great victory for Irish fishermen , because there will be no fish to catch ! #% I was guided by these particular principles when I voted on this important report . #% The Union has made a judgment in relation to the customs union for example which this House has ratified and endorsed . #% I urge that we in this House keep the pressure on to ensure that this facility is made available to the poorest of the poor . #% One simply can not adopt an à la carte approach . #% However , this increase in visitor numbers is masking an underlying trend , a striking regional imbalance . #% Finally , I would like to see us aim for a situation where the Court of Auditors would present us with a statement which could be read in reasonable time by members of the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% Perhaps at last , with the adoption of this report , we can deliver a result for two-time petitioner , my constituent Peter Downes , whose son suffered fatal head injuries in a horse riding accident and has campaigned tirelessly ever since for an improvement in safety standards . #% But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment . #% The Commission measures proposed to allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU , and a selection of other animals that are classified as pets as well . #% We must ensure that our ports and airports are properly controlled in every way . #% Rural areas are different from urban areas , but the policy priorities for rural regions have to fit in with the overall objectives , as you have set out , of competitiveness and economic growth , environmental sustainability and quality-of-life issues . #% The export to regimes with poor human rights records would be allowed if the weapons were to be used to protect the police . #% I welcome the fact that a fundamental basis for this negotiation is a strengthening and deepening of political dialogue , an element which had been largely missing in the previous discussions . #% Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development . #% However , we must accept as credible the explanation given by the Commission , which I certainly do . #% I would prefer this Parliament 's decision to prevail and I can not put my name to a regulation that is not legally sound and will not withstand legal scrutiny . #% Please , MEPs , do not try to tell your constituents that it is the economic boom in Ireland that is taking jobs out of your constituencies . #% The ELDR recognises that the primary responsibility for employment creation rests with Member States . #% I come from Ireland , a country whose economy has been transformed from little more than that of a poor , Third World country into one of the strongest in Europe , courtesy of European assistance through membership , and I wish all the same benefits and success to our ten new neighbours . #% That is only the tip of the iceberg , because there are thousands of women and children and young people who are being abused constantly . #% Mr President , I would like you to take note that under the new rules by the Bureau I am present but I am not participating in this vote . #% Furthermore , they need to look at their criminal code sections on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws can not be applied against those merely exercising their right to freedom of expression , as well as at the administrative detention directive which allows for the detaining of individuals for up to two years . #% This assumption is open to question in my view . #% 
Mr President , I support Commissioner Monti 's initiative and I am pleased that his Commission colleagues are also supporting him . #% Unfortunately it is clear that nuclear energy will continue to be Ukraine 's electricity plan for the future , so high engineering and security standards must be paramount in all other nuclear sites if a repetition of the 1986 disaster is to be avoided . #% Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force , I do not want to exaggerate its importance . #% When we vote on those my group will expect to hear from you a specific detailed and positive response before our final vote . #% But the core question is : who is responsible ? #% We see Member State governments -- the Swedish Government in particular -- utilising an opportunity given to it by the Socialist Group in this Parliament to express its opposition to the Services Directive when , for three years , it has been in favour of that directive . #% All countries , regardless of their size , influence or form of government should begin a process of decommissioning their nuclear arsenals as soon as possible . #% Better maternity leave is an investment in the future good health of our society . #% Mr President , in isolated coastal communities such as my own constituency , there are very limited possibilities for locally-based economic development initiatives . #% I therefore fully support the compromise proposal to be brought forward tomorrow because it is important that we act with some urgency on this issue . #% We must try to reduce the number of vehicles on our roads , but there is no guarantee that this directive would do that . #% We must promote them . #% While there is unanimous approval for REACH 's aims , there is far less agreement over the means of achieving them , especially regarding the obligations it imposes on the chemical and pharmaceutical industries . #% The European Union has a terrific responsibility in this regard . #% Our Member States - and we have some influence there - should start removing some of those barriers . #% Finally , I attach the utmost importance to the contribution of the European Parliament to the reform of the Cohesion Fund in the coming months . #% In a report produced by the European Liaison Committee for Social Housing to mark the United Nations Year of Older Persons , one of the main recommendations is that governments and service providers should help people to stay in their own communities as they get older . #% in writing . - I support this report on the future of credit rating agencies ( CRAs ) . #% It is very well to say that the scrapping of vessels and the removal of extra capacity will lead to increased profitability , whereas in reality many a coastal community has been devastated by such a move . #% Mr President , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a major threat to the world . #% The problems encountered on these islands , notably off the south-west and west coast of Ireland are not acceptable by any Community standard . #% The voluntary maximum working hours negotiated by the Irish medical organisation and our department of health is 35 hours per week averaged over their rota period of 46 hours and not more than 72 hours work continuously . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work and particularly the excellent definition of renewables . #% We are aware of the significant growth in the EU audiovisual market - 16 % per annum - which makes it the fastest growing audiovisual market in the world . #% I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken on board the amendment drafted by Mr Crowley and myself . #% What does that tell us about political interference from the top in France ? #% All too often in Member States , the abduction of a child is treated by the police and other authorities simply as a domestic rather than a criminal matter . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , despite the short time available to me , there are three points that I want to raise . #% We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue . #% in writing . - Deputy Locatelli 's report is part of the review of the Lisbon Strategy to make Europe 's economy the most competitive in the world by 2010 , and central to this is the position of researchers in Europe . #% Our experience in Northern Ireland should demonstrate that there is nothing honourable , enlightened or desirable about pandering to terrorism or finding excuses for it -- it is evil in all its forms . #% It must be taken relative to the cattle population in each country . #% In the past few years he has rescued many children and has set up the orphanage in Olongapo City in the Philippines . #% However , it will probably be the corporations , rather than the people , which will benefit from this , and many of them will not even be owned by nationals . #% To this end , publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information , for example emergency phone contact numbers . #% I just want to make it clear to Mrs Schreyer that , as far as I am concerned , if the money goes into the reserve , it is perfectly reasonable for them to be funding things such as HIV and AIDS in the developing world , particularly in Africa . #% There are over 50 000 carers for dementia suffers and an estimated 100 000 people are directly affected by dementia . #% To my mind that seems to contradict what they are saying in this debate . #% Along with my colleagues , I will support the measures looking for increased funding to be made available . #% This happened when Egyptian security forces evacuated by force about 2500 Sudanese migrants , refugees and asylum seekers who had settled in front of the UNHCR headquarters , requesting to be relocated to third countries . #% If not NATO there was nothing . #% I am , therefore , going to speak personally . #% You already have some idea what the external audit is going to say with regard to the future operation of the programme . #% We all have blood on our hands because of the slow international response to what has happened to date . #% Finally , the opportunity that is now presented by this decision from ETA is a groundbreaking one , but do not forget that opportunity comes to pass , not to pause : we must grasp it now and work to fulfil the ideas within it . #% Is that the price to be paid for jingoism of this kind ? #% Last week I met with the Abusive Images Unit of Greater Manchester Police , a small , committed team led by Terry Jones , leading the field in expertise in the UK on tracing and convicting child abusers on the net . #% That , in itself , is vital for Europe 's potential for economic growth in the future . #% I regret though that the resolution on this important subject was misused as a vehicle to attack internal government composition in Member States , which is the product of the democratic process and , frankly , beyond the remit of the European Parliament . #% The national cap on allowances can start from the 2003 emissions level and not from that of 1990 , provided that the allowances are decreased to the Kyoto figure by 2012 . #% This State aid was approved by the European Commission . #% But I suppose we should not be surprised : Mr Sharon 's own terrorist behaviour in Lebanon , when he permitted the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps , was subsequently condemned by Israel 's Kahane Commission of Inquiry . #% I am asking for a statement . #% Mr Barroso , your recent statements on the Lisbon strategy and the economic way forward for Europe have been very positive , and I wish you well . #% The citizens ' initiative is a valuable tool by which citizens can achieve ambitious results through teamwork - this is the essence of the European project . #% We are lucky to have two committed men , both of whom realise the importance of science . #% There is an urgent need now for united action by the European and Canadian trade union movement , with environmental and indigenous activists , to fight together and resist this proposed agreement . #% This programme , I am sad to say , has been cut by the Council . #% It would be foolish and foolhardy to believe that the current level of budget support for agriculture will continue indefinitely . #% I should like to say , in respect of enlargement , that my group , as the others too have expressed here today , is extremely pleased to see that negotiations will open soon with the six additional States of Central and Eastern Europe . #% Having listened to Mr Gomolka 's contribution I am even more disturbed that we are not going to give due reflection to this dossier . #% These countries -- for years many of them locked in the iron grip of Moscow -- have joined the most unique and successful experiment in the history of democratic politics . #% I have known her for many years . #% It is a figure drawn from thin air which somehow gives the impression that pesticide use is inherently bad . #% I should also like to know if the Commission has any legal advice on this matter . #% We have aimed at the target of improved energy efficiency in buildings for some years , in the climate change programme amongst others . #% 
While acknowledging Commissioner Fischler 's concern and efforts in modifying regulations to ease the burden for farmers , the reality is that beef , sheep and pigs are being sold at a loss or at best at marginal profits . #% In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland , for example , English companies certainly operate there . #% Undisputed statistics clearly demonstrate , since the setting up of the Thorp plant , wholesale increases in the amount of nuclear materials found in concentrations in seaweed in Ireland . #% It is essential that police cooperation in connection with Europol be extended to new areas such as counterfeiting Euro notes and coins . #% The onus is on the European Union to tackle the pollution which is causing health problems and which could be avoided . #% I could not help but think that many of those same ministers allocated billions to support banks , but were unable to support other financial institutions that would provide micro-credit to those who have lost their jobs and who would have difficulty in accessing credit from the same banks that have been saved . #% However , I wish to pay tribute to my colleagues in the Committee on Development - Members who did not allow pressure to divide us , across all groups , and who , in the end , carried the day . #% It is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted . #% Mr President , I too would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on his speed and efficiency with regard to this programme and also to thank the Commissioner for her initiative in recognising the opportunities offered by information technology . #% I always tell the story of the first time I came here in 1979 . #% If this process is to be a success , we must achieve progress along the political , economic and security tracks at all costs . #% There must be far greater local participation in these decisions . #% Mr President , the problem of global warming is one that the European Union can not ignore . #% Simply put , in the case of agreements there must be clear scientific proof that added fishing pressure from proposed EU activities will not compromise sustainability of fish stocks . #% If they are representing the Commission , we need to know what happens at these Bilderberg meetings because at the end of the day this is a secret organisation which is deciding global policy without any input from the public . #% Where I come from -- and I am going to be parochial for a little while -- we are lucky to have any rail links left at all . #% It is a call for real peace . #% The report on temporary protection represents the recognition of the desire at the level of the European Union for a coordinated joint action to deal with the situation where there is a sudden mass influx of displaced persons resulting from an armed conflict in their own countries . #% On my first day in Parliament the good wishes and support of the Irish Members of the European Parliament are particularly welcome and have been a great source of help to me . #% Europe must protect regions like the west and north-west of Ireland , particularly as regards the settlement pattern , which can only be sustained by balanced regional development . #% The atmosphere here today is muted , but that must not disguise the fact that the European Union does have a lead role to play in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people will be fully addressed . #% Mr President , I , too , wish to welcome my Dublin colleague , Ruairi Quinn , the Irish Minister for Finance and the President-in-Office of Ecofin , to Parliament this afternoon . #% Someone in the middle is profiteering . #% However , the opportunity is there to be seized and we have to ask whether we can get things right this time . #% Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit . #% Medicine should be kept out of food . #% My only difference with the rapporteur is in relation to paragraphs 7 and 10 , where there is a call for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office . #% For months in this House the college of Commissioners has suffered from a self-induced collapse in its credibility . #% I was in Strasbourg yesterday evening but I omitted to sign . #% I was one of Parliament 's observers at the elections there last year . #% Given the number of computers in homes , schools , workplaces , etc. , you can see how the savings mount up from the good sleeping habits of those machines . #% I ask the Commissioner to do something about that urgently or all this legislation -- framework directives , water directives and so on -- will come to nought . #% It is wholly unacceptable to have Chinese Christians in prison for merely expressing their Christian beliefs or distributing copies of the Bible . #% Consumers remain confused and bewildered . #% Item No 5 which is listed under the heading China is in fact a call for political solidarity by European Member States with those states threatened by Chinese retaliation in trade or other terms as a result of the UN Human Rights Conference in Geneva . #% Arrears for those countries which were at $ 1.2 billion in 1980 have now increased to $ 43 billion . #% In particular , I am pleased with the recommendation that any mandatory changes be introduced gradually and requiring an initial transitional period , in order to allow sufficient time for the industry , and especially individual fishermen , to cope with the extra expense in an already difficult industry . #% I will come straight to the point I have difficulty with , and I support completely what colleagues - in particular Mr Bowis - have said . #% The Commission must be given a central coordinating role in public health to deal with illnesses , from detecting their origin to their actual treatment . #% The third area concerns the impact that conflict situations have on women and children , leading to tragic consequences on a regular basis . #% I deeply regret that the People 's Republic of China has now carried out a nuclear test after the conclusion of the NPT Conference . #% Mr President , I should first like to thank Mr Rehder for his work . #% It was a difficult conference because there were long , tortuous and turgid negotiations but I can not but support Mr Spencer and congratulate the Commission . #% We have failed them , failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available . #% In Berlin we did not foresee that we were going to have a foot-and-mouth crisis and we did not foresee the BSE crisis either . #% Just as I would criticise the United States , I am not blind to the inconsistency of the EU on these issues - the Council in particular . #% This year has seen the implementation of some very wide-ranging and aggressive policies which are all going to play a role in developing the economies within the fifteen Member States of the European Union . #% Mr President , I would like to associate myself with the remarks of other Members of the House about the colleague of the lady from Scotland who has just spoken . #% At last the British Government has produced a fairly detailed programme for the eradication of BSE . #% I voted for a fair statute for all Members which must go hand in hand with a fair , honest and open expenses regime . #% I am also sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not approve moving the training of the nuclear inspectorate in the former Soviet Union from the external policy to the energy line where that training could be done far more efficiently . #% It is essential that , not only in presenting a new opportunity to Kosovo , we also take into consideration the unique and special concerns that Serbia has . #% I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences , some of which are very serious . #% The Greek Government has worked very closely with all the representatives on the EU Convention and this has contributed in ensuring a new draft Treaty that will pave the way for new structures within the Union . #% Two weeks after the world is advised of the most brutal genocide following elections in an attempt to establish the very essence of democracy which we , as Parliamentarians , above all should uphold , we are not yet in gear and not seen as relevant to the solution by any commentators . #% The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general . #% I consider that Parliament must continue to press for ratification by the Yemen of important international human rights conventions and continue to take up individual cases of human rights abuses as they are presented to us . #% The draft revision of the Treaties which was presented to the Dublin Summit by the Intergovernmental Conference represents a solid basis from which to proceed to the final and most controversial stage of the negotiations on a new Treaty . #% The head of the company was supposed to be arrested and a warrant was issued for his arrest . #% I am also concerned at the grandstanding by some Member States , which are resisting the budgetary commitments needed for the successful development of the accession countries ' economies . #% A similar problem . #% However , as was said on a number of occasions in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we are starting with a flawed proposal . #% My purpose in being here is to defend and promote the interests and good name of Northern Ireland and to secure for its people their fair share of European funding . #% However , looking at the current packaging directive and at compliance with it , and just looking at my own country Ireland and a number of others , for example Portugal and Greece - they are all now looking for derogations for extra time . #% It is particularly important for our new Member States , which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people , goods and services for so long . #% Why is the family looking for justice here ? #% 
Unemployment still remains at over 9 % within the European Union which is unacceptably high . #% If we get it right , we can open up the market , boost jobs and growth across the EU and help Europe compete globally with the booming services market in India and China . #% It is quite clear that there is no international legality for the invasion and current occupation of Iraq . #% For the continent of Africa this pandemic is already amplifying the impact of famine which is now threatening so many countries in Africa itself . #% If this incident , with the consequences it had for the shared environment and European fishing industries , had occurred in EU waters , and if an EU coastguard had existed , the response time would have been reduced , a refuge port would have been designated and the damage could have been minimised . #% For that reason I would like to take this opportunity , even though I know the subject is probably more appropriately dealt with in the report on marital cooperation in legal issues which we will be dealing with at the next part-session . #% I would particularly like to put a supplementary to the Council representative on the issue of the temporary agency workers directive . #% I was putting the whole thing in context . #% The cease-fire announced by Islamic Jihad and Hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on Israel . #% However , when the role of the entrepreneur or business in creating jobs is taken away , then the reality of the employment-creation quandary is undermined . #% Could I remind the IGC of another Irish poet , William Butler Yeats , who warned the founders of the Irish state to tread softly as they tread on our dreams . #% This is why I retabled the relevant amendment from first reading , which we overwhelmingly adopted first time round . #% We very much welcome and deeply thank the Commission for this , and the Council of Ministers for the Special Peace Programme for Northern Ireland . #% How can we stand by and watch starvation in many African countries , while the leaders are laden with the trappings of exceptional wealth ? #% They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments . #% This will speed up negotiations within Parliament and with the other institutions once we have received formal proposals . #% The codecision procedure covers a wide range of activities including those in the transport sector , regional affairs , social matters , employment initiatives , structural funding , consumer protection , public health and environmental concerns . #% SME restructuring and redundancies in smaller Member States , which has a serious impact on national , regional and local economies , will benefit very little from the EGAF . #% We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States . #% It is vital that the Irish Box is maintained as a biologically sensitive zone . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and for the information . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her answer . #% Today 40-50 % of plasma products used each year by European patients come from plasma donors who are compensated for their time and inconvenience for this lengthy process . #% It is this rapid evolution of the virus that makes it such a potential threat . #% If this is to be maintained , it is important that degressivity is not introduced after 2006 . #% We must also take account of cases of cancellation or long delays due to valid technical reasons for safety . #% Some of these are extremely problematic sites . #% Yet I am sure you will agree with me that it is scandalous and shocking that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the UK and the spokesperson for small businesses , Angela Knight MP , an MP in my own Euro-constituency , said that the Treasury 's late payment on 25 % of its bills is not exactly the crime it has been portrayed as . #% The European Union space policy , for example , is heavily oriented towards security and defence applications such as signals . #% Significant price fluctuations are occurring from year to year , and indeed from month to month , and are often due to factors beyond our control , such as the global financial crisis and , indeed , the price of oil . #% In my own region , north-west England , trading standards intellectual property groups ' seizures of counterfeited pirate goods is on the increase . #% Do you apply the rule that a person is innocent until proven guilty - which exists in the common law system - or do you apply another legal basis which exists in other Member States of the Union ? #% The heads of state and government must first of all allay the fears which have been raised and in this regard the efforts to develop a stability pact are welcome . #% For this reason , my group has tabled an amendment which proposes excluding lime and dolime production from the gas emissions trading scheme . #% Moreover , global standards on liquidity management are proposed . #% The NLD has called for Parliament to be convened by 21 August and has also repeatedly called on the military rulers to engage in dialogue . #% The third option put forward by the Commission , developing the 1992 approach , has positive elements since it involves the development of an integrated rural policy . #% Mr President , the sole purpose of this resolution is to achieve justice for the McCartney family -- whom I welcome here this evening -- by insisting that normal policing and judicial procedures be allowed to take their course in relation to the murder of their brother Robert . #% Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , it is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to the Swedish presidency on the tremendous successes it has achieved on behalf of us all . #% I am especially satisfied that the European LIFE programme has promoted the use of cleaner technologies and has also financially supported many waste recycling programmes . #% It is important to explain to EU citizens that they can only enjoy free trade and the benefits that it brings if they are prepared to have a body to enforce discipline and fairness . #% I admire Mr Cook for his condemnation of the slaughter in Kosovo . #% Because this is causing major problems to the mobility of our citizens , particularly the disabled and the invalided , in the areas I have referred to . #% That should also be investigated . #% Every time the European Parliament has debated this issue there have been increasing doubts as to the safety of these toys which derive from PVC . #% We make tyres with them , but we also create them when we burn waste . #% Some of the root causes of violence ( occupation , injustice , social and economic causes ) are barely mentioned . #% How much of this came from the European Council inviting the Commission to take initiatives ? #% Recently the German Government has been doing U-turns and going through all sorts of contortions in relation to the whole nuclear issue . #% I would fully agree with you . #% I am calling on the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership to take the necessary steps to re-establish mutual confidence , accept the need to make concessions and focus on the overriding goal of achieving lasting peace and stability in the region . #% Secondly , in relation to commitments we are making , I am very glad to hear what the Commissioner had to say about the EUR 200 million which he is forwarding almost immediately . #% I am therefore sickened that anybody should expect that their republicanism can be used as an excuse for violent and despicable acts of murder , particularly in the case of Robert McCartney . #% So I would agree with that particular section of Amendment No 1 . #% These are questions which I think all European citizens want to have answered . #% As I said , the rule must be that if Council is involved , Parliament is involved . #% When I raise the problem of the Commission coming forward with concrete proposals - be it set-aside or support mechanisms - the Commission says : '' let the national authorities come forward with ideas and we will take them on board in a very positive way . '' #% I offer my support to the reports which have been submitted . #% Despite all these problems , labelling has an important role and should apply to all food products including alcoholic beverages . #% EU bilateral trade relations with third parties are all the more crucial for human rights and social and environmental standards when there is scant prospect of progress within the WTO framework . #% The Finnish Presidency of the EU , together with the Commission , should review progress that is being made on this important issue across the EU so that consumer concerns about the new euro currency are fully addressed . #% A year ago , I spoke in Parliament in relation to this particular matter and my views were clearly laid out . #% However , the deadline being set down for the next intergovernmental conference is very ambitious indeed . #% As someone who also comes from Northern Ireland , during the earlier part of my 16 years in this House , I had to rise nearly every month to express condolences to the people of my area . #% I am a great supporter of President Barroso 's plan with regard to the necessity for Europe to take the lead and take the leap from the 20th century into the 22nd century with regard to what we need to do for research and development and investment in technology . #% In the past few months the political process in Kosovo has suffered serious reversals and has not progressed . #% 
The Palestinians have been unable to fulfil many of their commitments on the crucial issue of security . #% In spite of the rapid advance of the grey squirrel , our Commission has not carried out comprehensive research to map or to control the spread of this species . #% That false message must not be allowed to be sent out from this Parliament . #% There is no way that can be held to be acceptable . #% I am extremely pleased that no initiatives were taken on the environment sector and the reference period projects relating to coastal erosion are notable , something I have been advocating for a long time . #% The Irish presidency will explore through this group the extent to which the basis for an agreement exists among partners and will endeavour to secure a decision . #% I also wish to say , as have other speakers , that , after the meeting on Monday night , I am not completely convinced by President Barroso 's position on the resources . #% If the policy is to be correctly implemented and used for the benefit of European citizens , the Acts which it has created must be relevant to the world of agriculture as it is today . #% As the drugs market in his area is legal , there is no need for him to go chasing a share of the market illegally . #% Finally , I would urge the Belgian presidency to ensure that the difficult chapters of negotiation with the applicant countries are opened as soon as possible . #% Environmental scaremongering hampers open debate by inflating a stateable risk , for example the presence of a toxin , so that it becomes an inaccurately perceived threat , for example by failing to acknowledge that the quantity of the toxin falls significantly below any threatening dose . #% In this regard the bio-industry has itself contributed in no small way to public unease by the planned introduction of unacceptable practices such as seed-terminator technology and other ethical issues such as experimentation with human embryos . #% As a mutually beneficial agreement advancing scientific knowledge and technological progress , I am very pleased to support this measure . #% Secondly , I may have misinterpreted what he said in his original answer , but am I right to understand that the criteria for the definition of SMEs and micro-enterprises will be updated and evaluated every year ? #% We should not underestimate the seriousness of the situation . #% I have been arguing for the creation of an EU coastguard for some time , and welcome Mr Pex 's acknowledgement that such a body has an important role to play in implementing these rules by carrying out spot checks . #% Several Member States are behind in their obligations to reduce their fleets and once again nothing is being done to improve matters . #% They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that . #% We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth ? #% The status quo is no longer an option . #% It is very important that all the EU institutions operate effectively and efficiently and the 370 million citizens of the European Union must support and have confidence in the Union 's internal legislative processes . #% That is not to say that there are no philosophical differences anymore , but it is to argue that these differences are being redefined by the objective conditions of the modern world we live in . #% Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the state-run tote . #% Reversing this situation and developing a smart , social market economy where the EU is a global leader across all fields of economic life will be the measure of this Commission . #% There will be more time for those later . #% Do you not think it strange that the countries that do not want to harmonise tax are the countries that have the highest growth rate , the lowest unemployment , the highest investment in infrastructure and the lowest personal tax ? #% We have heard about promoting the consumption of fish as a healthy food to support the fishing industry . #% We need a clear commitment today from your presidency that before the end of December you will have put the necessary proposal on the inclusion of a special chapter on the rights of children and adolescents in the Treaty to the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Another matter on which the Committee on Petitions has been lobbied intensely is the difficulties many teachers experience working in other Member States . #% Would the President agree with me that perhaps the additionality clause in the regulations needs to be looked at ? #% Wherever you find him or her , may God direct the hands , hearts and heads of the scientific , political and medical communities at this exciting but frightening and bewildering crossroads in time as we test the frontiers of knowledge . #% It is therefore crucial to ensure that measures are put in place to protect those suffering multiple discriminations . #% I will examine the matter further when I have received that report and I will ensure that the relevant Council minister receives a copy of the report . #% Our Government has made clear that it will support a yes vote for the Treaty of Nice , as of course democratically it is allowed to do , but my constituents would like to decide for themselves and would like to have copies of the Treaty itself . #% I , and my group , can not support doubling the EU budget in one area without a commitment to showing where that money can come from elsewhere . #% There can be no successful dialogue with criminal terrorism for it is a lie incarnate . #% I have to say at the outset that this is not necessarily a major problem for what we would term the ` major airlines ' , that is , airlines such as Lufthansa , Air France , British Airways and the other big boys . #% We need to look at local initiatives , education , training , the organization of working time , promotion of SMEs ; but above all we need to win the arguments for EMU in our regions . #% But much of the reason for high unemployment relates to other matters , not just World Trade Organization matters . #% The whole area must be managed by the stakeholders through the regional advisory councils , if not , we will never bridge the deep divide that exists between fishermen and scientists at the moment . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report . #% And this via media which we sought to bring forward - and as democrats we have to accept the win or loss - was blown out of the water by a procedure which disgusts me . #% As far as Parliament 's work is concerned , however , I am satisfied . #% The Vice-President , Mr Martin , enjoys the full confidence of the House and of the President to conduct our affairs this morning . #% It is essential , in relation to the threat that highways and the trans-European networks are having on mountain regions , that these protocols are properly implemented , not just in relation to the Alpine regions but also in other regions such as the Pyrenees which are in danger . #% Today , headlines , reports and editorials in a serious daily newspaper , the , stated that Mr Prodi believed that any state voting against the constitutional treaty now in its final stages of negotiation should logically leave the EU . #% In this report we are presented with proposals to remove the barriers and distortions in the European Union post-trading environment , to create a level playing field between institutions , a common regulatory view and the development of rights of access and choice . #% As has been noted , the title of this proposed directive , which will overhaul the existing mutual assistance directive , is slightly misleading , given that it will only , in effect , apply to direct taxation and insurance , indirect taxation in the form of VAT and excise duties being dealt with in separate instruments . #% This has all taken place in secret , behind closed doors . #% Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques , personnel and equipment at appropriate locations . #% There has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment . #% I also welcome the comments made by the Commission President , Mr Prodi . #% I think it is very good for your region . #% Simultaneously , the peace process can be reactivated on the basis of the so-called roadmap , which has been accepted by the two sides . #% When it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact on which EMU was founded , I trust that , under the revised and hopefully robust pact , the lack of even-handedness in chastising errant Member States will be a thing of the past . #% In relation to the coexistence issue , this is a myth . #% While I do not support the return to routine or preventive vaccination , a review of vaccination policy is very appropriate , especially the use of emergency or fire-break vaccination to control the spread of an outbreak . #% Mr President , I wish to join the others in thanking the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , for an excellent job well done . #% We are talking about the protection of our children , and that must be our overriding interest at all times . #% It will do more than all the talking and directives and transposition into national law . #% It was interesting that the Commission recorded that several countries had failed to meet targets in the statistics on the size and capacity of the national fleets . #% Of course , in the Commission communication consistency is a stated objective . #% This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens . #% That is what my fishermen and fishermen from the remote communities of the periphery of Europe want to hear from you . #% Most importantly , however , they will ensure that the minorities within Kosovo are also protected and represented and that they do not become part of a singular state in which they have no influence or role to play . #% Therefore it is all the more bizarre that the Council of Ministers and the Member States that compose it wish to repatriate money where it does not have that added value . #% 
Nevertheless if there is one objective we should set ourselves in this area , it is to use our economic trading strength and our economic resources for the betterment of the Third World . #% I believe the legislation now agreed and awaiting final sanction by our colleagues in this Parliament tomorrow strikes an equitable balance between environmental protection and single market concerns . #% I call for corrupt regimes or individuals to be blacklisted , to prevent them from borrowing large sums of money from wealthy countries . #% In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation , it was the clear intention of the legislators -- Parliament and the Council -- to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base . #% Madam President , I would appeal to you to write to all the parties in Northern Ireland , and the Irish and the British governments , to urge them to use every power and every means of persuasion at their disposal to stop these kinds of protests . #% So instead of reducing working time in this House we should devote a little more time to underlining the failures of the European Union to implement its decisions . #% It is the great drug barons whom we seem to tolerate . #% There is an obligation on each and every one of us to support that change . #% Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission , and he will therefore be calling the shots - excuse the pun - concerning troop activities on the ground . #% Likewise , the Serb minority in Kosovo has concerns that must be addressed . #% The first few weeks of the lives of newborn children are invaluable for the development of trust , sensory-cognitive skills and a bond with both their parents . #% Europe , in my view , must continue to invest in young people . #% In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures . #% I could go to America and back in the same time ! #% Any proposal that corporate tax be paid by SEs and could go into EU coffers is totally unacceptable . #% I can certainly recommend to the House that the application must take Maltese opinion fully into account . #% This is one of the problems with this compromise resolution , that it is too weak on this point . #% The aspirations set out in those Tasks were perhaps most rudely challenged by Kosovo where the gap between aspirations and reality was cruelly exposed by an absence of an appropriate operational substance . #% In landfill sites which are geared to non-toxic waste , there will be a loophole to allow toxic waste to be added , depending on what kind of justification is given . #% I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system . #% I , too , in the short period that I have want to welcome the Agreement and to say that I sincerely hope it will be supported by the vast majority of the people of Ireland , North and South . #% Until we find a way of encouraging all the Member States to do this , there is no point in one Member State doing it , there is no point in two or even three , four or five Member States : it has to be right across the board of all Member States or else you will end up with massive recriminations between Member States as to who is doing what . #% The human rights problems in Tibet , Belarus and so on are hard to comprehend . #% That is not how political persuasion operates . #% In this respect , it is totally unacceptable that the Council has proposed an across-the-board reduction in agricultural spending in comparison with that which the Commission has proposed . #% That being said , however , we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights . #% Reducing the levels of harmful active substances and in particular replacing the most dangerous by safer , non-chemical alternatives and encouraging pesticide-free crop farming are aims I very much welcome . #% His insult to our honoured police dead and to our honoured police maimed is something we will not tolerate . #% However , I would now like to ask the Commission again whether it will undertake to bring in measures complementary to this agreement in the first three months of next year . #% Everything must be anchored in the developing countries with an understanding that , should we find these things , should we find a better vaccine for tuberculosis , better drugs for HIV/AIDS and better diagnostic tests , they will be available to those that need them . #% PROGRESS will hopefully take the competition out of the allocation of funding and other resources to social partners representing people who , because of their situation in life -- physical , mental , social , ethnic , economic , employment or lack of employment , and so on -- need the support of the wider community . #% At the last plenary session I tabled a question to the Council , in time and in full accordance with the Rules , yet the Presidency refused to answer the question because they had not received all language translations . #% If France and Germany can seek changes to the Lisbon Treaty , it is vitally important that the UK Government use the renegotiation process to win back powers to our sovereign parliament . #% There must be no erosion of the workers ' rights that have been won over time . #% Proper monitoring of the implementation of the rules of the directive is now urgently required . #% Commissioner , I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and , even though you do not foresee extending the directive , I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers . #% The European Union must complement Irish legislation on this matter , especially as there will be one million mobile phones in Ireland by the end of 1998 . #% We are in fact going backwards after seven years of trying to meet climate change commitments : this is not only unacceptable , it is completely scandalous . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner what level of discussions he has had with Member States of the eurozone in relation to their performance and their potential performance . #% Proposals should not interfere with subsidiarity . #% Regarding the most recent stock assessment of octopus in Mauritania , the report says '' ... the assessment conducted in 1998 indicates that the stock was over-exploited ... '' and it then goes on to say that '' ... the 1998 working group in Nouadhibou recommended a reduction of 25 % of the fishing effort exerted by the cephalopod fisheries ... '' . #% We must get serious about this problem and also look at the countries that are claiming to have met their obligations under the MAGP , to ensure that they are not transferring their vessels to other flags . #% Mud lagoons dissolve the mercury , arsenic , cadmium , antimony and many other toxic minerals , and channel them via neighbouring streams straight into the Shannon River , only metres away from where the water supply for Limerick City is taken . #% Of course , we need to do that , but no matter how often or how well we do that , there will still be a need for people to move into the wealthier parts of Europe . #% The euro can be the icing on the cake of sound economic management , but no amount of propaganda or spin can ever sell it on its own . #% This is the toughest resolution that we have seen on Darfur , but it is action that is needed . #% I hope , Commissioner , you will encourage the cooperation that is required . #% In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Famagusta and since then the city has been fenced off . #% Let me immediately state that I support the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which call for the need to coordinate broad economic policies of the various participating Member States within the single European currency . #% The Chief Inspector recommended that the high-level waste tanks and the serious risk resulting from the inability of BNFL to make them passively safe through vitrification was an urgent issue . #% What is going to be the situation on the beef market ? #% I just wish to congratulate the Commissioner on his replies . #% Firstly , the ELDR Group in this House comes here in terms of a European vocation . #% Like many other countries -- Côte d’Ivoire , Uzbekistan and Chechnya , etc. -- East Timor has been exploited by bigger powers . #% Today , I have no doubt , the Commission and the presidency of the Union will be aware that Parliament no longer wants to fudge on the issue of Burundi . #% It is extremely important that action is taken to ensure that we reduce the amount of pollution-related diseases . #% I would ask people to remain committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals . #% We have no idea of the extent to which we are responsible for the 500 000 deaths resulting from the use , and indeed misuse , of small arms exports . #% The people want sensible cooperation and not dogmatic federalism . #% So save yourselves the trouble and admit that the Treaty is dead , with no prospect of resurrection . #% My own experience in Ireland is that the real needs of the many thousands of people , mainly women , who care for our 25 000 or so sufferers of Alzheimer 's disease , are neglected . #% If we do not have the vets on the ground , particularly in remote areas where it is not viable to have veterinary practices , we have no detection system for the future . #% It is regrettable but understandable that problems have increased in the areas of the structural funds , because we have reached an unprecedented level of spending and the regulations in the first place were difficult , as was drawn attention to last year . #% At least that has allowed us not to have to come back after 9 p.m. #% It is not too late to put together a restructuring package for the industry . #% My last point is that some people on both sides of this argument will try and present it as a clash of civilisations or religions or cultures . #% 
There are also some serious questions relating to planning because some of the afforestation is also unsightly . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for her reply and ask a question arising from it . #% To give you one example , the polio vaccine we use today is the fourth polio vaccine , because the other three , after having been given to people for many years , were finally withdrawn because of mounting evidence of damage . #% Mr President , one thing that has not been mentioned during this debate is the fisheries protocol which has been attached to this agreement . #% We have to take that into account . #% The Commission proposal is based on the principle of sustainable development and the poor state of fishery resources . #% Since Sir Leon has galloped through the answer at enormous speed , I will have to ask him if he would give me a copy of his answer . #% Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive , a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the aegis of agencies . #% Mr President , on the Péry report , I am most amazed . #% I absolutely reject the assertion that levelling up tax in the direction of harmonisation , can offer any solution to the un-competitiveness of Europe . #% Unlike the assertions from some speakers in this House today , this is not telling people what to do or how to think ; it is giving our citizens a choice . #% Coming from a maritime region of the Union , I am acutely aware of the preciousness of our marine resources and the need for sustainable activities , which assure these resources for future generations . #% I certainly hope that with the passing of the Europol Convention we will now see greater cooperation under the third pillar . #% We need a precautionary approach but not a preventive one . #% Their coverage shows quite clearly that we spoke out against the regime , that we insisted on full cooperation with the weapons inspectors and that we brought up past issues such as the gassing of the Kurds . #% Is it true that the dates suggested by Mr Nisticò and others would drastically reduce the availability of stem cell lines to make the European Union totally dependent on the United States , Israel and other countries for lines under patent ? #% There is little chance . #% I am quite sure that Archbishop Courtney 's family and many friends will appreciate the support of the European Parliament at this time . #% European political parties , that it is hoped might eclipse national parties , may fit the template of European integration , but the rock upon which they will perish is that of democratic rejection when they have to face the harsh reality of seeking a popular mandate from real people on real issues . #% This year gill netting has been banned in waters deeper than 200 metres . #% The application of global amounts in accordance with commercial practice has also been accepted as have , in a range of other areas , the inclusion of local flights , measures to be taken when aircraft land without adequate insurance cover , and withdrawal of operating licence if the insurance cover is not sufficient . #% In fairness , Mr Barroso has responded : he has made changes and has moved some way towards meeting some of those concerns . #% Mr President , I share the view of Saddam Hussein expressed in this House . #% Therefore any improvement in the position of individual farmers has come at the expense of employment in the sector . #% Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union , it is a relatively small amount of money . #% It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this . #% Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia , Malaysia , Thailand , South Africa ; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal . #% Most of that money was spent on market support in the form of export refunds and storage , which mainly created opportunities for immense schemes of fraud and deception . #% It has to add to the existing safety requirements of the IEA , therefore it is a nonsense . #% Given that the American authorities have conceded that it was a failure on the part of their security agencies rather than airport technology which led to the recent Detroit terrorist scare , I believe that , before we invest in this controversial technology , a variety of less expensive methods - such as increased intelligence , different search methods and enhanced international cooperation - should be explored . #% Given that the Commission is broadly in agreement with the Parliament 's proposals , I call on this House to make their voice heard in ensuring that the European Council also supports this report 's environmental proposals . #% This report makes it possible to apply the ` polluter pays ' principle , a principle which must be used with great consistency and efficiency . #% I reiterate , for my group , that we totally support this . #% Live animal exports are a hugely important , legitimate business for Ireland . #% They use cross-subsidy to the tune of 31.8 billion of public money - and rising fast - compared to our EUR 6 billion - and falling . #% I think the very least we could do is have a study carried out so that we would base our decision on facts as they affect the citizen of the Union . #% At the moment people are just learning what it is about , getting their programme off the ground , and now they are concerned that it might not continue after the end of 1999 . #% Europe 's motor and oil industries must be able to comply with clearly defined targets in any new legislation , to ensure that they can plan in confidence for the next generation of motor vehicles and invest in better refineries . #% He has set the problem out very well . #% The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies . #% I also welcome the expansion of the directive to include other sectors such as the chemical and aluminium sectors . #% That is how terrorist organisations think and work , as they fight their long , multi-faceted war . #% If the EU is to act as one in the future then the force must be an EU one with components from all Member States who wish to participate , and operating on the initiative and under the political control of the EU . #% I should also like to inform my colleague , Mr Stubb , that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate . #% A total of EUR 5 billion is out on loans at the moment . #% Except the US and Somalia , all countries in the world have ratified the Convention ; but despite the fact that the EU Member States have ratified it too , the EU institutions themselves have so far failed to implement it . #% I wish the authorities could do something about the fact that we still have a landfill site in Rogerstown estuary in north County Dublin , in an area which is a natural habitat for wild birds and so on . #% However , the Council and the Commission have responded to the concerns which Parliament raised and brought forward a new proposal and a new team , which we now have the responsibility to endorse . #% in writing . - I voted against the Costa report on airport slots , in order to highlight the complete lack of consultation with airport authorities , the lack of debate with MEPs and the rushed nature of the legislation . #% I am glad to say that the Irish presidency intends to make this a priority in its forthcoming term . #% We have to change the way we do our business . #% Confronting these problems will require a radical reform of Member States ' laws to protect our children more effectively . #% I support that generally and , in particular , I support the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to have an impact analysis on implicit and standard rates of VAT in the Member States , which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services . #% When we condemn this particular action we should remember that there are Loyalist and Republican thugs who are deliberately attempting to undermine an agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland , both north and south , and we will not let them do that . #% However , I and the rapporteur will need to go to other institutions , and we have to go fortified by the weight of this House . #% Openness , transparency and accountability are key building blocks to building a European demos . #% We need to maintain the CAP budget to ensure these vital environmental services are provided in Ireland and across Europe . #% I would like to see the Safeguards Office getting all the resources it needs to continue to do its job to the fullest extent possible , particularly with accession countries coming in . #% The proposal is essentially a humanitarian response to the need to offer protection on a temporary basis to individuals fleeing a country in significant numbers as their lives are in imminent danger . #% Under it the precious Constitution has been shipwrecked on the rocks of rejection and the budget is an unmitigated shambles , with rancour , as in Mr Juncker 's speech today , being its currency . #% I know how difficult this area has been in the past for the Council . #% The other point I want to make is that rail internally , both on the continent of Europe and in Ireland , is important as a public service . #% The Galileo technology is a very precise type of technology which will be used for military means . #% That resignation follows the damning report by the Committee of Independent Experts of the Commission as an administration that in too many instances was out of control and a system where too few people were prepared to accept personal accountability and responsibility for their conduct of public affairs . #% Sound economics , realism and results are what the citizens want , and our job is to deliver . #% I appeal for something to be done about it . #% 
I deeply regret that 430 Members of the House voted against this fundamental policy of the CAP , as I outlined earlier . #% What I want to know is whether or not that request has been acceded to before I proceed with what I might like to say . #% Our hearings helped to elicit further understanding of this matter . #% It is an abysmal record , compared to the United States and Japan . #% The environment is more important at this stage than a few hundred jobs . #% I think you will agree with me but if you do not you should say it here that Malta is well qualified economically and otherwise ahead of other applicant countries . #% When I came to Europe in 1989 , we did not have a food problem . #% Immediate concerted action at a European level is needed to reclaim our natural woodlands for the red squirrel before it is too late . #% Partnership is the key at all times and consultation between all interested parties is very important if the problem of social exclusion is to be solved sooner rather than later . #% This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation , but progress , I regret , is far too slow . #% We voted with our Spanish colleagues , so the onus is on the Council and not the Member States to meet any shortfall that arises . #% As fish stocks are decreasing in abundance faster than the fishing fleets chasing them , the future does not look bright for either the fish or the coastal communities and the people depending on the fishing industry for a living . #% Finally , Parliament has capitulated to the Commission and the Council in its refusal to uphold its already inadequate first reading position . #% We have enjoyed working with her over the last five years in the environmental portfolio . #% Likewise , the proposed quota of EUR 525 million in structural fund payment appropriations . #% The percentage of people outside the families who work in the industry is very small indeed . #% Transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil . #% We must defend those rights . #% It means corporations installing facilities like incinerators , because Ireland has been marked as being good for that . #% If such a delegation were to come from this House , would the presidency receive it affirmatively ? #% Would honesty not require us to label our produce as ` Monsanto Corporation , produced in St Louis , Missouri ' ? #% This we believe would create more legal uncertainty , more court cases , more money perhaps for lawyers , but that can not be in the interests of business or consumers . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a piece of very good work . #% Despite propaganda that these were terrorists , in the main , they were , in fact , impoverished farmers from the north and around Bangkok , sections of the urban working class , and their families , who saw their protest as a struggle against the enormous poverty and hardship that they suffer . #% The appropriate financial resources must be made available to facilitate this process . #% Finally , I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs . #% We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends . #% I welcome the statement of the Palestinian authority which has declared that it will take action against terrorism while Prime Minister Barak has informally given an understanding that he will try to limit the expansion of settlements . #% I think it is undoable , because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks . #% Europe was one quarter of the entire world . #% So it is a source of great joy tonight that we have beaten Spain . #% The Commission is right to propose making compliance with relevant food safety rules a must for receiving subsidies . #% But once again simplifying the work of Parliament and the Commission is to be welcomed and therefore we will not be opposing this report . #% However , the reality is that they are trying to prevent positive action being taken , and to prevent real debate taking place on issues of concern to the people of Europe . #% Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives . #% There is a moral and political responsibility which can not be swept under the carpet . #% There will be the Apprentice Boys ' March on 12 August in Derry . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and also to pay tribute to Commissioner Flynn for his involvement in this whole area . #% Instead , let us have the same kind of investment in renewable energy that we have seen in nuclear energy over the past 40 years . #% It would have been helpful if we had known your mind before we started , Commissioner , because we are speaking in a vacuum . #% In this case though , I was designated to speak on this very important issue for the Group and I seek to make that statement now . #% The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism . #% A target date of April 2003 has also been set for accession treaties to be signed in Athens under the presidency of the Greek Government . #% There is little point in the farmers in the United Kingdom diversifying into organic production only to be undermined by products from South America coming in at a lower cost . #% Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman . #% Again , I hope that , on the basis of sound scientific principle and with proper use of the precautionary principle , which is not a ` preventionary ' principle , we will be able to look after endangered species as we should . #% If we are serious about supervising landing and if Member States cooperate , then tonnage reduction could actually be on a voluntary basis with compensation . #% I believe we now have a reasonable decision from conciliation . #% Only 8 countries have stepped up to the mark in providing a more formal analysis or Statement of Assurance , and sadly Ireland is not one of them . #% This is our objective . #% I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion . #% Development aid , agriculture , transport and tax all have energy implications . #% We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling . #% Unfortunately , much of that aid is of very little use to developing countries unless we also make trade work for them . #% I welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the Council . #% We , the Commission and the Council should be partners in seeking to be effective , and not competitive and seeking to keep things secretively to ourselves . #% The legislative dialogue must be restarted . #% Finally , I would also remind the Commission that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime . #% Clearly the development of renewables is linked to environmental objectives as well as issues of employment , regional development and the promotion of local initiatives . #% The negotiations which brought about the internal market and the single European currency were difficult but were always based on the premise that stability of the European Union is paramount at all times . #% A related issue concerns the budgetary powers of this Parliament , where different suggestions have been tabled to increase and decrease the role of Parliament in this area . #% We all know , and it has been said already , that the Yemen has made great progress recently in democratization and in respect for basic human rights . #% It was a new technology which fired many hopes , some of which have been realized , most not . #% While I appreciate that this is a complex technical issue , there is more that could be done to police this particular abuse . #% Under the current patchwork of legislation , without sufficient information on the majority of existing chemicals , we are unsure of the quantity of chemicals used and the effect on our health and our environment . #% It is very important to engage local communities in groups , outside the institutional level of the current peace talks . #% 
I support closed boxes such as the recent Celtic Sea cod box , which , though difficult , has been supported by fishermen . #% Yes , people come to this committee with problems that we very often can not solve , but at least they have a port to call on and , where cases are inadmissible , we try to redirect . #% This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures . #% Colleagues might be interested to know that one of the laureates for the Aristion Prize , which is part of this programme , is the husband of an ex-Member of this Parliament . #% If the European Union is to further multilateral approaches to global challenges , its Member States must act coherently and consistently at the UN level , particularly in light of the forthcoming review conferences for the Millennium Development Goals and the Non-Proliferation Treaty , as well as the review of the Human Rights Council 's status and working methods . #% That can not be substantiated . #% I strongly believe that cofinancing is essential . #% It also underlines a greater need for widespread policing in Northern Ireland . #% If the Member States do not have a lenient policy in their countries they should change it and not force the rest of us to drag our standards down to theirs . #% Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments . #% I thought then that if I had stood there 30 years ago at the end of the Second World War -- the worst half century in the history of the world in which 50 million human beings were slaughtered -- and had said to myself ` do n't worry , it 's all over , they will all be united very soon ' , I would have been sent to a psychiatrist . #% Mr President , ' Die Politik ist keine exakte Wissenschaft ' . #% This is just such a case . #% The Black Sea strategy must be based on the uniqueness of the area . #% In Belgium and France , emergency repairs can only be done after an eight-day prior notification , which is a contradiction in itself . #% It must be asked where did Saddam Hussein get the weapons from before the Gulf War and where is he supposed to be getting them from now ? #% So what are the solutions to the problem ? #% The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today . #% I would like to see a more targeted approach being taken to curve the number of road users drivers , young drivers specifically , cyclists , and pedestrians dying , unnecessarily , on European roads . #% in writing . - It is clear that mercury is a substance that needs to be dealt with in a cautious and secure manner . #% Furthermore , the shortage of medical and food aid has made deaths from these treatable diseases epidemic . #% It is a recipe for feeding hatred , not for coming to terms with the awfulness of terrorism . #% The last point I want to make is that , arising from these pressures , we will have a reaction from agriculture . #% I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another . #% Mr President , I would like to say a word or two of appreciation and thanks to the President-in-Office for his valuable contribution to the European Parliament this afternoon and to take the opportunity of wishing him and his colleagues who are guiding the UK Presidency continued success for the remainder of their term . #% Mr President , Commissioner , colleagues , I believe today 's debate on both the EU 's urban agenda and the report on regional planning and European spatial development perspective raises two very important and yet related dimensions of European regional policy . #% I want to welcome the announcement by the Commissioner . #% The bureaucratic planning authorities which , with their dogmatic beliefs , are destroying and depopulating rural society , need to show more understanding . #% The agreement with Equatorial Guinea concerns tuna , but Equatorial Guinea is a well-known flag of convenience country . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Taoiseach , Mr Bertie Ahern , and his colleagues here today . #% Information technology has made extraordinary strides in recent years and the advent of the Internet has brought the benefits of IT into many homes and businesses in recent times . #% In terms of these regulations , a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic . #% It is a situation which the European Union has addressed from time to time , but there is serious concern amongst human rights defenders , both in Colombia and in Europe , that the European Union is allowing this issue to slide off the agenda . #% Total funding will amount to # 20 million and this will be allocated in two principal areas - the exchange of information and cooperation at Community level and the raising of public awareness . #% Parliament should take the opportunity presented by today 's debate to reaffirm its commitment to the political aim of reaching a wide-ranging and comprehensive agreement with South Africa which is fair to the interests of both parties . #% However , I want to deal with another issue . #% Whatever the cost of developing the economies of rural areas , it will cost a great deal more in the long-term if we do not provide for the balanced development of both town and countryside . #% I was fortunate that this was my experience in Sri Lanka . #% Through its actions today , the European Parliament , in sending once again a message of goodwill to Sri Lanka , is also expressing its wish for the President and the Prime Minister to work together in the national interest . #% The URBAN initiative is a small programme with a big impact . #% Firstly , Schengen is not a treaty-based agreement . #% We share common democratic values and interests and we stand together willing to fight against terrorism and promote those interests and values . #% If it is possible for Greenland , then it should also be possible for the ACP countries . #% Some courts have put a question mark about the operation of the European Arrest Warrant , whether as regards its transposition into international law by the mechanism used or as regards the way that certain courts have interpreted elements of the arrest warrant process . #% I also think that OLAF would be less frustrated when , after having proceeded and found situations serious enough to be passed on to Public Prosecutors at national level , it does not happen . #% All European countries should implement all the various directives as required . #% Madam President , I would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and thank him for the communication on the broad guidelines to economic policy . #% The financial services industry must certainly put its house in order and ensure ethical conduct and diligence to protect the jobs and savings of millions of people . #% While it is still on the first reading , there is a possibility of introducing amendments at the further stages . #% With the measures agreed in this package of legislation , they will be reduced by more than 20 % from the 1995 levels by 2012 . #% It advocated the removal of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy imposed upon European farmers which , in my opinion , has become over-burdensome and seriously impinges upon the time that they would rather spend actually farming . #% What Mrs McKenna said about Wicklow County Council is absolutely true . #% Mr President , I too want to sympathize with the relatives of the fisherman who was drowned off the south coast of Ireland in a collision which took place on Sunday . #% According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee , junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period . #% I once heard a former member of the Council of Ministers say that he put the question informally to all of the finance ministers who were seated around the table : ' What are NCAs ? ' . #% I have to say that the majority of these problems and restructuring come indeed from the strength of cost competition from developing countries . #% Lastly , I hope the reforms do what the Commissioner says they will do : give us a competitive sugar industry . #% It should be pointed out that the French Government had intended to bring a similar case but decided against doing so as it was clear that such a case had no chance of success . #% How long is that going to take to rectify ? #% I can not speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland , never mind the island of Ireland , because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world . #% Mr President , the implications of Agenda 2000 are of great importance to my country , Ireland . #% One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular . #% It is unacceptable for human life , whatever its age , to be treated as a commercial product , without regard to that life or the price paid by women in supplying the embryos . #% There must be no repeats of last Monday 's accident . #% While it might be very simple to operate , it is not linked directly to land area and does not suit the highly desirable objectives of the Commission to promote environmentally friendly grass-based systems of production - which the Commissioner has just mentioned . #% In particular , you are to be congratulated on the work and enthusiasm that you have put into the enlargement issue . #% 
Closer cross-border regulation , monitoring and minimum harmonised standards for agents ' contracts would contribute to tackling this problem and are necessary to ensure the integrity of football . #% The Council , the Council of Ministers , the presidency have to take into consideration that in Ireland the coastal regions have no alternative source of employment . #% It will be very difficult , if not impossible , to create a single currency without the support of the citizens of the participating countries . #% In this sense , the people of sub-Saharan Africa can take inspiration from their brothers and sisters in Tunisia in their heroic struggle against a corrupt dictatorship over the past weeks . #% We do not need more arms in this world - we need less . #% I wish her well during the presidency and hope that her relationship with the Members will be as open and blunt as it has been this afternoon . #% Cancellation of 80 % of Iraqi debt is certainly something to be welcomed . #% Restoring confidence in the food chain has been a slow , tedious and indeed expensive process . #% Even though the rights of children are not enshrined in the Treaty yet -- and we hope this will come eventually -- we now have several pieces of excellent legislation that should ensure the safety and rights of these children to know both their parents in the event of a marital breakdown . #% Indeed , in Ireland , we can hang our heads in shame . #% From an Irish perspective , any future EU Treaty that appears to supersede the Irish Constitution will be extremely difficult - if not impossible - to sell to the Irish people . #% The rapporteur , like many of us , endorses the Commission 's recommendations and the action plan it has put forward . #% I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that , and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament , we too seized the moment . #% Commissioner , I know you are doing your very best in a very difficult position , but your remarks about the British Government decision yesterday are far too charitable . #% And the same applies elsewhere , particularly in the United Kingdom . #% You have been an impressive defender and promoter of the Charter on Fundamental Rights and we salute you for that . #% I welcome Parliament 's decision not to consider the Commission 's proposal to cut aid to cereal farmers . #% Their livelihood has , up until now , depended on the historic claim his local community held on its coast 's fishing rights . #% Without a clear and mutually accepted definition of terrorism , states must be able to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to deal with these serious threats . #% - I wish to place on record my serious concern at the decision of the EP to seek the deletion of the Irish ( including Northern Ireland and Greece ) derogation from the full effects of this directive . #% For that reason it is important that the IGC does not take any step backwards . #% I turn to the report by Mr Purvis . #% Firstly , I would like to focus on Timothy 's report on the draft Council Decision adopting the rules on the confidentiality of Europol information . #% We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems . #% Mr President , the common fisheries policy , as many have pointed out , has failed to conserve fish stocks at adequate levels to support a viable industry . #% Up to 125 000 jobs are supported in the EU 15 in nature protection related activities . #% In respect of the García Arias report on competition policy , I wish to put down a very clear political marker that whereas the Liberal Group is prepared to support this report in general , there is one specific blockage and condition in respect of our support and that relates to paragraph 15 and the call for the amendment in the IGC of Article 90 ( 2 ) . #% It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing . #% However , it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve . #% I hope there will be a follow-up to the Science White Paper . #% As it is Christmas , I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his handling of Question Time and his wit . #% So how can we be sure of the current capacity of the Latvian fleet and that these transfers will not lead to an increase and more overfishing ? #% There is also the whole question of neutrality which has not been touched on . #% In the UK , members of the so-called `` Wonderland Club '' , an Internet paedophilia ring , were arrested and found to have sites in 12 different European countries . #% The rapporteur stresses the equal value - and I agree with him - of cohesion policy alongside achieving the single European market and economic and monetary union . #% It is also a disaster for the young men and women forced to join and fight there in the armies of NATO and the United States , of whom perhaps 500 have already been killed this year . #% Only towards the end of last year did the Commission negotiators come up with a compromise proposal . #% Finally , as a result of the Court of Auditors ' decisions , we must ensure that our accounting and delivery practices are better , to ensure that all students can benefit not only from a tremendous academic achievement but also from a cultural experience . #% However , there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments . #% The part that European farmers can play in this will come into clearer focus in the ongoing debate on the future shape of the CAP post-2013 and it is essential that the EU assists our farmers in striking this balance . #% We should recall for a moment that the key findings of this fact-finding committee include the following recommendations : the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority should reaffirm existing agreements and immediately cease violence ; there should be a resumption of security cooperation ; there should be establishment of a meaningful cooling-off period and incitement in all forms should be discouraged . #% We will be looking for a roll-call vote on this aspect of the report tomorrow . #% It is simply not acceptable , Mr Commissioner . #% Each of the European institutions must take on its responsibility to get the message across to our WTO partners regarding the EU offer which remains on the table . #% Last week the International Court of Justice found , much to the vindication of Ireland 's position , that nuclear weapons were the ultimate evil . #% By no means do we want to tell fishermen that we are offering them anything like a renationalisation or that we are removing the common fisheries policy . #% To Mr Ahern I say : now it is time to come home . #% I support this resolution . #% The areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection , healthcare , taxation and recognition of academic qualifications , particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States , such as in border regions . #% However , I would like it noted that we do not agree in full with the wording of paragraph 125 of the report . #% We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol . #% A strong call should go from this Parliament tomorrow that the Conventions need to be reviewed and that we need to get serious about how we are handling the drug issue . #% This should be specified . #% That defeats additionality and cheats a region like mine out of funds intended by Europe to provide true additional expenditure there . #% In committee I also queried whether a culture of corruption had spread to the independent quality assurance verification by Lloyd 's Quality Assurance who verify that BNF procedures comply with health and safety requirements . #% That would offend and it would defy the settled political will of Northern Ireland 's people . #% I believe that this report clearly stipulates that this regulation can in no way constitute a legal basis to watering down existing safety protection in Member States . #% Mr President , I am not naive enough to think that this incident is unique , and recognise that it is common practice for intelligence agencies worldwide to gather information for their governments . #% This had a dramatic impact on improving the available workforce to the growing industrial base and services base in Ireland . #% In some of the opinions annexed to the report there are entirely different descriptions of the industry at European level than the one he gives . #% I also welcome compromises around the issue of audit partner rotation and the issue of non-audit work . #% The EU must act within the constraints and parameters of that reality . #% On this historic occasion I want to say that I hope all Member States will join the single currency before too long . #% I understand that the Irish Government has recently responded to a letter from the Commission requesting clarification on the role and financing of public service broadcasting in Ireland . #% We have worked hard to get legal certainty and there is a clear process for updating and supplementing prospectuses . #% To some extent , they are still on automatic . #% 
It is clear that , in many Member States , homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States . #% How can you encourage young people onto the land ? #% As Mrs Isler Béguin said , can we see the same level of subsidies - look at the money spent on research in fusion - in renewable energies ? #% These unilateral quotas contributed to the obliteration of some of the stocks in eastern Canada ; I say ` contributed to ' for the responsibility does not actually lie with the EU alone . #% Irish representatives , Finnish representatives , German representatives , Austrian representatives , French representatives must speak to people to tell them what is required . #% I would ask you to urge the Commission to come forward as a matter of urgency with those proposals because they need to be brought forward before the end of this year . #% Mr President , ` one size fits all ' is one of the curses of EU legislation and , if the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety gets its way , we will have under this directive another classic illustration of it in action . #% The situation in Ireland is quite contrary to this principle . #% Interestingly , scientists have now established that obese children and young people do not actually consume more junk food than children of healthy body weight , but their lifestyle contains a serious deficit of physical activity . #% I agree with her : there is nothing more important that we could devote time to discussing in this Parliament . #% Technical fixes are not enough . #% Today not only Irish but also Portuguese waters are under attack . #% We witnessed an act of war - without a declaration of war - by persons , movements or states , as yet , not fully determined , but who acted with a grim and focused determination . #% While this is well-intentioned , we can not support this approach because it could be interpreted , taken in a vague sense , to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place . #% It adds further insult to injury when one is accused of forgetting the US contribution to two world wars . #% It is as evident in my country of Ireland as in any other EU Member State . #% In 2005 , the National Crime Council found that one in seven women in Ireland have experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical , sexual or emotional nature from their partner . #% I should like to congratulate the police service of Northern Ireland on overcoming an IRA-orchestrated and ongoing campaign of intimidation to begin the process of securing justice in this notorious case . #% However , Turkey too has serious obligations . #% The CAP produces measurable results and a clear return on investment with regard to the delivery of public goods . #% I would urge Commissioner Byrne to prioritise introduction of that level of consistency which is the only way that we can convince our consumers that we have a common policy in relation to ensuring public health . #% In current circumstances this court is needed more than ever . #% There is a new and different way forward that can succeed and operate for the betterment of the governments and the European Union as a whole , but most importantly for the betterment of the people . #% Mr President , I invite you to ask the presidency to contact the Member who made the allegations and who has been quoted - Mrs Patricia McKenna , of the Green Group - and to ask her to substantiate these allegations or have the decency to withdraw them . #% I urge all fans attending the World Cup to be alert to this scandal and to report any suspicions of trafficking that they might have . #% Therein lies the opportunity and the danger : the opportunity to engage citizens from all of the 25 countries in the European project , but equally the danger of failing to achieve that objective . #% Health promotion campaigns on nutrition and diet and the ability to initiate research into food allergy and food-borne disease could also come within its remit . #% I appreciate the difficulties that remain regarding the issues of refugees and settlements but I do call on leaders from both sides to stand firm in their support of the Roadmap . #% I would like to ask if the President-in-Office could give us an undertaking that wider consultation will take place in the future ? #% It allows us to be much more efficient in carrying out our EU objectives and policies on climate change , agriculture , security and development in the developing countries . #% Our Constitution is a finely crafted document , which enshrines the values and beliefs that have sustained the people of Ireland through the best and worst of times . #% So please could you let us have your assessment of the pros and cons to which you have referred . #% The fisheries agreement with Argentina subsidizes transfers to the Argentine flag . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner , following on from his own response just now , with regard to access to buildings and discussions between the European Union authorities and the Belgian authorities , what plans , if any , he has in his role to consult with the disabled people themselves to ask them what access and what kind of special facilities they may need . #% We have in the European Union a common market in beef and in other products . #% This year , it has announced that it will not reach that figure , not because we do not have the money , but because the Government wants to spend the money on winning the next election ! #% Finally , a word to the College of Commissioners in general . #% I have to say that my comments are not addressed to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies , because we know of her commitment to cohesion policy , but to the whole College of Commissioners . #% Like others I have some doubts about the wisdom in the Euratom part of the Fifth Framework Programme of spending hundreds and hundreds of millions of ECUs on research into nuclear fusion which will not generate electricity in the lifetime of anyone in this Chamber tonight . #% Though the IRA and Sinn Féin claim to have expelled or suspended up to ten members linked to this murder , their duplicity and double-dealing is amply illustrated by the fact that , three months after this murder , this cut-throat psychopath remained publicly proclaimed as one of Sinn Féin 's official treasurers . #% In that context , I continue to call on my own government in Ireland to at least make an offer of troops , even if the numbers are small , because I believe they have a positive role to play . #% It is essential that there should be a strong focus on young generations in the CAP post 2013 so to provide for the development of agriculture in an innovative and efficient way . #% Mr President , Mr President-in-Office and Mr President , I am very pleased that the Taoiseach and his ministers are here today and that they hold the presidency of Europe at this particularly crucial time . #% There is , incidentally , a very strong gender implication to the provision of energy , because of the tasks of women throughout the developing world . #% I note what has been said about EPSO and I would urge that greater efforts be made to remove the difficulties which exist there . #% I am satisfied that our negotiators understand the extent of this challenge and - I hope - draw on the benefit of hindsight resulting from our experiences with the current regime . #% Therefore , while I welcome what the Commissioner has said , I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be . #% Being Irish I have long known -- but perhaps others have not -- of your opposition to the so-called European social model . #% Mr President , in many EU countries - including my own - a lot of work still needs to be done to restore full confidence in the blood transfusion and blood products services generally after a period of tragic lapses in safety . #% We are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference . #% I welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in Europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover . #% Madam President , in the run-up to this debate we have seen left-wing and Liberal hysteria reach a crescendo . #% It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way with the Madrid conference , which enshrined the land for peace principle . #% One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the inevitable arrival and recurrence of a flu pandemic has thrust the issue of vaccination to the forefront of the news agenda . #% I welcome this report on the need to upgrade the railway systems within the European Union , as well as guaranteeing the most efficient use of railway infrastructure to meet consumer needs . #% Mr President , this question of sustainability is indeed of great interest and the priority of the Swedish Presidency is welcome . #% Animals can be , and are being , transported with full respect for their welfare . #% This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today . #% I nevertheless welcome the increase on the common position of EUR 300 million . #% Ratification by sixty Member States is required to achieve this and of the seven that have done so I regret to say that only one is from the EU , namely Italy . #% in writing . - The current RoHS restricts the use of six hazardous materials that were once contained in certain electrical and electronic equipment . #% I would love to see this debate taken side by side with the debate tomorrow on national allocation plans in relation to our Kyoto targets . #% I congratulate him on a very balanced and informative report , notwithstanding the slightly odd decision to link these two topics -- hedge funds and derivatives -- in a single report , as trade in derivatives is already far more regulated in the EU than the area of hedge funds . #% It was once known as the bread basket of Africa , and was once able to feed itself and many neighbouring countries . #% You can not continue to shut them out and blame them for non-cooperation . #% 
There were at least 70 people in the Chamber . #% So some progress has been made in that regard . #% But it is not just an issue of closed borders . #% We are told that Israel will use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances . #% I put it to the Commissioners that one of the things they can do from a practical point of view , to generate pressure on national governments to act , would be to ensure that these guidelines are sent to each individual member of each national parliament in the European Union , rather than going to the secretariats of the national parliaments . #% I will conclude by inviting the Commission to submit a proposal for the continuation of the EPRD to Parliament and the Council as quickly as possible for our consideration in good time before the end of the present programme . #% Mr President , I too should like to welcome the McCartney family members to the Chamber . #% The establishment , at the beginning of the current term , of a permanent European Parliament delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament is a very positive step which will contribute to consolidate the increasingly political engagement of the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly . #% Action has been taken in the past against one government -- the Irish Government -- because of its so-called failure to meet certain criteria under the broad economic policy guidelines . #% I believe the rapporteur is correct to criticise certain Member States for failing to supply adequate data . #% This historic event will herald an end to the artificial divide that existed in Europe since the end of World War II . #% If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries , they will get their supplies from far further afield , with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport . #% Also why not ask the passengers rather than assuming that their needs will be known ? #% Although transposition rates are improving , as shown in the internal market scoreboards , there is still room for much improvement . #% Here I also want to commend the work of the dedicated men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who helped train the local police force . #% Mr President , I would like to say at the outset that I am fully against flights of rendition . #% What is the point in having the clause if we do not act on it ? #% Are we going to start introducing Schengen agreements for bees , birds and the wind and also ensure that we do not have any kind of cross-pollination ? #% The gender pay gap - 17.4 % - has barely narrowed since 2000 . #% Despite the fact that it holds itself up as the moral police force of the world , it is murdering people every year - and thinks that is right . #% They had seen some evidence of a greater effort by the police force in Northern Ireland to be impartial and helpful to all the citizens . #% Mr President , I thank Mr Fruteau , not only for his work to date , but also for sticking with this marathon session ; and I also thank the Commission . #% Despite this , would you , Commissioner , accept the need for the European Parliament to give an opinion on the two directives and communication which you are presenting to us , particularly on whether or not the case for deep-level storage of highly radioactive waste has been proved ? #% I fully agree with this political sentiment . #% It is not in our constitution nor our statute law . #% Having a loving invested mother is the ideal for a child , which we should make every effort to accommodate where a woman wants to be available to her child in those early years . #% Even the tidiest house needs a spring-clean . #% The ethnic rivalry between the Hausa and the Berom people must also be recognised as a factor in the violence . #% As colleagues may know , the peace talks have been suspended since April . #% The answer to difference is to respect it , because it is an accident of birth . #% The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services , capital , goods and persons . #% We are all human and we belong to human institutions . #% I accept what you have said , but I would ask you to analyse more deeply the views of those who know . #% The present rules are cumbersome and have led to duplication and high administrative costs . #% The rejection of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people is not a rejection of enlargement . #% Labour Euro MPs opposed the rapporteur 's amendments to weaken the committee report , including a lower requirement for representation of women , a slower timetable for action on pay reform and less information on staff pay . #% The job is generally associated with low wages and unreliability . #% It is very difficult to get attention , which is quite frustrating . #% Sadly , there are many parts of the world today that are not self-sufficient , and we who have developed the techniques must share our technologies and our experiences with developing countries . #% It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there . #% That stipulation continues to be breached on a daily basis , but we still pump in aid as if all was well . #% This is a very worrying aspect . #% We should also remember that some Member States , including my country , must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC . #% The fees issue was also hotly contested . #% I do not support the militarisation of Europe . #% Those differences are not of a personal nature , but in what we see as the best vision for the future . #% Is it any wonder that people turn off Brussels or Strasbourg ? #% Secondly , the whole area of innovation , and about looking to see where jobs are going to come from in the future and making sure people have the skills and the training for that . #% A food can not be called organic if it is genetically modified . #% Thanks to the European Union , Europe 's past has been put aside in the interests of peace and prosperity for all the peoples of Europe . #% Mr President , I should like to comment on the Commission recommendation concerning staging posts when live animals are being transported from one Member State to another within the Union . #% Mr President , when the lights went out in California , in Turin and even in my own home town of Wexford -- not to mention the recent Gazprom incident -- there was a sudden concentration of minds on the security of energy supply , which is of critical importance to us both strategically and economically , particularly with energy import dependency and costs growing exponentially . #% That is the challenge for the future ; that is the challenge that we , as democrats , have to take on board . #% In conclusion , the four-year consumer protection programme for 1999-2003 is worth over # 91m and if requests are made for further increases in this budget , I am confident that Parliament would support such recommendations in the future . #% It is difficult to keep a focus and priority on the need for generosity and rapid relief , as we almost become conditioned to natural disaster after natural disaster . #% I believe that tax competition harmonises opportunities within the EU and it enables small countries on the periphery of the Union to compete . #% There was huge psychological damage , in particular to farmers and their families when they had to depopulate or destroy their animals . #% It is essential that we in Parliament and the Commission , keep our minds , and our ears and our eyes open , for new ways of tackling the unemployment problem . #% The European Parliament has always made clear that it wants the European Union to be serious about the issue of nuclear disarmament and this particular initiative is one further step on the path to global nuclear disarmament . #% I would like to support very much what the last speaker has just said . #% It can not be left to Member States , since there is a legal problem , I understand . #% I will highlight just three issues . #% This could be a significant advance given that at present several members of the outgoing Commission are responsible for different areas , which range from the legal aspects of migration , humanitarian aid and the free movement of persons to the foreign policy aspects of migration . #% The adoption of a directive on accident and investigation in November 1994 was the first EU response to the use of these new powers . #% There is a need to allow for flexibility within those models , to guarantee that the core values of putting the human being at the very centre of what the social model is about remain paramount . #% Resources are obviously required . #% 
Even Mr Lamy would have to admit that it is difficult to have a more liberalised trade than that ! #% Surely imposing a European directive and a Europe-wide legislation will seriously impact on these areas , as Members have already admitted there is a cost factor built into this : costs that will be passed on directly to the consumer and costs that will affect our industrial capacity as well as affecting our competitive edge . #% They need to be brought under the correct protection of the directive and I fully support Amendment No 5 calling for a maximum transition period of five years . #% Mr President , it is with the utmost pleasure , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group , that I say a very sincere word of thanks to you for the very able leadership which you have given Parliament over the last two-and-a-half years . #% It would be to the detriment of smaller states , to the detriment of smaller parties and peripheral regions . #% So , I would suggest to the Commission and Council that Parliament is offering them an opportunity to improve the balance of the package before them , and I would urge them to accept the proposals being put forward by Parliament . #% It will be up to the Irish parliament to decide what defence missions our forces become engaged in . #% The Irish Constitution does indeed ban abortion , but it provides for exceptions . #% There has been no change in the agreement . #% Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little , too late . #% Mr President , a few weeks ago in Parliament we voted on the Maat report on the welfare of animals during transport . #% The fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear indication that we can all agree on this text . #% I had expected my colleague , Mr Florenz , to be leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but I do not see him . #% I am very short but would appreciate it if you would look over here occasionally ! #% The goal of admitting new members into the European Union by 2004 is still a very ambitious one , but it is not a pipe dream . #% We must be fully aware of the consequences of what is proposed . #% One proposal which I oppose - and we have asked for a separate vote - is on the question of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office . #% These regions have permanent handicaps and we need to recognise this . #% That is not unrelated to the issue that we are currently discussing in connection with the World Social Forum . #% We ask for fair play in return for that support . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and in so doing acknowledge the positive role of Parliament in setting the agenda for the highest standards of environmental protection . #% Yet we have no evidence , as has been constantly repeated in this House this morning , that Iraq has weapons of the kind referred to by the hawks in the American Government . #% It has come as a horrible shock to learn of the decision to prevent people from standing for election . #% In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists . #% I say to the Commission that the CFP must be geared towards keeping alive regions which depend on fishing rather than making it a battlefield between Member States . #% I urge you , Mr President , to ensure in future that where a Member has to present a report they are able to do so in their own language even if this means taking interpreting staff from another committee for the period concerned . #% So you are saying you would keep the Irish people in the dark and bully them into voting ` yes ' . #% Could the Commission also comment on the lack of effectiveness of the present inspectorate in this regard ? #% Producers , traders and the entire agri-food business have felt the effect . #% Whereas I understand that one million jobs are expected to be created over the next 12 months , the unemployment rate would still remain stubbornly high , at about 8.4 % . #% Even for the centre right it makes sense . #% The response has been positive , as the Commissioner knows from his contacts throughout Europe , including a recent visit to Cambridge . #% Madam President , I would be very obliged if you would read the name of the card I was accused of voting for twice and have the services check if votes were cast on that card . #% These Member States , which are collaborating , were let off the hook totally . #% If we fail to resolve this issue before enlargement we will have abandoned the goal of a United States of Europe and replaced it with a glorified large free trade area with additional rules and regulations . #% I am quite sure that we can find at least 30 minutes to enable the Commissioner to do that , and to demonstrate that this is a credible political forum for the people of Europe . #% In most countries with abortion , and in those countries with euthanasia , people can now be exterminated simply because they are disabled . #% The amount allocated falls somewhat short of initial expectations . #% Let us lower and enforce speed limits . #% The current critical situation of many stocks makes it more urgent now than ever , not merely to roll out the 6 to 12 mile access regime which is totally inadequate , but rather to roll out the exclusive zone to 24 miles if we are serious about conserving stocks . #% It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment , an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture . #% We all accept that Mr Cashman 's excellent report is still and I do not mean to denigrate it - an aspirational report . #% For example , in Ireland 80 % of our packaging is imported . #% Either there is something wrong with the foods in question , in which case they should be banned , or they are safe , in which case no special rules are required . #% I do not think we can , because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers . #% As politicians we have a duty to inform ourselves before being dogmatic and proscriptive on matters of medical and scientific research , albeit with the regulatory tool of the precautionary principle for areas of scientific uncertainty available to us . #% Irish investment in wind energy will only pay off , for example , if there is European infrastructure to export that energy via the UK and France . #% I understand that the International Fund for Ireland has produced a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors ' report , which can be made available to Members . #% If we have to , let us set standards somewhere down the road longer-term . #% Ingredients in cosmetic products are now to be listed in full , including the ingredients of perfumes information which so far has not been available . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Szájer , for his efforts and for his report . #% So we recognised that there were benefits to be gained from the single market in the European Union other than just the amount of money that people got from the budget . #% As you and the Commissioner have said , they worked in a particularly sensitive political and security environment at great personal risk to themselves . #% The long-term objectives of the European Union should be served as best we can by the budget . #% The Lisbon Council asked the Commission to look at the possible need for an acceleration . #% Mr President , my comments relate to the remarks made earlier on fair trade . #% We should all recall that the primary motive of organised crime is financial gain . #% My second general point concerns the voting rules . #% Priorities must be in the best interests of our constituents and aimed at making their lives easier . #% The advent of enlargement , however , gives us a fresh opportunity to re-examine this matter . #% The euro has had a successful birth and is established as a world currency but it is still an infant . #% Mr President , I am pleased to announce that in the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy this evening the last piece of the jigsaw , Mr Clegg 's package , was voted through unanimously . #% We deal with many , many problems from across Member States but , as the statistics show , some countries use the services of the committee more widely than others , perhaps because there are members of the committee who are from those countries and therefore they attract problems from their constituents . #% There have been a number of instances where the independence of the rule of law and the observance of human rights have been called into question . #% - The political benefit to mankind of genetic research is seriously eroded by vested interests , using the technology in a manner which is not compatible with sustainable development , and every often in conflict with acceptable ethical standards . #% This is what causes violence and conflict . #% 
Again , this was unfair to the taxpayers and constituted bad administration . #% As an Irish Member I must refer to the Sellafield plant in the UK . #% The three factors I would attribute this success to are : firstly , the sound consensual politics pursued by governments over recent year , but particularly since 1993 ; secondly , the creation of the single market , which Irish exporters and industry have been able to exploit and , thirdly , the operation of the structural funds since the late 1980s . #% We must act as the guarantor of those rights . #% I believe that ` education , education , education ' is the real answer to poverty . #% On this count I welcome the maintenance of a clear separation between the two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications : the sectoral regime covering seven regulated professions and a general regime . #% What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector , and what is the Commission 's strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues , to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well-performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector ? #% Indeed , we would like to see Commissioner Wulf-Mathies there backing these projects and launching them . #% My second area of concern is the lack of real democratic control over what is negotiated on our behalf by the Commission . #% Yet , the Irish Department of Agriculture is at this very moment debarring applicants from the EU 's early retirement scheme for farmers if they are found to have been engaged in part-time work for a period prior to their application . #% To comply with this directive we must ship packaging waste overseas or build more reprocessing facilities and export the empty packaging , which is uneconomic . #% I fail to see why Ireland 's transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully , more diplomatically , with more understanding - both by you , Commissioner , and indeed by our somewhat maverick , though genial , finance minister . #% In addition , Mrs Wallis has asked us to look at a technical legal issue related to the ` cross-border ' definition . #% Western governments should be asked why they do not demand that the oil-well be used to transform the lives of the people , instead of propping up this regime . #% In more recent years , production and sale of these products have become more structured and commercialised . #% We stand on the threshold of realizing a shared strategic political goal in the form of launching EMU . #% The second point I want to make is in relation to the financial contribution report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna . #% We are all aware in this House that a constitutional referendum on the Treaty of Nice is being held in Ireland next week . #% I appeal , therefore , for some common sense in this debate . #% The time is clearly right to bring forward these directives , stability requirements and technical updates for these ships . #% Very recently the authorities have brought in new legislation for separate single-sex hospitals . #% The vast majority of European citizens do not want their money used to subsidise the inhumane transport of animals , which causes untold and unnecessary suffering . #% Twenty percent of Europe ' s children live in poverty despite the countries of the EU being amongst the richest in the world . '' #% This certainly applies to my country as well as France and I think to Germany and every other country . #% Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead , as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies ? #% There is a need for more extensive research on the causes of breast cancer , in particular on the effects of hazardous chemicals and the environmental pollution , nutrition , lifestyle and genetic factors . #% But the situation is shameful . #% The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency . #% Nevertheless , for the moment it must remain . #% Finally , we should put disputes in perspective , as the Commissioner has sought to do . #% Unfortunately , society has discriminated against women for centuries and the only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place some sort of structure that ensures that women actually get into decision-making and into the workforce . #% Whether this Parliament likes it or not , when laws are violated there is always a sad reaping to the violation of law . #% We argue about amendments that the European public will not understand . #% All political parties , the social partners and other interested parties will be represented on this forum , which is expected to begin its work very shortly . #% Madam President , I fear that I must say something that might upset some Members , but the ushers outside are afraid - and I use the word advisedly - to ask some Members to stop smoking , because of the kind of abuse they get when they try to do that . #% The consequences of the disaster are still being felt in Spain , Portugal and France . #% Secondly , we call for the application of a principle of positive discrimination in favour of the less-favoured regions under the new RDT framework programmes . #% Technically the identification of a specific day is not connected with health and safety at work . #% I presume this means he will reply in the normal way and within the normal period . #% What steps has the Commissioner taken to freeze the assets of Mr Mobutu which are held in Member States ? #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , can I take the opportunity of welcoming you , Commissioner , to your new post , and may you have a very successful term . #% We all know that the overwhelming majority of both petty and organised crime is drug-related . #% In this extremely serious and challenging context , what does the EU consider to be a priority ? #% Mary Robinson , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against the sanctions imposed in violation of international law , which prohibits the starving of civilians as a method of warfare . #% I welcome international cooperation , but we still have an awful lot of work to do . #% First , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response . #% It is essential therefore that the EU have a strict arms code policy that equates with EU values if we are to offer global leadership on this issue . #% I welcome the implementation of the SAPARD programme to help further rural development and community development within Hungary . #% Will the Members have that direct access to the committee to give an opinion on any specific issue , not through the Commission ? #% I know that in Ireland , my own country , the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future . #% The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme . #% Helmut Kohl said he believed that at the end of the line to European Union lay a European army and European police force . #% Finally , I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that , as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait , I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet . #% That of course is not the fault of the rapporteur . #% It is a travesty for these people to describe the one great peace movement of Europe , which is the European integration process , as heading towards militarisation . #% I also support , of course , the IDABC Programme as outlined by Mrs Read . #% I do hope that this Parliament , which has that responsibility , will undertake that in the course of the next 12 months . #% In relation to our joint motion for a resolution , I believe that those MEPs that have just returned from Guantánamo should be given an opportunity to contribute to that motion and improve its accuracy , effectiveness and credibility . #% That return is not just about esoteric ideals , but about creating real solutions to the problems that people face in their lives . #% The European Union has a responsibility here , and the Member States that are cooperating with the United States on military matters have an obligation to ensure that international treaties are respected . #% So , Commissioner , I want to thank you for the constructive and intensive work that you have carried out . #% In Ireland , 91 % of submissions were actually against the fluoridation of water . #% I compliment the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% Ever since the Agenda 2000 proposals for reform of the Union policies were first published in March 1998 it was always felt in some quarters that it would be difficult to find an agreement that was balanced and even-handed across all the territories of the European Union . #% Any charter of rights , any constitution will tell you , that all people are borne equal , yet every single day disabled people in the European Union are treated as unequal . #% These people would be at the height of their sports careers if they were not ill or had they not died . #% 
They are less transparent and less democratic and often lead to temporary misunderstandings , especially when negotiations are conducted - as they inevitably are - in only one language . #% I have been sitting here for almost half an hour waiting for my name to be called because I was informed by the services that I had to be present in order for my explanation of vote to be taken as written . #% I might also inform the House that we are awaiting the Commission detailed proposal on the TENs issue which the honourable Member has addressed . #% Question Time is this Parliament 's one opportunity to put the Commission in the dock and put questions on issues that affect our constituents . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I welcome Ms Fraga Estévez 's report , and particularly her highlighting of concerns on this proposal from the Commission , as I have serious reservations about the Commissioner 's proposals to adopt a maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) model as the reference point for managing fish stocks . #% It would simply be too much to ask small companies in Europe to deal with two different currencies for what was originally planned as a six-month period for the changeover . #% Following President Klaus 's signature and therefore the Treaty of Lisbon becoming a reality , the negotiations with the Council and Commission have become obsolete . #% If we want our farmers to continue producing and ensure food security for Europe , we can not , by regulation and withdrawal of support , literally force them out of business . #% Mr President , recent CAP reform will result in some fundamental changes , particularly at farm level . #% You should know that from Northern Ireland . #% It gives us that legal base for a set period although I have the same reservations as Mr Linkohr about the lack of a uniform legal base . #% However , one line jumped out at me , and that is that TACs can not control fishing mortality because they control landings but not catches and discards . #% I would say to my eloquent friend , Sir Robert Atkins , that , whilst he described me and the rapporteur as roses , we intend rather to be thorns in the side of the system , because there is something rotten here . #% Tomorrow , when we vote on the college , the ELDR group will vote for a college and we will not seek at this point to differentiate , to pick or to choose between nominees . #% We should wait to hear what the discussions will be and ensure that we focus our work on real and important issues for European citizens , not pie-in-the-sky attitudes . #% If colleagues think back to the early 1990s , when we had the whole Delors Plan with the white paper on the social package and so on , this was considered groundbreaking and innovative . #% This is just one more example of the way that the Irish government is behaving in relation to its obligations under EU directives . #% We want joined-up thinking , and we expect confirmation from the Commission that those measures , as important as these directives , will be part of the programme in the immediate future . #% That would be a drastic approach . #% in writing . - Yet again we have an ideologically driven proposal , this time on postal services . #% Minimising risks can best be achieved by improving controls on the distribution and use of pesticides , as well as substituting the more dangerous substances with safer alternatives . #% With this practical caveat , I give my full support to the proposal . #% The fundamental problem when we give mixed messages or perhaps poorly expressed or ill-judged messages is that we risk conveying the wrong message . #% For these conventions to be effective the implementation of the procedures must be extremely rapid and almost automatic . #% The Commission ' s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding . #% It is incumbent on all of us to grasp the opportunities which are before us to help build a more stable European continent at peace with itself . #% It is important to bear in mind that economic integration and getting the economy of Europe right is important . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% This leaves us as far away as ever from the UN target of spending 0.7 % of GNP on Overseas Development Aid , and not even in sight of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals . #% Social partnership has proven itself as a model with regard to how we can overcome difficulties in the workplace , ensuring proper representation for workers and also guaranteeing that enterprises have the freedom and flexibility to move forward . #% It is particularly important that the temporary workers ' agencies are not excluded from the scope , given the extent to which staffing and recruitment agencies are used in a modern , flexible labour market . #% By analogy we already have at the moment within the European Community initiatives like the Leader programme and the Urban programme where this bottom-up approach has been proven to be successful , and has resolved some of the problems that have been faced . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission . #% They are low paid with poor working conditions and their legitimate demand is that they be represented professionally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions . #% I think that farmers particularly in the peripheral regions in Ireland , Northern Ireland and Scotland have to be grateful to the Commission , Parliament and the Council for the prompt attention which has been given to this problem and the resources which have been provided to meet the worst crisis those people have faced in a whole generation . #% Therefore I would like to ask colleagues to support amendments 166/167 , 170/171 , 175 and 194 , and to oppose the inclusion of any genetic contamination threshold , which means to oppose the AGRI Committee 's amendment 41 and any others with this effect . #% We have urged Mr Giscard d'Estaing not to have his little meetings behind closed doors . #% I should like to caution and warn EU ministers in Göteborg to consider carefully the effect that a second resounding defeat would have for the Nice proposals . #% Contrary to what the cosmetics industry states , it is possible to produce and sell safe products whose ingredients have not been tested on animals . #% The report is already a compromise report and is not as strong as I certainly would like it to be . #% I would ask the services to please ensure that we are given a proper voting list tomorrow morning . #% In seeking to reinstate Parliament 's original amendments , the rapporteur has moved to strengthen the position of the citizen . #% They are an invitation to terrorists to hijack material for the making of a nuclear bomb . #% Mr President , I am probably going to be the only person here tonight with my position on this particular report . #% Their only criticism is that it has taken us too long . #% In particular , the respect for diversity that will be required in the European Union of the 21st century is encompassed by the portfolio that Commissioner Orban will have , and I call on all colleagues to be as generous as possible towards him , and to all the Commissioners , but in particular to be helpful towards him in suggesting new ways in which that diversity can be protected within the European Union . #% However , there must be punishment for those crimes for someone at some stage . #% However , I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper . #% I am angry at the arrogance and the hubris of the UK and the US in launching this war . #% Firstly , what consultation before the money is made available has been organised with research foundations , for instance universities , private research foundations and so on ? #% To maximise the potential of our work in this crucial area , we look forward to its extension to the countries of central and eastern Europe . #% Mr President , I thank Mme Guinebertière for her heroic work on this very complex document . #% There is no discrimination against the Spanish fleet . #% As co-legislators in this area , we have a great responsibility to get things right and to ensure that the end result is one which brings about a fair deal for all . #% It also promotes a much wider awareness of sexual health matters for both women and men . #% The incentives given to Xerox in Ireland comply fully with EU competition policy . #% However , the question was : What contribution the President-in-Office thought that we in the EU and he could make with regard to this global transportation safety question ? #% The challenges for us today are to ensure that we can create a proper structure for Europe in the 21st century . #% There were , for example , long delays in obtaining vital information from some countries . #% Finally , I can not understand why the Commissioner is not putting pressure on Member States to ensure that they comply with Natura 2000 in the Alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of Community interest . #% The biotech industry in Europe alleges that GM farming is inevitable . #% Contrary to received wisdom , global sugar consumption already outstrips demand . #% This is of particular importance in my region in the north west of Ireland . #% We can improve our resources . #% Our group voted against the arms industry resolution because using more funds and resources to promote the arms industry in Europe goes against what the European Union should be about . #% We should also look at questions like the disability sector , the education sector and the importance of life-long learning and education and training with regard to employment and other social exclusion problems which we discussed this morning , when we were speaking about the Van Velzen report and the Commission 's response . #% 
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , my first comment is that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a real expression of solidarity between EU citizens and States . #% This objective surely outweighs other minor or contrived objections to Nice . #% I have , along with Mrs Baldi and other members of my group , urged an embargo on armaments in the region because of the scale of the killings and abuse of human rights which is very frightening indeed . #% It falls on its knees in front of the speculators and demands that the countries worst hit by the crisis , like Greece , make savage cuts in workers ' wages , pensions and public services . #% As a company , Equitable Life was in financial trouble for a long time . #% Today , that report is being discredited by some , perhaps too sweepingly . #% This is something we must be very careful of . #% People are trying to put pressure on Ireland to say that if do not vote `` yes '' we will be stopping enlargement when this is not the case . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I also would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Hieronymi , on her work and Commissioner Reding on her work in support of this programme . #% Mr President , I would merely like to ask the House to support Mr Hume 's resolution . #% I very much welcome the proposal on the table today for common rules in the field of civil aviation . #% On balance , Mr Eurlings has done an exceptional job in producing a tough but fair report on the story of Turkish accession so far . #% We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament : for opening remarks in a Member 's maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency , people should be allowed to use their own language , even though it may not be an official working language , on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech . #% It is a very welcome precedent . #% Furthermore , any meagre fine they will be obliged to pay pales into insignificance when compared to the huge profits that they make . #% You might not quite understand what is going on , you might have to pretend you understand , but the mere fact that they are aware that you are interested and with them might in itself be a very useful way in which we can deal with this . #% I have no daylight in my office and it is an appalling insult ! #% I support the Commission ' s approach that in future negotiations with third countries , there should be a high percentage of special measures . #% I am not going to apologize , I want to put on record ... #% I expect the Commission to take on board these concerns in its review of feed legislation programmed for next year . #% In the past three years I have not been on a plane that left on time or arrived on time . #% We know that the internal market is said to have created over 2.5 million jobs within the last ten years alone . #% Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms . #% What continues to happen in Darfur is an international scandal in humanitarian terms . #% We must ensure that the equipment or networks required by multiple users to allow innovation are not withheld from the market . #% I am also very pleased with the new wording in relation to the protection of the anonymity of the donor . #% As Mr Sakellariou said , there is no justification in international law for the invasion and occupation of a country to change the regime in that country . #% However , we believe it is important not to delay the implementation of the programme , otherwise much important work could not take place . #% We need to say more about that so the public understands the relative impact that it may or may not have . #% I believe that this is the case here . #% I am a little concerned about it . #% It was not the case and hence I did not object . #% Therefore , any trade in human egg cells that may be going on from Romania to the United Kingdom is utterly reprehensible and must be condemned . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that very detailed reply . #% If the criteria the EPP seeks to apply were applied initially to the Irish process , the IRA would still be engaged in its murder campaign . #% Does the Commissioner have this information on him now ? #% There is a real fear that what is happening at the WTO will mean the death knell for many farmers , not just in Ireland , but throughout the European Union . #% Finally , the motion demands open access to all territories in Western Sahara for independent observers , NGOs and the free media . #% Does he agree with me that a directive of this sort would be an excellent contribution towards giving us credibility in the negotiations at Buenos Aires , which will be coordinated - from the European Union 's point of view - by Commissioner Bjerregaard , with whom , I understand , he is working closely ? #% The UK 's Anti-Counterfeiting Group has estimated that as many as 4 000 people lose their jobs as a result of this trade and that the GBP 1.75 billion lost in VAT alone could build four new hospitals a year . #% The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop , but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as ` members as participants in the European Community delegation ' . #% With the adoption tomorrow of Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl 's report , the final piece of the puzzle will be in place . #% But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large . #% It is in our interest to have a structured system in place at EU level to assist in the development of our own domestic requirements . #% I am glad to see here today that the tobacco industry did not get its way and that Parliament put the interests of the health of people throughout Europe before vested interests . #% Is it Euratom ? #% Tax incentives , increased aid in respect of land use to grow energy crops , and the focused use of Structural Funds : all have a part to play . #% Mr President , I am sure everyone here is aware that the Greens have fundamental problems with the European Union 's approach to fisheries agreements . #% I call on Commissioner McCreevy as a matter of urgency to reintroduce Manning of Ferries Directive , unblock the Temporary/Agency Workers Directive and fundamentally amend the Bolkenstein Directive . #% There is real fear among workers of a race to the bottom in Europe . #% How will the 2 billion in aid be distributed ? #% In Europe alone , tobacco manufacturers spend a total of # 320 million a year on tobacco advertising . #% As a long-time passionate lover of chocolate for more years than I care to remember , I am sure the Commissioner will agree that , if for sixty years people have been eating a product called `` chocolate '' , they are entitled to continue to eat the product called `` chocolate '' . #% Therefore , I was glad to see that amendments that mention ` soil moisture balance ' and ` field capacity days ' were passed at committee level . #% There is , of course , a fundamental contradiction in right-wing groups in this European Parliament claiming to stand for freedom and human rights in Pakistan , while supporting the war in Afghanistan which is having a severe spill-over effect into Pakistan with very detrimental consequences . #% It contains an answer setting out the British Government 's position in response to the proposition that there should be meetings of the Council held in public . #% I hope the scientists are right and that this improves . #% We are giving confused signals . #% In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today . #% However , I agree with her that some funding should come from the priority thematic areas for the science and society implications . #% Population-ageing , increases in the incidence of disease and increases in the treatments for them mean a greater demand for workers in the health sector . #% I would like finally to thank again the rapporteur for taking on board the serious concerns that we expressed in committee . #% Programmes will not start on 1 January 2000 , but we need to minimise delays in order not to fall into the problems and traps of the previous round of funding where late starts led to problems of underspends , delays in projects , project cancellations and difficulties in sustaining matched funding . #% Nor does it in any way pre-judge their guilt or innocence . #% I therefore say , on behalf of my Group , that we reject the attempt by the French Government to link structural fund spending to EMU criteria . #% Given the traditions of the Swedish people , this is obviously an area very close to their hearts . #% 
The reform process must , therefore , combine fairness with affordability and durability , with more simplification and efficiency . #% The problem for BNFL is that the amount of high-level liquid waste produced by reprocessing continues to increase faster than it can deal with it . #% She should have a better sense of humour on such matters . #% You can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability . #% Food consumption patterns are what is important . #% I concur with Mr Collins . #% I wish the record to be changed , if possible . #% The present proposal for a Council regulation provides for changes to the area and timing of restrictions designed to protect the spawning of the Douglas Bank herring in the Irish Sea . #% On balance , given the nature of the HFR and the mix of budget items covered , the Fine Gael delegation voted to support Draft amending budget No 8/2009 . #% Mr President , I was present . #% However , how do we ensure that this is the case ? #% But it proposes very radical changes which can potentially pose problems for some of the Member States , particularly those in the front line of terrorism . #% Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people . #% If we are to maximize the full potential of Europe 's agricultural resources , we must add value to the greatest possible extent to the indigenous resources of rural areas . #% This directive can contribute to that . #% But let me make it clear that the renomination of Mr Jacques Santer or Madame Edith Cresson or some others to the interim Commission would not be acceptable to the ELDR Group in the light of recent events . #% These are national referendums and they should be allowed to be so . #% - The EPLP delegation voted in favour of the compromise resolution on additionality because we believe that the principle of additionality is one of the core fundamental pillars of the structural funds reforms , for which I was Parliament ' s rapporteur . #% As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I was interested to see the work carried on there . #% But I must say from my understanding of what happened in Hong Kong that enormous pressure was exerted on the European model of agriculture at those talks , all in the name of helping developing countries . #% I have personal experience of this in Ireland where prices on the housing market have simply exploded . #% in writing . - Cohesion policy is a basic principle of European integration as it ensures equal development and the reduction of disparities within the EU whilst also protecting social and territorial cohesion . #% Let the managers manage . #% Mr President , those who declare that they are dedicated to fighting terrorism need to cleanse themselves of all hypocrisy and must condemn those who carry out the worst acts of bloodletting under the guise of freedom fighters . #% It is vitally important that there be a strong vote for this particular resolution . #% I have visited Gaza , because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN , and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now , when the borders are closed , Palestinian produce can not move out of the Gaza Strip . #% At the moment we depend too heavily on exporting our waste , because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so locally , despite a great catch-up over recent years . #% I also wish to congratulate the Swedish presidency on putting the notion of conflict prevention on the agenda in a much stronger way than up to now . #% That is important to recognise . #% Mr President , for a period of six weeks there was a form of peace in the Middle East and our attention turned to Iraq . #% I would never dream of going to France , Holland or Germany and telling the voters there what they should be doing . #% You only have to look at what happened in Chernobyl which again was due to a negligent attitude . #% I think it is very difficult for many people in our inner city areas to understand why they can not get access to money - over 120 million pounds - which is very badly needed . #% We have had a peace process in place for ten years or more . #% It reconciles work and family life and addresses an important health and safety issue . #% We have made this argument very clearly and we will make it again . #% The EU was concerned that a food would , for example , be advertised as ` low fat ' which might have lots of sugar or salt in it or conversely as ` low salt ' which was high in something else . #% At present there are 73 air traffic control centres in the pan-European airspace , which all operate under different codes of classification . #% If we are to engender consumer confidence , then we must ensure that there are no loopholes for defective or dangerous products . #% We have to look clearly at our policy in the Middle East and elsewhere . #% Mr President , I should like to welcome both Commissioners to the House and thank them for their time and assistance . #% Already it is estimated that at least 1 , 800 people could lose their jobs on the ferries in Ireland . #% Mr President , since 1992 LIFE -- the Financial Instrument for the Environment -- has been the major vehicle of European Community Environment policy . #% As part of the measures proposed by the Commission , animals will have to be identified by electronic transponder or tattoo , and provide evidence that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel . #% We must close loopholes on the end-use of weapons ; on where they actually go and how are they used . #% It is important to preserve the rights of Member State parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained . #% Firstly , I would like to draw attention to the debate taking place in relation to the future financing of the European Union 's annual budget . #% Like the previous report , this is a very timely reminder to us as we consider the fifth framework programme of the rationale for doing research in the European Union . #% We do not claim the status of ` primus inter pares ' but we expect and demand to be treated as an equal among equals in the European institutions . #% In terms of legislative logic you need to take the general regulation first , even though that involves only assent , and take the regulations thereafter . #% In this context , I am hopeful that improved broadband access will help stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas . #% Is that our vision for Europe ? #% There was no way out of it ; we had to face reality . #% This can only be achieved by creating a framework for taxes and other levies on pesticides and I support the plan to stop Member States from reducing VAT on pesticides . #% Speaking for myself , I can say that the Committee on Budgets has its responsibilities . #% The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health . #% The report also draws attention to the fact , and Parliament notes this , that something like 40 % of all the EUR 14 billion spent in the cereals sector goes to 3 % of farmers , and 54 % of farmers only get approximately 5 % of the aid . #% We have had the MacSharry reform , another tranche of it now . #% Now we have the chief observer on behalf of the European Union being somewhat rubbished by a statement from the Council , which was excellent in its artful dodging and with no reference to the serious flaws in the electoral process , just a bland reference to the reports of manipulation . #% He is still there . #% The German Government has already stated that it is ready to restart the shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Cumbria , and the Dutch Government has overseen the transportation of two shipments of nuclear spent material to Sellafield in recent times . #% In Europe , we are only 23 % self-sufficient in proteins . #% None of it worked , because the latest International Monitoring Committee report shows that we still have a functioning , recruiting , training , threatening and active IRA that works hand-in-glove with its junior partner , Sinn Féin , whose members , as ever , are notably absent when we debate terrorism in this House . #% Prime Minister Sharon has offered an uncompromising war on terror , but he has not offered any diplomatic solution to avoid the escalating spiral of violence and brutality . #% The European Union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines . #% We must also make sure that the information requirements in the annex are clear . #% 
Why should 5 % prevent the 95 % progress that could be made ? #% This is one of the few rights that individual Members have : to question the Commission and the Council directly in this House . #% Now there are a significant number in my group from neutral and non-neutral countries alike who are actually very much against the whole idea of the creation of a European defence identity , and the debate within the neutral countries is being conducted in an extremely dishonest fashion . #% While we accept the possibilities of biotechnology , the ethical issues must be widely addressed . #% In fact , further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides , because it would allow us to get rid of some of the misconceptions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries , or debating in our national parliaments . #% Until or unless another referendum is passed , this remains the legal position . #% Farmers and non-farmers must face this reality and do so before it is too late . #% In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free . #% I do not think that a wave of hysteria is sufficient grounds for legislation by the European Commission . #% However , as Ireland levies VRT , it is a draconian tax that has no rationale except to bleed Irish car owners of money -- a lot of money from citizens who , for the most part , do not have a public transport system that will allow them to manage without a car . #% Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is right to say it is not just quantitative , it is qualitative much more than growth . #% It sounds from his answer that they should have . #% Innovation is the very key , the very engine that will drive our economies . #% I would like to express my admiration for those who responded to the tragedy but also , if possible , to request some help with re-housing many of those who lost their homes in this tragedy . #% I have had a long-held opposition to the establishment of this office , which has been raised , not only in this context , but also on the question of cross-border criminal proceedings . #% We welcomed the launching of the general debate last year on a consistent approach to the questions of migration and asylum . #% Your proposals , Commissioner , are totally misleading . #% Indeed , it appears that while Dell was closing its manufacturing plant in Ireland , it received $ 54.5 million in State aid from the Polish Government to open a new plant in Lodz . #% Is this right and proper ? #% However , at European level serious questions continue to be raised by many of our citizens concerning democracy and the European institutions . #% Finally , there is an absolute need for positive discrimination towards women in the political system by political parties at all levels , particularly at candidate selection level . #% However , it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward . #% I am totally opposed to trying to impose this on off-road vehicles , be they vehicles that are used on farms , or the many other vehicles used in quarries or elsewhere . #% People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products . #% In particular I want to focus on Hungary . #% The Irish presidency has tabled a paper on this question which envisages the possibility of a general provision on non-discrimination as well as a suitable legal basis to adopt legislative measures to prevent such discrimination . #% This is our best opportunity to try to find a long-lasting and just peace settlement between the different traditions and the different peoples there . #% I , however , could do anything , no matter how dangerous , because I was a home carer . #% I wish to ask Commissioner Dimas specifically why he continues to allow the Irish Government to add a pollutant , fluoride , to our public drinking water supply . #% I strongly urge you to work on an Interinstitutional Agreement which involves the European Parliament in trade matters . #% Members will recall my concern on how our proposals would affect the small aircraft operators and how we could resolve that , as also those involved in leisure flying , be it in gliders , hang-gliders or microlights . #% My main reason for doing so was because of the legal uncertainty which is created by the imposition of a patent on software development , particularly when we can see the rapid advance of technology and the new small and medium sized enterprises that are starting up to create software packages specific to certain sectors of industry or business , or merely to create a new game for them to play themselves . #% It must reluctantly be said that the Irish have been less than generous in their acceptance of the population movements affecting them . #% Mr President , Ireland does not in general have a problem with stricter ELVs for new plants , as these can simply be incorporated into IPC licensing and will help achieve national emission ceilings . #% Today I speak as the representative of a city in Ireland that is the present capital of culture : Cork . #% That is what the Tánaiste said to the House this morning . #% I would ask that you , Mr President , and this House give full support for the release of the three captives and that you raise this immediately with the Council and the Commission to gain their support . #% Such nominations would risk provoking even deeper crises . #% By that commitment to those areas we would begin to show that we are giving them a lifeline for some kind of a future and that they have not been forgotten . #% Poverty is a result of the actions of human beings and it can be resolved by the actions of intelligent human beings . #% Nevertheless , we need to keep pushing for the ILO to be granted observer status in , and the right to speak at , the WTO , and a committee on trade and decent work should be created within the WTO . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , we are all aware of the importance of bees in pollination . #% In recent years the presence of both national and EU patrol vessels has more or less succeeded in enforcing the 2.5 kilometre length limit , except in the Mediterranean . #% The lack of harmonised enforcement rules means that counterfeiting is a low-risk business where for a low investment counterfeiting pirates are guaranteed enormous profits . #% This presents us with a great opportunity to send out a very strong message to those people who are putting their own capital at risk that we are willing to act with them as joint partners in creating new enterprises , new jobs and , in particular , new economic wealth . #% On a global scale , more people -- especially children -- die every day from the effects of malaria than have been killed so far by avian influenza . #% So there is a great need for urgency . #% Mr Santer might like to reassure us that the concerns of older workers will be taken into account in his deliberations in Luxembourg . #% One thing is very clear : the new European monetary area , though it is wholly open to trade , will have a very different degree of openness to the separate Member State economies . #% We are all struggling in the e-commerce world to get legislation that is right , to get the right balance between self-regulation and a regulatory framework which gives minimum guarantees . #% We have no competence in this Parliament . #% Finally , as has been said by Mrs Ewing , Chernobyl is not a unique plant . #% You should increase the pressure on the seven Member States which have either failed to ratify or failed to sign the Convention . #% There may be cause for action elsewhere . #% I strongly support the suggestion that the EU should step up its efforts to meet the target of 3 % of GDP investment in research and development . #% It is now up to us to be generous in our praise of those countries , to give them genuine encouragement and not lectures on how their systems should operate , to give them our experience with the open method of coordination , under which you look at practices in other countries and take the best of them and try to achieve the best possible result . #% The consumer must still have the right to go to court as a last resort . #% Let me commend your efforts to try to meet the timetable . #% I believe , however , that KEDO was ill designed from the start , neither addressing North Korea 's immediate energy needs , nor delivering technology adaptable to the country 's infrastructure . #% I know France is part of the troika and will be taking up the presidency in July . #% Following on from that , domestic workers should be in a stronger position to exercise their rights . #% We look forward to receiving the Commission 's analysis of the economic and political developments since the freezing of the previous application in 1996 . #% The liberalisation of services very often benefits those in areas of dense population at the expense of consumers in less-populated areas . #% We welcome this because we are assured that these measures can be implemented relatively quickly . #% In the Scandinavian countries support for the single currency is rising . #% I do not think anybody in this house could in any way condone the violent reaction in certain countries in the Middle East to the publication of those cartoons and caricatures . #% 
They will contribute to achieving the Lisbon objective , namely of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 . #% Looking at the first 200 vacancies , the range of jobs is extensive . #% We must be guided by the humanitarian imperative . #% Mr President , would you get into a plane flown by a pilot who was exhausted and had worked more than 70 hours in a week ? #% This represents another step in the important work of rebuilding the confidence of European consumers in the quality and safety of European food products - as the Commissioner has often said - ` from farm to fork ' . #% Madam President , I believe the document that is before us today is a very significant document . #% It is up to any Member State in response to the proposal to make whatever proposals it considers would be helpful in all the circumstances . #% The Spanish government is dealing with one of the most difficult tasks - how to bring internal , politically driven violence to an end . #% Uneven opening of the market between countries brings huge resentment . #% I was going up and down in the lift when the doors jammed and I could hardly get here in time for the debate . #% But the reward for your success , which is what we expect and what we will help you with , will be a new confirmation of the wisdom of working together in international cooperation in the European Union . #% A further safeguard is that commercial scale is defined as acts resulting in commercial and financial gain . #% I have problems with any continuation of the use of tattoos , and the Environment Committee is of the same view . #% The Laeken Declaration made clear both the extent of the achievements of the European Union over the past 45 years and the scale of the challenges which it now faces . #% A quota of the size demanded by Mercosur would completely undermine Ireland 's beef production . #% The report also asks for an analysis of possible options for sanctions against tax havens , which we support without prejudice to a final position . #% Military action without UN approval will increase antagonisms between the West and the Muslim world ; it will inflame the Middle East and it will deal a devastating blow , not only to the credibility of the UN , but also to the future potential of the European Union Common and Foreign Security Policy . #% And again I would congratulate the Commission in the past 12 months on the deepening and extension of the information and communications policy . #% It sends out a clear signal to anyone else who wants to do this : basically break the law , ignore it , and the Commission will help you at the end of the day . #% In December , North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material . #% Perhaps he could clean up the litter . #% I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling . #% We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element , as the Treaty states , in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute . #% BSE , SARS and the recent avian influenza concerns have all , to our cost , underlined the imperative of having proactive , pre-emptive coordinated action in the area of health . #% It was very disappointing to see so many people in this Parliament not support an amendment that would have given people some sort of protection in relation to protecting their basic civil liberties . #% We support democratic change in Yugoslavia and the European Union has rightly started to implement pilot projects based on the energy-for-democracy initiative . #% The European Union has to impose an arms embargo on Indonesia . #% In other words new light goods vehicles will now have to respect requirements that are broadly similar to the ones that are already applied to passenger cars . #% The draft Treaty presented to our EU leaders in Thessaloniki forms the basis for discussions on a final agreed text at European Union level . #% A yes or no answer will do . #% If this is not reversed , then , quite frankly , the European Union will be guilty of putting the dairy farmers in my region out of business . #% There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply . #% All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position , Madam President . #% Beyond the visible and immediate effects on children , the World Health Organization 's scientists concluded that radioactivity has a range of effects on health , including higher rates of cancers and heart disease . #% We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future . #% In his submissions and hearings with our group he spoke about his role as an honest broker . #% There can be no question that all future development in the sector must be on a sustainable basis . #% The US Government has avowed its intention to hand over the sovereignty of Iraq to a representative Iraqi Government at a very early date . #% I think we should remember this . #% I would like to take the debate in a different direction . #% I am very happy to support this report . #% The Prestige disaster highlights not only the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation which you referred to in your answer , designed to prevent the recurrence of such incidents , but also the lack of an adequate EU response mechanism . #% The logging industry in these countries is implicated in corruption and in the exploitation of workers and the deforestation involved is a huge threat to the livelihoods of the indigenous people . #% Heed the clamour for more state rights , not centralisation ; more local control , not ` Brusselisation ' . #% We appreciate that no major breakthrough on any of the important issues at the IGC is likely until after the British general election . #% However , I would like to point out that this applies as much to the Member States of the European Union as it does to countries that share our borders . #% It is very important that we look at this question when it comes up in the House . #% One amendment I have difficulty with is the proposal to reduce NOx emission limits from 650 to 200 . #% My fear is that Thursday evening is not the optimum time to try to do it . #% We must ensure that , in regulating food marketing , we do not kill off the remaining traditional local farmers ' markets . #% This is the core of the challenges we now face . #% We know about the problem of black-market fish and what they can do to a market situation at a given time . #% I would like to mention another point . #% It is appropriate that data banks be set up at national level concerning persons found guilty of paedophile activities and everything possible must be done to make it easier for children to provide evidence to the court without fear . #% When we had swine fever , we gave EUR 800 million to German and Dutch farmers . #% What is happening here is that , by refusing to allow people to speak in this Parliament , by refusing to ensure that people abide by the Treaties and constitution of this Parliament and of the European Union , we are failing to fulfil our duty to set an example to people . #% However , it seems to me that , in its emphasis , the Commission gives primacy to removing obstacles to the provision of services and the orderly functioning of the internal market . #% So we are not being given the right to determine first whether we agree with the principle or not and vote on all the amendments related to that . #% With these reservations , I am pleased to support the report . #% I think you agree , Madam President , that Parliament has not covered itself in glory with its tied result today . #% Mr President , the link between the common foreign and security policy and space policy is very clear , both in the Commission 's White Paper and in the resolution . #% In conclusion , I am pleased that Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has recognised the need to take into account social and economic factors , such as employment in coastal areas . #% Yet I am always concerned that having more documents does not lead to transparency . #% The committee did , however , agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet . #% So we must look to the opportunities and take them , and not the negatives . #% The pilots for these jets are due to be trained in Wales . #% 
Mr President , as we discuss the war in Iraq we should realise immediately that never in the history of the world has there been a war in which the vast majority of victims have not been innocent civilians . #% This operation is going to go ahead , and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission 's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups . #% Since control measures might harm the industry , we also must support the rapporteur 's plea for the issuing of new compensatory training and reconversion measures . #% This was the justification , despite what some people were saying all along about the situation . #% One of the clearest memories I have of that time is the rush with which many of our European governments ran to press to claim that in some mysterious way the contamination had wondrously blown away from their countries and not polluted their countries , so that they could sell their radishes , lettuces and cabbages without anyone assuming - horror of horrors - that they had also been affected by the disaster of Chernobyl . #% It is appalling to think that in 2006 , in a European Union which prides itself on its commitment both to freedom of trade and freedom of movement , a Member State can be plagued by an organisation so vicious that even the world 's biggest oil companies can not survive its menace . #% The presidency 's proposals for the use of qualified majority voting , and acting on the proposal for an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs , represent a step in the right direction . #% I believe this regulation certainly helps to put flesh on the bones of Aarhus . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mme Gradin . #% How best do we serve this purpose ? #% If Sellafield sinks we will all sink with it . #% As regards the architecture profession , however , I would like to draw attention to the issue of Recital 21 . #% We finally have synchronised guidelines and we need to do the best we can , faced with the situation we now have . #% Secondly , concerning the Stern report on economic environmental matters , I know you can not speak on behalf of Finland but I also know it has one of the best records on alternative energy use and recovery of energy . #% We know , and we have heard here this evening , that many thousands of our citizens suffer from this disease and related syndrome throughout the European Union . #% Instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions . #% Reducing fatalities and deaths on our roads must remain as the central political goal . #% Discrimination still exists , and it still takes women with `` fire in their bellies '' to make it through the dense system of hidden prejudice and break through in political , trade and other organisations . #% It is for these reasons I believe that those detractors who are voicing concerns about the operation of the Irish economy are over-reacting . #% Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development , combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes . #% I very much agree with what my colleague Mrs Doyle said , and I do not actually feel that the Commissioner answered her questions adequately . #% The Commission already has a wonderful process of consultation in place with social partners . #% The European Union has committed over EUR 200 million in recent years to help rebuild Afghanistan , and the European Union must take the decision financially to support the Iranian Government for a number of years so as to ensure that the basic social infrastructural and educational needs are addressed in the reconstruction process of Bam . #% People in close proximity can come , other people can not . #% I am happy to agree with the opinion put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which suggests that the Commission should analyse whether the Nitrates Directive can be repealed from 2008 . #% Parliament has now called for action , with this majority support . #% I want to echo the concerns of many people in Ireland and the international community about the circumstances surrounding this murder . #% At the end of a long process , may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way , our shadows and everyone else involved . #% There can not be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries . #% Who , then , could have dreamt that , in the second half of that century , those same peoples would unite ? #% They have failed miserably in their responsibility to protect public health . #% Under what rule or regulation did you write the letter ? #% I wonder if you have also detected that unwillingness , and which Member States would you say are concerned about the future and which Member States fear that they may be asked to pay for enlargement ? #% I understood that we could not be arrested in such circumstances . #% We will be voting in favour but , nonetheless , we will do so with reservations on many of the paragraphs and recommendations . #% That is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments . #% I am an Irish Member of the European Parliament and we in Ireland know how difficult that can be . #% Proper safeguards will be needed . #% As far as Hong Kong is concerned , I welcome the fact that the handover has taken place without many of our worst fears having been realised . #% We need a respectful dialogue between our institutions . #% But before we embark on such a radical decision , we should look at the history , particularly in the United States , of the relationship between security authorities and public figures and recognise that we could overstep the mark by giving such powers to OLAF . #% I hope that the Taliban regime can be defeated and replaced by a broader alliance of political groupings in Afghanistan . #% I agree with President Santer 's claim that the European Veterinary Office based in County Meath in Ireland can play a vital role in restoring consumers ' confidence in food safety procedures . #% It is important in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 that measures under the various EU programmes be screened so as to guarantee that they comply with all national and EU legislation in the field of equal opportunities . #% In fact , in the United States , it produces less energy than wood , even having cost that much . #% In relation to Amendment No 5 I fully support it . #% Unfortunately , the rapporteur had to take the brunt of most of the negotiations , but she certainly had to work very hard to ensure this report got through within the necessary timeframe , which was very important as we were under pressure to secure the extension of her derogation which was due to run out in June of this year . #% However , a commercially successful Irish airline competing in the European market , Ryanair , is currently engaged in a protracted trade dispute with its employees arising from the company 's refusal to recognize or negotiate with the trade union chosen by some of the employees to represent them or to cooperate with the national industrial conciliation procedures which have been established to resolve such disputes . #% In Ireland , as elsewhere , violence against women is a very significant problem , with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime . #% When , therefore , we consider the recently signed agreement with Mauritania , costing EUR 430 million over five years , the Senegal agreement is very modest in financial terms . #% Parliament does not have legislative powers in the area of criminal law , which is best decided at national level . #% We intend to remain vigilant at all times so as to guarantee that confidence in the European food chain is fully restored , sooner rather than later . #% So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion . #% This is a big gap and we must continue to put pressure on Member States if we want a coherent policy . #% Therefore I leave it to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find a solution that will satisfy some of my constituents back in the north-west of England . #% It is a sad commentary on moral probity in this House that one who dares to hold to moral rectitude is so relentlessly vilified . #% If the Commission is being consistent in wanting to have a more ecological and sustainable approach to fishing , then surely it should not do that . #% The industry would still be subject to monitoring , reporting and verification requirements . #% I should like to know why an exhibition by a lesbian artist was banned from this Parliament . #% The UK gets 40 % of all foreign investment which comes into the European Union . #% We must not underestimate the magnitude of this task . #% You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty . #% Let me remind you that in your own Presidency programme , you set yourself the twin tasks of ` increased effectiveness and greater openness in the field of human rights ' . #% Will the Commission address this issue ? #% We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these . #% Thank you very much for your contribution here this evening . #% 
Recent reports concerning the future of CAP are certainly worrying . #% ` Stupid ' energy would use electricity and gas to heat the air outside buildings rather than insulating the buildings . #% The ambition to gain an EU seat within an enlarged Security Council has to be pursued . #% I come to international activities , because the research framework programme must look outside the EU as well . #% Mr President , I too would like to wish Mrs Damião a full and speedy recovery and thank her for her work on this report . #% The European policy which seeks to assist us with the development of our afforestation is not all that popular in Ireland and yet I believe it is wise in the long run . #% The initial advice which I have received is that citizenship , as described in the Union Treaties , applies to all persons who are citizens of a Member State . #% It is time we got our act together and resolved these decision-making problems . #% I know that Mrs Zrihen , our socialist shadow , who unfortunately can not be here this evening , appreciated the way in which he worked . #% By coming down from the present position to 150 GWP , there is at least a ten-fold decrease -- 1000 % -- in emissions and there would be negligible extra benefit -- about 2.6 % -- in setting a GWP threshold at 50 . #% The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully . #% I have every confidence in their ability to do so . #% Each year we have reports in Parliament on this issue but the rights of certain sections of society continue to be ignored . #% This centre will be funded from the EU Budget and will come into existence next year . #% Equality of opportunity must mean that all jobs , all services that are available , are open to all equally . #% This Directive now calls on Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services , including environmental and resource costs , in accordance with the polluter-pays principle . #% How is it done ? #% I fully support my Socialist Group 's demand that this whole matter be investigated by a European Parliament Committee of Inquiry . #% By its nature what he has done is straightforward and millions of people do exactly what he has done . #% As a share of GDP , the EU invests less than the US and Japan in research and development , and venture capital investment is also lacking . #% Thus , the balance shifted in favour of restrictions which are so burdensome that they have the potential to drive parts of our chemical industry out of the EU . #% As someone has already pointed out in this debate , not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same . #% Madam President , I suppose that those of us who have remained can be thankful to Commissioner Bolkestein for being late . #% However , when you look more closely at the scientific and empirical data available on bird flu , you see certain trends emerging . #% With Blair having agreed to surrender the British rebate by stages and as the real cost of enlargement builds , the situation will only get worse . #% The Palestinian leadership has been presented with a list of security messages by the United States Government that will have to be implemented . #% I want to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission because in all the heated debates we have had nobody has stopped to thank those members of the Commission who have worked very hard for the people of Europe , the people we all here tried to represent . #% Training and Skills of researchers ; #% In its over-zealousness to protect the cotton-weed , the local council decided to ban the pilgrimage from the immediate area . #% Their first need is to be safe . #% Another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting . #% Who will speak for the downtrodden and the oppressed ? #% Committed as I am to rural policies , I now believe they will not achieve their full potential in the absence of integrated national and regional policy . #% Mr President , I wish to speak on the stability pact on behalf of the ELDR Group . #% Each year two billion tonnes of different goods pass through European ports . #% The present Commission has now acted responsibly and satisfactorily on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry . #% The new technical standards we voted for will ensure that wheelchair access is available for public transport . #% Fundamentally , we all want to support an end to political violence in Spain . #% This initiative specifies that it should include trafficking in human beings , and I wish to insist that this should also include the smuggling of illegal immigrants , prostitution rings and the sexual exploitation of children . #% In April 1994 there were seven major proposals sent from this Parliament , one of the last pieces of legislation passed in this Parliament concerning the lesser-used languages , which were sent both to the Commission and the Council . #% All new vehicles manufactured in the Union will be subject to compliance with the technical requirements and measures which will reduce their environmental impact , decrease associated noise pollution and increase their road safety . #% While what has happened in Asia is unfortunate , we have to protect the European market , because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry . #% This resolution calls for the Commission to analyse options for such a tax and sends a clear signal that Europe will push for a global agreement to deliver on the public 's demand for action . #% Mr Watson referred to the previous President Bush and the fact that to some extent the most recent President Bush maybe hopes to resolve some of his father 's failures . #% We are all behind that fight , but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon . #% As a so-called civilised country , it totally ignores international opinion on this issue . #% Surely now is the time , under this presidency , to reverse the decision . #% I feel disappointed , too , at the broken understanding , if not broken promise , and the failure of the Council of Ministers to recognize the European Parliament 's codecision powers . #% Even the notion of citizenship is distinct from being a citizen . #% I quote the words of the Commission : `` Unlike beef and other commodities , the Community is deficient in sheepmeat and , under the present regimes , there is a major exodus from sheep production , especially in northern Europe . #% 80 % of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region . #% We are going to have to address this problem a lot more quickly , in particular we finally have to address the extremely sensitive issue of incineration which in most countries , I believe , causes local problems when it is mooted . #% In view of the committee report on Echelon , we should address the issue with some urgency . #% Is the European Union going to stand by and allow China to become the trading partner of the developing world within a generation ? #% I hope this House agrees that this is a value that Europe was built on . #% The Commission has already presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet , in line with the provisions of the Council of Europe ' s cyber crime convention . #% It also deals with the law in Belgium which apparently allows the arrest of people suspected of war crimes . #% It is obvious from the hearings - indeed without them it is obvious - that there are major areas of overlap and therefore potential conflict in operational responsibilities within the college . #% - Mr President , Members will be aware that the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , as indeed in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , was dominated by the concerns we had about the legal basis which was used , which only provides for consultation with Parliament . #% US experience tells us that software patents do not encourage innovation and R&D but , in fact , weaken the market and suffocate small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as those starting out in the market . #% It is time for this place - MEPs , the Commission and officials - to get real . #% For the reason that I had tabled the amendment to the motion for a resolution in Mr Fabra Vallés ' report calling for the rotation of all information officer appointments at Grade A level in Parliament 's offices in national capitals , I asked the Secretary-General , the incoming President and the Vice-President to examine the case of rotating the Grade A staff around the cities of Europe on a four-year rotation basis . #% The most moving sight during the Irish presidency was the raising of the flags of our ten new partner countries at Aras an Uachtarain , the home of the Irish President . #% We have to reassure European farmers and say to them there are regulations in place , those regulations grant entitlements to European farmers and there is no possibility whatever happens that those obligations can be denied by the European Union . #% Madam President , we make this subject sound very complicated but for me it boils down to two questions : how much fish can we take , and who can take them ? #% The Commission 's reform proposal does not contain any contingency plans for unexpected economic and social restructuring in the regions . #% 
It behoves us , as politicians , not to be raising fears and using terms which alarm people . #% So , the reality is that good laws that are well drafted , easy to implement , easy to enforce and police , are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market . #% However , I urge the Commission to bring to fruition the compensation package promised to beef producers . #% Any deviation from the general democratic process can not be a solution to solve political problems within Pakistan . #% We as a country have become familiar with Lebanon through family members or friends or neighbours who were stationed there and we feel the damage inflicted on their country all the more for this . #% The ACP governments , on the other hand , need to show an increased commitment to fighting against tax havens , tax evasion and illicit capital flight . #% Is politics really the art of the possible or have we lost sight of the core values of the society that we purport to represent ? #% Negotiations can only begin when Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria . #% Mr President , I rise to speak on the subject of the Middle East so that I can dissociate myself from the motion for a resolution tabled by my group and the voting stance it adopted on the issue . #% Commissioner , you can not control what is on the web , but you can control access in the following way . #% If we are to make progress as fast as possible in our efforts to improve Community health , we should be creating an incentive for the use of this product in order that a major health gain can be made . #% Madam President , I wish to join with the others in complimenting all involved , particularly on bringing this through conciliation successfully . #% I voted for the Bakopoulos report to ensure our seas are safe and that ship pollution is prevented . #% The challenges facing the European Union are too great for institutional deadlock to hamper the Commission and the European Parliament in dealing with their legislative programme . #% The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great . #% But we did achieve a deal on Article 9 : we forced the Commission and the Council to freeze the article and to have a group of company law experts to examine key issues , and to come back to Parliament in March 2002 . #% Last week 's events , however , saw an unfortunate and heated debate on the financial situation of the European Union . #% As I said to you in London last week , I believe we are standing at the dawn of a new future . #% The amendments which the Commission can not support are : 1 , 2 , 6 to 13 , 15 , 16 , 18 to 22 , 24 to 30 , 32 , 33 , 35 to 50 . #% Mr President , I would like to address one particular aspect of the draft general budget for 2004 in so far as it relates to the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , of which I am a member . #% It is unacceptable that European multinational companies are investing in and backing up a system where large-scale gross violations of human rights are taking place . #% It is important that we consider the needs of peripheral European countries who encounter several geographic barriers that depend on a strong transport network to supply their countries , and for their economic growth . #% The motion calls on the authorities of all three countries to make progress in specific areas . #% We oppose attempts to turn the EU into a superstate or a military and economic superpower . #% First of all competitiveness of the European Union . #% I have no doubt that the Commissioner will assist in reaching a satisfactory resolution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in relation to this very important and very crucial area . #% Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this . #% Therefore we have to accept our own responsibility for that . #% I should also like to welcome in particular paragraph 37 of the report in which there is a proposal to mobilize local and regional authorities , together with the close participation of Community and women 's groups who are active in promoting heritage and culture at grass-roots level . #% However , Rule 127 states that the President must make a decision on whether or not he will accept the point of order , and that he may wait for up to 24 hours before he makes that decision . #% A lot of these new technologies are too expensive for ordinary users to get access to . #% That such a thing should be true in this Parliament is an absolute disgrace . #% It is of the utmost importance that consumer information campaigns about the timetable and effects of the new euro currency continue in the run-up to the introduction of euro notes and coins in the year 2002 . #% However , the Council has flatly rejected all amendments on democratic scrutiny and delegated acts , without proposing any alternative solution which would satisfy Parliament 's demands . #% Uniquely in the world , Europe is developing a democratic form of transnational governance . #% We are exporting live animals to be processed in other countries and then we complain about the unemployment problem in Ireland . #% The Commission 's communication is a first step towards having a strategy that covers prevention and recycling . #% We in this Parliament decided to terminate our parliamentary relationship with Pakistan . #% However , I was and I am totally opposed to the amendments which have been adopted and which support the harmonisation of taxes . #% I have seen documents from the works council that suggest that production will be moved to India . #% Of course , I am impressed by the quality of the legislation and by the fact that this is the way to solve problems internationally , that everybody sits down and makes agreements . #% We can not stop technology , but neither can we allow it to render copyright dead or to let it be abused as a safe haven for piracy , parasites and mass illegal copying . #% This particularly applies to islands , where it is not simple or easy to get the kind of technology or the kind of expertise that linking up with the nearest major hospital - with a consultant at one end and the local doctor or nurse at the other end - can provide . #% The production of high-quality regional products , and food products in particular , is essential if many of our rural areas are to be saved from depopulation . #% Listening to discussions in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , it is not clear if these concerns are grounded or not . #% All these experiences , particularly those in recent days , underline how essential it is for the EU to strengthen its foreign policy role , including its defence and military capabilities , so that a proper equilibrium can be established in our transatlantic relationship . #% The strong transnational dimension of the problem requires the establishment of high standards of Community law in relation to child sexual exploitation , standards that also apply to the CEEC countries where the problems are even greater than within the Union . #% This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission - it should have started in January this year . #% What the Commissioner has said is that he is leaving it up to the Member States to pursue those areas where preferential access has been granted illegally . #% The EU , as one of the most important regions from all these points of view , clearly has a special responsibility . #% Knowing all this , why would President Bush take this irrational decision ? #% The great value of this particular piece of legislation is that we hope that many countries that , due to their own judicial systems , were unwilling to sign the Hague Convention of 1980 on the transnational abduction of children , will see their way to signing this piece of legislation , thus ensuring the safe and quick return of children who have been abducted . #% They spread with increasing ease around the world as a result of population movements and the expansion of trade . #% Consequently , the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses . #% The countries that have high tax , high unemployment and low growth are the ones that want to harmonise tax . #% Unfortunately our minister has today ruled out any kind of independent inquiry into this . #% We are now producing something like 27 % of our needs from farmed fish and there is no reason why we can not continue . #% I urge the European Commission to proceed immediately with a legal examination of this law and its implementation and , if necessary , to take action in relation to Hungary to ensure that this law is amended and brought into line with the fundamental values on which the European Union is based . #% It is not necessary to complicate EC legislation further by founding it on multiple legal bases . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to convey a very warm and hearty welcome to the Irish Minister for European Affairs on this , his first visit to a plenary session of the European Parliament . #% If Madame Garaud is not in a position , for perfectly understandable reasons , to undertake the mission that you have conferred on her , it could be advisable to see if , in such circumstances , an alternative may be found , if only because it is important for the Presidency of this House to be able to assure Members , as I believe we were assured at a prolonged debate of the Conference of Presidents , that you have acted with concern for due process and with propriety at all times . #% I know it is very late and we are testing your patience . #% This would provide for codecision with this Parliament in any further legislation they bring forward in this area . #% However , there are dangers in drawing parallels between the Irish Peace Process and the situation that currently exists in Spain . #% It is obvious that hydrogen energy represents an alternative to fossil fuels , but there are other possible alternatives , such as bio-energy , which is relevant to sustainable land use . #% The other major downside is that ten weeks have gone by arguing about peripheral issues such as the ban on derivatives while ignoring the real fears of consumers and the plight of beef producers . #% 
In the light of a recent reform of the common agricultural policy , the current position of Parliament , which would suggest cofinancing , will not be viewed very well by our farmers and rural dwellers . #% While incineration is getting a lot of adverse publicity , and recent planning decisions in Ireland have certainly raised the crucial question of the location of incinerators , it is difficult to envisage a complete programme of waste disposal without incineration , particularly in relation to toxic waste , and in this regard consideration must be given to finding locations where the facility will not impact badly on the natural environment . #% I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian . #% From an Irish perspective , with the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear installations only 60 miles from our shores , it is just unacceptable that the British Government can sign up for the European Energy Charter without its own nuclear industry being obliged to comply with those provisions . #% It is absolutely essential that we enshrine in European law the right to join trade unions and the right to bargain collectively . #% I believe that is now possible . #% Can I congratulate you on a successful presidency ? #% The negotiations focus on two central elements . #% These laws protected basic trade union rights and their removal is a very worrying development . #% Many of our citizens are asking this now . #% After the adoption and publication of this regulation , data brought to the attention of the Commission necessitated its incorporation into this regulation . #% We need to engage with citizens , producers and consumers regarding reduction , reuse and recycling of waste . #% And even at the final debriefing of heads of mission in Islamabad , little or no opposition to our analysis was expressed . #% In relation to trade names and individual companies it is very important that a vague system of alerts is in place which allows the consumer to make a choice . #% Following the Dublin Summit there seems to be a consensus in favour of agreeing on a revised Treaty at the Amsterdam meeting of June next year . #% We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict . #% It was suggested in a document entitled ` The future financing of the European Union ' , issued by the Commission before Christmas , that possibly 25 % of the CAP should be financed by the national exchequers of individual Member States . #% Others have not acted appropriately . #% Today there are 6.5 billion people in the world and Europe makes up only 9 % of it . #% We have a right to answers and the US Government should cooperate with all of us to ensure that clarification on the issues raised is secured and that human rights and human dignity are not swept under the carpet in this fight . #% Mr President , we can not deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light . #% How can we claim that our ingredients are local if they are all modified in a laboratory ? #% I am hopeful and confident that the European Commission will now bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to ensure that passenger rights for the citizens of the European Union are greatly improved as a matter of urgency . #% If we can control them and use them for our good , it is a great thing ; but by scale and virtue of size it is impossible for a mouse to control what an elephant will do ' . #% A selective interpretation of Lisbon gave our countries ' financial planners an excuse to push profit , even where it was at the expense of people . #% I welcome the inclusion of PFOA - perfluorooctanic acid - in the scope of this directive . #% We also tabled the amendment to require the Commission to come forward with a study in this area . #% In the conclusions of the Convention , fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy , instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence . #% If such an invitation is received , it will receive careful and favourable consideration . #% The proposal has many good ideas including : outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted ; rules for deciding about fishing , given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort . #% Are people who specialize in producing female animals rather than male animals going to be left out once again ? #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Macartney for his report which is well done and represents the views and concerns of the Committee on Fisheries . #% This is not a resolution for doing nothing , as many Americans would say , but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning . #% We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world 's leading media broadcasters . #% I support what Mr Poettering said . #% From the point of view of consumers , the Liberal Group believes , subject to the observations I have already made , that consumers should be assured of quality and accessibility of public services and we respect and commend the principle of universality . #% What is more inexcusable is that we have tolerated this . #% There is no effective mechanism to hold Commissioner Mandelson to account . #% It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area . #% While dealing swiftly with the debt of countries affected by the tsunami , the international community must not lessen the priority to focus on the need to cancel the unpayable debt of poor countries to enable them to progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals . #% Without the political support and the goodwill of the people of Europe , the EU as a political and economic entity will be badly weakened . #% Yes , Commissioner , there is no need to paint the picture of the return of the Spanish Armada . #% It is completely unacceptable to torture animals in order to , supposedly , improve ourselves . #% The European Union should ensure that car manufacturers construct all cars for the European market equipped fully with mobile phone kits . #% We have lost a brave and distinguished friend and I would like to express my thanks to the Irish presidency for the acknowledgment of the life and work of Archbishop Courtney made by An Taoiseach Bertie Ahern during his response to yesterday 's debate . #% in writing . - I strongly support this report as another step in the building of real European political parties which can act on a pan-European basis . #% We can not stress enough that closing the gap between poor and rich Member States - achieving cohesion - means Member States must take the responsibility seriously . #% The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination . #% As well as the concerns that have already been expressed , I should like to draw the Commission 's attention to paragraph 15 of my colleague 's report which calls on the Council and Commission to encourage the closure of unsafe nuclear power stations in Europe . #% These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe . #% I hope that the Irish people will once again give a strong endorsement for my country 's continued participation in the European Union as they have done on each of the three previous occasions when a European referendum has been held in Ireland . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Taoiseach , the Tánaiste , Mr De Rossa and also Minister Mitchell and Irish civil servants for clearly demonstrating once and for all that a small nation can not only shoulder the responsibility of hosting the EU presidency but can discharge its task with great success . #% I want to wish you all well : Mr Prodi , Mr Kinnock and everybody else who is taking on enormous responsibilities on behalf of the people of the European Union . #% It is heartbreaking for any family to lose a member through a road accident , but it is even more tragic and traumatic when the repatriation of a broken body is needed . #% On a separate but related matter , I was quite disturbed to read that depleted uranium shells have been fired into the Irish Sea by British Ministry of Defence forces at the Solway Firth between England and Scotland and also at a range on the Cumbrian coast , just seven miles from a British nuclear plant . #% This is an essential tool for communicating how Member States treat European law . #% Last year it was climate change , and both climate change and biodiversity loss are the two greatest environmental challenges facing us . #% Forgive me for being sceptical . #% That is the one way of guaranteeing that we can keep a food source going , provide employment and protect environmental considerations within our fishing waters . #% At present we have Meryl Streep making a film based on one of our twentieth century playwrights . #% Is the Commissioner satisfied that the vigilance and disinfection facilities at all ports and airports in the EU , but particularly in Ireland and Great Britain , are as they should be , and has he a role in that area ? #% Each member on their boards and principal committees is a volunteer -- there are 15 000 of them in my own country -- as are the majority of their staff , except in the larger credit unions which have up to 2000 paid employees . #% This cooperation will not be complete if we exclude the main actors affected by the fisheries policy , namely fishermen , producers ' organisations and vessel owners . #% The European Union is determined to play its part in reaching our targeted 8 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels over this decade . #% The use of maximum sustainable yield or any of a number of other reference points is quite simply wrong , for they lead to over-fishing and stock collapse . #% The economic and social development of islands is very important and requires special measures such as the flexibility requested in terms of competition regulations . #% 
One way that we could do this , perhaps on a trial basis , is with a third type of organisation which also incorporates the Economic and Social Committee . #% By the standards that they apply , I want to state categorically that the Commission would pass with first-class honours : our rate of fraud and error is below what is acceptable in those countries . #% We want to ask you about your willingness , your personal willingness , to accept that you are accountable and responsible to the public of Europe in whatever you do with your President and before this House and in clear and full public understanding that this is the public forum for European democracy to which you are accountable and have a public responsibility . #% The situation has changed so much since the matter was discussed by the Council of Presidents that I would urge you to find time , perhaps during the discussion of the regulation you have just referred to , for us to have a Commission update this week here in Parliament . #% If sometimes that means allowing for international adoptions , then that should be the case . #% I would also ask colleagues to consider this particular situation and support our amendment , which is number 89 . #% Ministers go on here with very long replies . #% Commissioner Solbes and all my Spanish colleagues have my heartfelt sympathy . #% This will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an EU-wide basis . #% Madam President , at least three times I went searching for our Finnish colleague to assure him , as I was assured in the last plenary part-session , that he would be handed a card that would enable him to not just hear , but to see Finnish television in Parliament . #% Animals should not be transported for long periods where at all possible , and the standards and the quality of lorries must be monitored very closely , especially the ventilation . #% I hope that the Council will not give in to this . #% We have a major responsibility as a Parliament to ensure that any future reform ensures that agriculture as an industry can compete and can survive in the future . #% Thank you for agreeing to take the question . #% No wonder The Wall Street Journal the other day carried an article with Adams and bin Laden linked together . #% With a cattle population in Ireland of between 7 and 8 million in recent years , some 10.5 million TB tests have been undertaken annually in some 138 000 herds . #% There is no doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross-border and North-South initiatives funded under this programme . #% To date , the British Government has refused to conduct an international environmental impact assessment on the significant risks posed to the environment and people 's health along the transportation routes of nuclear waste . #% We are presenting conflicting messages and proposals to the people of the candidate countries . #% I hope there will be majority support for his nomination in the House tomorrow , and I am delighted that our group will be fully endorsing and supporting his nomination for Commission President . #% Finally , with regard to the paper industry : it should clean up its bad former record on the pollution of the environment , and it is also important to inquire into the difficulties of monopolies in the paper sector , particularly with regard to cartels in the recycling sector . #% Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe , but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area . #% The test ban alone only serves to export the problem as cosmetics tested on animals in countries outside the EU will continue to be sold in the EU . #% In his discussions with the Italian presidency and the incoming Irish presidency , has he had any commitments from them that it will also be a priority for the Council ? #% There are two main reasons for this , neither of which has anything to do with the lack of a communication strategy . #% Mr President , the EU Convention comes at a very important moment in the life of the European Union . #% I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on his report . #% We really need an extremely tight clampdown on how mining industries operate and a future directive on mining waste is extremely important . #% Moving on to the various proposals within the work programme , I welcome the initiatives now being taken on a communication on children 's rights . #% It is extremely important that a precautionary approach is taken here . #% Europe 's society can not continue to tolerate that and to pursue policies that are clearly failing . #% I welcome it and largely agree with the assessment and authorisation procedures it proposes . #% After the last case and after the slaughter of the last vaccinated animal it is necessary to regain FMD status . #% Persons involved in perpetrating any of these awful terrorist attacks which have taken place must be arrested and must be brought to justice , including terrorists operating in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad organisations . #% If we do not ensure that our systems can be brought together and work in an interoperable way , we are doomed to be less successful than continental blocs such as the United States . #% The European Union Social Fund is a key financial mechanism which has been used very effectively , particularly in Objective 1 regions , to provide new training opportunities for the unskilled . #% Will questions to the Commission - ostensibly due between 6.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. be taken ? #% I have to say that the Commission 's attitude to the matter has been appalling . #% For example , the complexity of transport flows offers some areas new opportunities yet other areas get congestion and pollution . #% The writing is on the wall . #% It is interesting to note that the differentiation in the banking sector 's involvement in film is not necessarily related to the country 's audiovisual output capacity . #% Biofuels will contribute to Europe 's energy self-sufficiency , at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia . #% I am satisfied that it does not interfere with Member States competences in the following domains : #% The only successful way to achieve implementation of any eventual discard ban will be through the involvement of the fishermen in monitoring and controlling and , above all , by peer pressure to ensure a level playing field . #% This House is not going to accept that once the glare of publicity leaves South-East Asia , the commitments we make now will not be met . #% My group would insist in the post-Laeken period on some convention-style method with deep involvement for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to include the active engagement of Council . #% We have been able to reach a very wide consensus in Parliament across political and national boundaries on the Sixth Framework Programme . #% Could the record show -- I know you can not go back and retake the vote -- that those Members who voted did so in error . #% From an Irish perspective , the Seville Summit was a most important one . #% The fact that insurance companies in the UK , Belgium and Germany are not competing in the Irish market was due , I felt , to a failure of the European Union to enforce the right of establishment and the right to equal access to the market . #% Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy , tell me this morning - because you have not done so yet - about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the Irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the Irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them . #% As regards costs , the Committee on Budgets added approximately EUR 400 million in horizontal cuts that the Council deducted from the budget so we added EUR 400 million this morning . #% We have had oceans since time immemorial , and this has nothing to do with our present problems with climate change , so I agree with my other colleagues and can not see what possible relevance that paragraph has . #% As I came here to speak tonight , the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider -- as is its duty -- the proposed change in the legal base in the common position . #% Minister Lowry must explain what the likely effect of the liberalization of gas markets will be on consumer prices . #% It is a fact that the forensic clean-up of the murder scene , the intimidation of witnesses , the offer by the IRA to murder the murderers and the refusal to cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland are politically motivated and can not be separated from the murder itself . #% The balance of advantage , or the balance of returns to Member States , is extremely difficult to calculate . #% Mr President , on 15 January about 40 000 indigenous people and small peasants lost their villages , provisions and fields . #% I remember that when the Berlin Wall came down an African leader lamented the fact that the European Union had now turned to the East like a man looking at a gorgeous new girl that had appeared and Africa was going to be forgotten and left on the shelf . #% Without using all of my time , because we may all be tired and perhaps emotional , I shall just say , with regard to the developing world -- and I share the concerns of others here in the House -- that in reforming sugar we have upset the developing world , because we are offering it access to our markets at much reduced prices . #% This was clearly demonstrated to us during our visit to the region , and our resolve to continue to encourage an agreement now between Bhutan and Nepal is as strong as ever . #% The highest priority must be given by the industry throughout the European Union to the attainment of best practice in line with stringent environmental guidelines and high standards of quality assurance , as is currently the case in Ireland . #% The Committee 's proposal aims to improve the quality of the capital base , and extend and strengthen the coverage of the capital framework . #% Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving R&D sector , we can not afford to wait until FP8 to take action . #% But it should be secondary to removing the disease and that was not the case and I criticise that particular scheme in that respect . #% Madam President , may I send my best wishes to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for a speedy recovery and thank her for her long-term interest in this important issue . #% 
Therefore , we have to make it quite clear that if there have to be changes in behaviour and technology they must be made or else there will be penalties . #% The EEAS represents yet another example of wasted taxpayer 's money , for a service my constituents do not want but have forced upon them by bureaucrats who seek to squeeze more and more power away from national governments towards the EU . #% Mr President , the reconstruction of Afghanistan has not , in my view , remotely begun , despite the assurances given in the House today . #% I have had to engage a lawyer to follow up the fact that this has not been dealt with responsibly over the last couple of years . #% The Commission communication ( of 1998 ) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights ` contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law ' . ' #% We should not be presented with invitations to sample something produced ... #% Mr President , in relation to the Minutes , has any progress been made by yourself and your offices in the matter of correspondence with a Member of this House who made charges of a serious criminal nature in respect of the buildings policy of the institution ? #% People must come first ! #% While I certainly support many of the comments contained in the report on the Small Business Act , I was very disappointed that the report that emerged from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy contained a paragraph calling for a common consolidated corporate tax base . #% As I have said on many previous occasions in this House , farmers are unfortunately the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I thank the rapporteurs for the tremendous amount of work they have done on these reports , coming , as we said in an earlier debate , at a very important time when people are looking for answers and looking for ideas on how to move forward . #% in writing . - I abstained on the vote on the Domenici report despite the vast majority of sensible proposals contained in it . #% I would like to see them . #% I also applaud the decision by the United States to sign the protocol . #% Indeed , the fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU . #% I had met representatives of the bread industry in Northern Ireland and was in doubt as to the intolerable and costly imposition which was involved . #% We have the great privilege in this House to be the representatives of the people of Europe . #% The EU Commission recognises the importance of this industry and the fact that certain agricultural products , including sugar , could be used for producing bioethanol . #% In this regard , I would like to refute the criticisms that have been made here by Mrs Carlsson and others in relation to the report . #% Mr President , I welcome this measure . #% However , giving an inch in terms of flexibility does not mean countries are allowed to take a mile in terms of widening fiscal deficits . #% The positive approach of a traditionally neutral country such as Austria to these developments is to be applauded and I urge all other neutral Member States , including my own , to follow their lead . #% If there is a hard landing in the construction industry ; it has implications for revenue ; it has implications for unemployment payments and therefore revenue ; it has implications for consumer confidence . #% It was the only equitable and honourable outcome . #% We , on the left in Ireland , will insist that it goes to a referendum of the Irish people before it is passed . #% However , the limitation of the 1994 directive was that as the number of accidents is fortunately very low , the opportunities to learn from them are very limited and lessons can , therefore , be drawn only after an accident has already happened . #% We must put pressure on these governments to make sure that they do not allow this to happen . #% There is a great threat to their fundamental rights . #% What I would say to the honourable Member is that both sides must work to respect minorities on the island so that we can respect each other 's traditions and bring about a lasting peace in which we do not threaten each other . #% Commissioner , will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal ? #% So there are lessons to be learned : set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem - three or four people - Ireland had 30 000 civil servants , and the Irish Civil Service won every time ! #% The UK authorities argue that in spite of ethical doubts the cloning of human embryos is necessary because it is the only way to help patients suffering from various diseases . #% The very existence of systems for the indiscriminate interception of communications is a violation of Article 6 of the EU Treaty , as the Commissioner himself has recognised . #% We should not throw staff , money or powers at an organisation just because problems exist . #% Given the ongoing difficulties in the agricultural sector , more resources are required . #% The budget totals of # 506bn will put in place various programmes to lay the foundation for the impending enlargement of the European Union itself . #% I can only say that I wish that Commissioner Byrne 's colleague , Mr Fischler , would demonstrate the same willingness to understand the difficulties currently faced by European farmers . #% The Commission 's first cohesion report outlines and highlights the problem of continuing regional disparities in unemployment . #% If we were unable to intervene and intervene promptly and properly in Kosovo , on our own doorstep , without weeks and months of prevarication and legal consultation to see what we could or could not do , how could we really expect the EU to respond as we would wish and the citizens of Europe would wish to the tragedy in East Timor ? #% Finally , I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner himself . #% Appointments of key new personnel in Europe to tackle international terrorism in Europe are to be welcomed , but we must remember that democracy is fragile and we must be strong in our efforts to promote the rule of law and protect democratic institutions . #% The reasons for this are twofold : the continued dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and his oppression of Iraq 's citizens and the continued imposition of sanctions of the most Draconian kind . #% By the way , Ireland also submitted its NAP on 13 July and you did not mention its name in the countries that you read out . #% I would like to go on record as saying that this , in my view , is the first serious attempt in a long time to take up the challenge of the need for change . #% It is totally inappropriate for the European Union to engage in this form of cooperation with Israel while that state continues to blatantly ignore international law and abuse the human rights of the Palestinian people . #% It is proposed in the financial perspective that Member States can increase the rate of modulation by up to 20 % . #% All security agencies in the EU countries , whether public or private , must fully cooperate one with the other in every way possible . #% Furthermore , according to the Treaties , any revision of the CAP will not take place before 2003 - 2004 . #% In conclusion , may I once again thank Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and the Commission . #% There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need . #% This protocol is designed to transfer capacity from the European Union to Latvia by making it easier to establish joint enterprises . #% I hope , in the context of Mr Evans ' report , there will be some way in which we can hear - preferably directly from the people who have been helped by this - precisely what the effect of the Tempus programme has been on their countries . #% We continue to have very serious problems with countries that have not signed the Hague Convention and where there are still a number of abduction cases . #% I am very surprised that she was working in an insurance company 30 years ago : I did not think she was that old , so she wears her age well . #% Overall , Parliament 's position is an improvement on the proposals from the Commission and the Council , but it does not go far enough . #% Greater involvement of fishermen and stakeholders in the management process is long overdue . #% In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life . #% I might add that threshold is one we would never have crossed if we had followed the soft advice of a false sense of confidence commended by some to this House last December . #% We are supposed to respect the precautionary principle in Europe , especially when we are talking about putting genetically-modified organisms into the environment , considering that , with GM , any resulting adverse effects may be irreversible . #% I have one or two concerns that perhaps represent my own views rather than those of my political group . #% In this report and in the Commission document , great importance is attached to the need for proper provision for social security and pensions for part-time workers . #% Medical treatments are certainly improving ; however , they are not inexpensive and one year ' s treatment for HIV illnesses costs an average of between IEP 12 000 - 14 000 . #% The Union first established contractual links with Albania in 1992 and in due course the Commission will submit a draft mandate to the Council for negotiations with Albania regarding a new bilateral agreement . #% A recent survey in Ireland showed that , while Irish freshwaters are still markedly less polluted than the European average , up to 30 % of river length has been contaminated by phosphates . #% Fuel cells , a technology of the future . #% In this context , I welcome the importance the rapporteur has given to culture in peaceful conflict resolution . #% 
A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed . #% Originally started in March 2000 by the Dutch Government and Dutch fishermen , the project was aimed at clearing the North Sea of litter , using fishing nets . #% This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and , as our rapporteur has pointed out , is high-risk . #% Parliament and the Commission are right to be adamant that the Union must improve its telecommunications network . #% If our buildings and , in particular , our houses were designed properly we could manage with hardly any heating or cooling equipment . #% The objective of the EPR is to make producers financially responsible for their products when these become waste so an upstream effect is created which leads to design for the environment , taking account of the durability , repairability or upgrading , disassembly or recycling of the product . #% If we are serious about achieving the objectives outlined in the Lisbon process then clearly not only do we need to increase our budget at European level , but we must also find ways to ensure that Member States actually address the issues seriously . #% The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome . #% Mr President , you will recall that during our last part-session in Strasbourg I raised the plight of the three hostages who were being held in Afghanistan . #% Firstly , I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties . #% I very much hope that the Middle East will resume peace talks in the near future . #% Obviously , this is of great concern . #% I have one amendment to my report and I ask the Commissioner to take it on board . #% I believe it is actually a waste of taxpayers ' money to challenge it because I think it is quite clear to anybody with an ounce of common sense that they are not entitled to this money . #% It is ironic to think that the same industries that are promoting this so-called chemical-free agriculture are the very same ones that have bombarded us with chemicals over the years and are making those crops reliant on chemicals in the future as well . #% For too long they have been the poor relation , particularly to the vast funds that the nuclear lobby has been able to access by fair means or foul , as I have already outlined . #% Mr President , in relation to the amendments , quite naturally I would support the thrust of the amendments which is the active decommissioning of all weapons held by terrorists on both sides of the divide . #% When you say that you can not prevent occasional shortcomings as regards freedom of the press , you have to ensure that it is prevented because Article F of the Maastricht Treaty states that the European Union shall respect the European Convention on Human Rights . #% It would be very dangerous indeed to concentrate simply on growth and competitiveness . #% Energy efficiency really is the key to meeting the promises that we made at Kyoto , particularly in the domestic sector . #% To do so would be to show contempt for the voice of the people , not just in Ireland , but throughout Europe . #% Though TB in its human form has been contained in most EU countries since the middle of the 20th century , it continues to spread aggressively among livestock and affects 5 % of cattle herds in my Ireland East constituency each year . #% - The Liberal Group today supported the amendment tabled by Jean Louis Bourlanges of the Group of the European People 's Party , which called for the resolution to be separate from the explanatory statement . #% However , nothing justified the subsequent acts of terrorism by either side , and in the current highly charged emotional situation , with the areas of conflict so widespread , it is very difficult to see a cease-fire emerging . #% The short tourist season is a real concern , with the need to spread the demand outside the high season and promote tourism products for different tastes , different interests , different seasons and different age groups . #% I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow . #% The ALTENER II Programme will work and can work in every Member State and of course , outside the European Union in applicant countries , for example , as well as in the Mediterranean countries where the potential is huge . #% I hope that you , Mrs Ashton , and Commissioner De Gucht , work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the United States , Haiti and elsewhere later this week . #% I look forward to the future . #% Returning Famagusta would be an excellent opportunity for Turkey to show not only the original inhabitants of Famagusta but also the EU and the rest of the world that it is a peace-loving and peace-supporting nation . #% I hope the Irish government will invest sufficient time in explaining the Treaty accurately and sincerely to all our citizens the second time around . #% National interests must be protected during this phase of negotiations as an overburdened bureaucracy at EU level is not the desired outcome from these IGC talks . #% Therefore , my group will be seeking separate votes on certain paragraphs , in particular within the Smet report . #% I support the agenda set by the EU leaders at their summit in Lisbon last year . #% I would specifically like an assurance from the President-in-Office that the key decisions will not be taken by the Irish presidency until we in Parliament have been given the chance to offer our own opinions . #% What we are paying for is an agriculture that is environmentally sound , guarantees the highest levels of food safety and traceability and upholds standards of animal welfare . #% It is very important to ask ourselves what precisely do we mean by weapons of mass destruction . #% author . - Mr President , I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up ! #% I believe that , with the amount of effort that various members of committees have put in , particularly my own committee , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , we have achieved that balance and I believe that this proposal should be acceptable to the House . #% If we want to talk about gender equality and demography , we need to talk about both genders being equally and fully responsible for rearing children . #% Just as you are responsive to us , we have to be responsive to those who elect us . #% At the moment we spend 1.11 % of Community GDP and we have written a great volume on the whole question of how we are to collect this money . #% I am entitled to my opinion , and so I repeat that this directive has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements . #% We have provided OLAF to further investigate suspected problems . #% The Hatzidakis report and the Commission proposals prove that the Jeremiahs who say that enlargement is bad news for UK regions have got it wrong . #% I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work , but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers . #% I refer of course to the fact that tonight my small country of Northern Ireland famously defeated the mighty football team of Spain at Windsor Park in Belfast . #% That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass . #% I would like to refer to three in particular . #% The draft recommendation leaves out a very important issue in that it fails to identify the threatened biodiversity of our coastal zones . #% Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report . #% I do not think it has done , and I do not think it did in the past what this Parliament asked it to do in 1990 . #% I just wanted to reply respectfully to our colleague who drew attention to the small attendance . #% I believe that it is imperative for Parliament to retain the power of codecision on strategic priorities , geographical and thematic aid programmes . #% Cooperation to tackle this problem is imperative . #% It is clear from the ethnic subjugation in the past few months that Milosevic has nothing but contempt for our studied , nuanced and impotent words of diplomacy . #% Risk communication will also be a key element . #% We want to help the Chinese to preserve Tibet , which has a unique cultural , religious and linguistic heritage . #% We could fill this hemicycle with reports of the accidents , leakages , damage to the environment , damage to human beings and damage to property caused by bad management , faulty construction and bad design of this type of Magnox plants . #% I want to state yet again , here in this House , that I am a friend of Islam . #% Little did I think 30 years down the road that nothing would have changed , and I hope the same happens to duty-free . #% That is how the plan seems to be evolving . #% I would point out that the European Commission and the European Parliament have held extensive consultations with the European automobile industry on these various matters , and it has voluntarily agreed to accept a timetable to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new cars by 25 % by the year 2008 . #% Why do we not bring that regulation forward immediately and not have our hands forced ? #% Mr President , it is now over fifteen years since the disease we all now know as AIDS came into the public domain . #% Mr President , congratulations to the rapporteur , who has achieved a quite remarkable level of consensus right across this House . #% 
I say this to them as a passionate `` yes '' voter , because they are causing more damage with the post-Nice referendum signals they are sending than with any pre-Nice referendum signals they sent in Ireland . #% We need a Treaty which will ensure that the European Union institutions can take decisions in a simplified and effective manner for many years to come . #% They must resist the temptation often to gold-plate or add on national requirements . #% You even went so far as to ask us for our opinion on different issues . #% We would suggest that this would allow this important subject to be examined in more detail , as , again , the timetable imposed was very short and did not afford Parliament the time it would have wanted on such an important subject . #% People are dying daily because they are caught up in a drug underworld which is making millions from their misery . #% I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism . #% Some injuries will happen - we can not prevent them all - but with better understanding of how they happen , resulting in safer products and practices , we can reduce their occurrence . #% Unfortunately this does not appear to be the case in Ireland regarding paid maternity leave , facilities for breastfeeding and exemption from night shifts . #% Those are the comments I wanted to make regarding those two reports . #% We know , obviously , that where they have been tried they have worked well - the tax differentials on leaded and unleaded petrol are a classic example . #% I am a strong supporter of the establishment of an EU defence policy because I believe it is as much a fundamental part of European integration as the single currency . #% I was against part two , but was in favour of part one . #% Zaire , as we know , is a by-word for exploitation and plunder . #% It does not bode well that we take the opportunity to play politics at this juncture . #% Amazingly enough , for all the issues that they brought up , they saw that the best way of getting a solution was at a European level -- not at a national level -- because they saw there was a bigger picture involved . #% It is also important that we avoid excessive horizontalism in an approach to this , and I believe that perhaps the first draft that we looked at the outset was excessively so . #% To assist , a UK Government scheme of grant aid was announced , with applications possible until the end of this month . #% This did not commence with the present structural funds programme because there was a delay in getting it off the ground , particularly in Ireland . #% I am sorry that because of the late hour there are not more people here to listen to the appalling statistics of deaths of young children , of mothers -- needless deaths from illnesses that we could cure so easily . #% We in Ireland have recently witnessed the demise of the Irish sugar industry . #% Most people subscribe to this in theory but not in practice . #% From an Irish perspective , agriculture and the associated food industry are central to our economy , and the chocolate industry , which is the subject of this debate , is a very important component . #% I should like to ask the Minister , in the spirit of Christmas , by wishing him well , if he does get that job at the airport , could he do something about direct flights to Strasbourg ? #% For the most part , we share the fundamental reason why the Convention was first established . #% Irish beef is known throughout Europe as a quality product . #% Madam President , I shall deal with two main points in this question of enlargement . #% The ELDR Group notes the implicit criticism of the Council in its role as one of the two arms of the budgetary authority for failing to give due and proper consideration to critical reports prepared by the European Court of Auditors on tourism policy on the MED and the ECHO Programmes . #% But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission ? #% There is considerable potential in rational use of energy ; if research into renewable energy had been funded at the same rate as nuclear energy has been over the last 40 years , we would be in a very different position . #% As I said at the outset , I doubt very much that anybody 12 months ago would have thought that we could have achieved what we did achieve . #% In this process particular emphasis will be placed on groups requiring special attention , such as young people seeking their first job , the long-term unemployed and unemployed women . #% It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it . #% This would have been particularly problematic in small Member States like Ireland where there are some naturally imposed restrictions on energy subdivisions due to the geographical isolation and the limited size of the population . #% Since the disappearance of the children and family budget line in DG V there is no budget line which has children as a general target group . #% We are due to hear in this debate from one of Sinn Féin / IRA 's representatives in this House . #% A notable case in Ireland recently has been the exposure of the Turkish multinational company Gama , which has deprived workers of earnings through paying substantially below the minimum wage and endangered their health and safety by requiring a substantial number of its workers to work up to 80 hours per week . #% Colleagues have indicated the rate at which WEEE is growing . #% I also believe that there should be an opportunity in the future for this House , through its own committees and the plenary , to debate the activities of Europol on an annual basis . #% This situation simply exploits workers , offers no protection , promotes xenophobia , and certainly fits the description of the ` race to the bottom ' . #% Equally , there are different concerns from the perspectives of different Member State governments within the Union . #% Mr President , I should like to ask for your advice . #% The coastal zone is one of the most dynamic areas of the earth ' s surface with an abundance of unique flora and fauna which need to be protected . #% There are those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is destined to fail as the rest of the world waits for those nations already taking part to fall short of their obligations and so provide the perfect cover for their decision not to participate in the first place . #% Mr President , we have been sleepwalking for decades . #% It is an awful pity that Parliament , the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland . #% The will of the Irish people must be respected . #% As far as we in Northern Ireland are concerned , we will not see any change unless we achieve a totally different approach from our planning services . #% I congratulate Mr Fiori . #% This is the fourth attempt . #% The problem as I see it is that everyone comes here to these debates and makes all the right statements , says all the right platitudes , but they are not prepared to take the tough decisions necessary to help those most in need . #% His report is a comprehensive one , which makes an important contribution to the debate on the evolving EU security policy as defined by the Maastricht Treaty and accepted at the time by all Member State governments . #% In any other region of this Union , if this had happened and 40 % of an industry had been destroyed something decisive would have been requested of the national government and undertaken . #% We must all ensure that we encourage Hamas to return to ceasefire talks with the Palestinian Prime Minister , Mahmood Abbas . #% In Ireland we have signed a bilateral agreement with Romania and Nigeria and we are planning to sign more such agreements in the future so that we can speed up the procedure of deportation . #% We need to facilitate cooperation between SMEs and research institutes , promoting IPR ( Intellectual Property Rights ) and technology transfer . #% There is no public acceptance either in my country or in many others of deep-level storage . #% This is a work in progress and the Commission will present a report every three years on the implementation of the initiative . #% It is not the same form of terrorism we have experienced in France , Ireland , Spain and elsewhere , by ETA and other terrorist organisations . #% Earlier , we spoke about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and how it can assist redundant workers in certain sectors . #% We must provide young people with access to lifelong learning and to courses with practical training elements to enable them to take up these jobs and to grow and progress in their careers . #% If dialogue is to succeed , both sides must be open . #% Following the conclusions of the Belgian informal meeting in October , the Commission must now undertake a review of the operation of state aids and regional regeneration policy . #% When we speak of social inclusion as part of EU social policy , we need to ensure that , by our actions , social inclusion is integral to the decisions we take , and this programme has social inclusion written all over it . #% When I saw this letter to Mr Howard , I have to say I was absolutely horrified and so were other Members of the European Parliament to whom I showed it . #% The Commission 's proposal allows for a series of exceptions from organic production rules , such as the case of setting up organic farms or solving livestock management problems . #% 
Application to see the complete list of reviewers is refused . #% Fewer and fewer people are attracted to farming as a way of life , particularly when more rewarding work is available elsewhere . #% Only through slow and painful negotiations with compromises can that occur , only then can the Israelis and Palestinians be secure in their own states . #% Is the Council discussing this issue ? #% This is an economic issue - ensuring that pupils , when they enter the labour market , are capable of participating in it . #% I hope this kind of support will maintain this very important committee . #% Please single out health services , consider the benchmark of good regulation , and deal with this specific area in a more appropriate way . #% As far as my own personal position is concerned , I have voted in accordance with my own conscience , which is that I am opposed to abortion . #% This happens in many instances . #% It is interesting to note that in 1995 , following the unilateral termination by Morocco of the fisheries agreement concluded in May 1992 for a period of four years and in view of the likely problems of negotiating a new agreement with Morocco , the Commission initiated negotiations with third countries so that vessels prevented from fishing as a result of any loss of fishing opportunities off Morocco could , if necessary , be moved elsewhere . #% The debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process . #% The current UN Conventions set out clear guidelines for all countries to apply their own national law and enforcement procedures . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I hope that we are on the way to a first reading agreement . #% Arising from the reply from the President-in-Office , would he consider requesting a proposal from the Commission on this important matter ? #% We are elected legislators . #% This directive must ensure genuine universal access and extend to all users , especially those with special social needs , those on low incomes and those with disabilities . #% Can we keep them there ? #% The products of aquaculture speak for themselves , and it is wild fish stocks that we should be looking at and addressing here . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as in a limited way it takes a step in the direction of tackling the current lack of transparency in relation to export credits and in tackling the massive gap between the stated objectives of the EU and the reality of how export credits are used in the EU . #% For some time now , I have been calling for the exclusion of agriculture from these talks . #% I fear that the proposals will come to nothing without a change of mind by several Member States , my own of course included . #% When we vote tomorrow , the EUR 14.8 million will represent a hand-up and not a hand-out to over 2 400 people to help them restart their lives . #% But be warned , Parliament will not accept any old outcome . #% Two deadlines have been missed already , and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing . #% In my view true diplomacy , by opening and keeping open channels , is our best hope of advancing our views in relation to dealing with these problems . #% I believe that the Commission must answer to this and tell us what they are going to do . #% We now have the tools , for example the SWIFT clearing system in Europe , which would enable us to apply a tax . #% We know the European Union has already accepted natural monopolies in certain service areas such as gas , electricity and air traffic control to ensure fair access to all users in the single market . #% We need to ensure that education is fully integrated and allows people with disabilities not to be segregated , but to be educated along with everyone else . #% Animal welfare was perceived by poor countries as a rich person 's interest which , to some of them , was almost obscene where we are confronted with starving people . #% This will be important to us . #% As I said , 2 500 Irish schoolteachers undertook development programmes in the past year . #% The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change , but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the world 's environment and we are doing it on a daily basis : greenhouse gas emission levels , for example , are being ignored by many EU countries , including , sadly , my own country . #% However , some vessels fishing down there are European vessels flying other flags and established under joint ventures . #% I wish that they would take into consideration the international aspects of this in relation to the immense social and environmental problems that will be caused . #% Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased . #% There are currently 13 companies in Ireland , mostly from the accommodation sector , that are Ecolabelled but we need to encourage further participation . #% A Europe built on sovereign states trading and cooperating for mutual benefit , and not for the unworkable , unwanted ever-closer union , has some hope of success . #% I would ask the Commission to provide an outline of proposals it intends to submit on halting Internet abuse . #% And why are transport workers and childcare workers excluded ? #% In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000 . #% This is yet again , an outlandish attack on the CAP which has served us well . #% It would be unfortunate if , in the end , we were bounced into ill-thought-out or ill-conceived solutions without due reflection and debate because this will be crucial to our effective ability to cope with enlargement - a point , again , which the Taoiseach quite correctly emphasized as the next major challenge beyond the IGC . #% I wish to report to this House that last week four hundred workers who took part in a legally called strike were summarily dismissed by that company . #% If there is any thing we should do while we still have power and influence in the world , while we still have riches beyond the dreams of the vast majority of people who live on this earth ; if there is any objective we could set ourselves which would be a historic achievement for a united Europe , it is to help along the less fortunate peoples of the world . #% Does he regard the committee whose advice he rejects as incompetent , unable to judge what is good for animals or dangerous for human health ? #% The importance of education can not be underlined enough . #% I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve . #% These appliances are often wrongly connected by householders to surface-water drains leading directly to rivers rather than to so-called foul drains , which channel the run-off to water treatment plants , thereby causing unnecessary pollution in water courses . #% On the question of defence , we warmly welcome the establishment of the rapid reaction force and its significant and necessary progress - Kosovo has taught us dearly the need for that . #% We need quite complex discussions on energy in the event of any sort of restructuring , which may well be an interesting idea . #% This is particularly sad because a document that deals with the amount of hours someone works in a week applies to them more than any other group of workers in the EU . #% Membership of the European Union has brought enormous benefits to Ireland . #% We have the Birds Directive , the Habitats Directive , the common agricultural policy , the common fisheries policy , the structural funds , 18 000 Natura 2000 sites , plus a network , and yet we have no joined-up thinking in relation to this issue . #% Mr President , the notion of EU citizenship is really a synthetic concoction ; it is not a natural product . #% It is all very well changing what you call them , but if you do not change the approach there is very little to get excited about . #% If we here tomorrow decide to add patentability to software , programmers all over Europe might be breaking the law without even knowing they were doing so until it was too late . #% Mr President , I wish to make just two short points concerning the avian flu situation . #% They will be quite happy to have their tax money used to ensure that the political system remains uncorrupted or becomes corruption-free . #% It is totally incorrect and wrong that we participate in those kind of votes . #% Without clear objectives and a programme of work , this muddled policy will continue to fail the most vulnerable in the region . #% We have to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve and whose fears we are trying to allay . #% Let us be clear about one thing . #% Subject to that , the Liberal Group supports the timetable set out by the Commission . #% In other words , they failed to answer the question . #% Rejection may not be palatable , but it must be faced . #% 
Air traffic management in Europe is fragmented and the current system is not able to keep pace with the demand , which results in delays in many flights . #% Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges by improving research into the causes , their transmission and prevention , as well as health information and education . #% This must change ! #% Madam President , I apologise to you and to colleagues if by rising I test their patience , but since you have indulged some others , I should like to express a very brief view . #% I would ask the President-in-Office if he is willing to have this matter examined , if not by the Council , by the Commission or indeed the European Central Bank . #% Industry must be given long-term certainty . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Daul , on his work , which I have no difficulty in supporting on behalf of my group . #% There has been a radical shift in agricultural activity , brought about by the agricultural reforms of 2003 , and the opening-up of markets as a result of the WTO . #% The European Union , in line with the commitment entered into in the Amsterdam Treaty , must become an area of freedom , security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety . #% . I wish to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , for their presentations . #% Structural funding in Ireland , however , will not come to a sudden halt at the end of 1999 . #% The option , therefore , of vaccination has to be kept open in the interests of the wider community . #% As our beef industry is worth over # 50 million per year , agriculture is our biggest industry . #% We in Northern Ireland have problems . #% I thank Mr Provan for his report , which is a fair representation of the almost unanimous opinion of the Fisheries Committee . #% In addition , the legal basis for Community action to combat social exclusion is a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference . #% The fifth framework programme looks promising . #% Mr President , I too want to congratulate Louise McVay and indeed the rapporteur , Mrs Aaltonen , for bringing forward this report from the Committee on Petitions . #% The depletion of oil stocks means that fertilisers , pesticides and machinery will all be affected in due course and , by extension , agriculture will be affected and will have to adapt . #% Yesterday , listening to Commissioner Monti , I became convinced by his reassurances that the ethics committee in relation to biotechnology will be a serious one with which we as a Parliament can interact on a regular basis . #% Throughout the summer months we in Ireland have witnessed the direct impact of the importation of cheap Brazilian beef into the market . #% If you decide to be your own man , to be political , then you will do us all a great favour . #% By investing more of our resources into giving real education and real training to our people then we can guarantee that they will benefit from the huge explosion in job creation opportunities which will be presented . #% Domestic violence aims to control and destroy the human spirit . #% I agree with the rapporteur that much of the problem is linked to the gap between free market conditions we now enjoy and the lack of harmonisation of rules on working conditions . #% Through good practices of coastal zone management , we should work towards sustainable management of the coastal zone . #% I think it is time we dispelled this perception because Europe , in fact , is now the main contributor to both of these programmes . #% The basis for the European convergence model must be the successful tax regimes rather than the ones that are creating difficulties . #% My second point is that , in addition to the evident problem of slow manufacturing processes , it appears unlikely that there will be enough flu shots available for all those who might need them . #% The second challenge is to help rebuild Lebanon after the devastation of the summer . #% We need to be able to hold on to our best researchers and innovators . #% These amendments allow EU funding for unethical use of existing embryonic stem cell lines created before 31 December 2003 . #% During our two hours on board , it was clear to us that neither the Belgian health authorities nor the airline concerned , British Midland , had the faintest idea what to do in such an eventuality . #% However , the terms of the analysis that has been carried out must be broadened to consider the very important social consequences of what is essentially a unique social service . #% But over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission . #% This is particularly true of the peripheral countries such as Ireland , Greece , Spain and Portugal , where communities that would have disappeared have been supported and maintained , if not for ever , certainly until a change in economic environment , until the new technologies arrived . #% If the rates are increased , as I hope , we must ensure that ample money is allocated to axes 3 and 4 , as well as 1 and 2 . #% I should like to be reassured by the Commission that the failure to establish paying agencies for Sapard in so many states for reasons which I understand will not mitigate against the carryover of funding that we have dedicated for structural agricultural reform . #% Can the Commissioner comment on the validity and logic of a policy that compels Member States to radically reduce emissions with resulting increases in EU energy prices and lower manufacturing output while , at the same time , we promote trade with and production in China , the world 's greatest polluter , with no enforceable requirements for the suppression of emissions from them . #% It is very hard to know what is happening when licences are granted to 70 or 80 vessels to catch such a small amount of fish . #% We want an end to the tyranny that has been perpetrated on the people of East Timor for the last 25 years with the help of EU countries , America and all these hypocritical people who want to sell arms to tyrants in Indonesia and other countries around the world . #% Like previous speakers , I welcome it because it is time that we in the EU had our own domain . #% I appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to lay down a negotiated settlement based on existing agreements . #% I would like to cross-examine the Commissioner on this report , on the implications of duty-free for jobs . #% Is the Minister aware of China 's activities in the developing world ? #% We need to return again to people and their value as the central issue . #% Furthermore , I think it is an excellent idea that Member States be encouraged to apply fiscal incentives for passenger cars , in order to encourage the placing on the market of cars and vehicles that meet energy-saving and energy efficiency requirements . #% However , be that as it may , the matter of transport in particular impacts very much on the general public . #% How can you regard this as cooperation ? #% It probably has a better chance of success in addressing wider policy issues , like transport environment or economic policy questions , than for example the CO2 tax , which has not really managed to take off and generate the appropriate consensus . #% Unfortunately , as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy , we can but mourn the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him . #% Whilst I am also grateful to the Council and the Commission , I regret that the British and Irish governments did not ask for a higher sum of money . #% Mr President , the details of the European Constitution are extremely important . #% European Union leaders confronted these new challenges with vigour and determination and we are all collectively intent on tackling the scourge of terrorism . #% I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record . #% In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party , the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success . #% This directive , which will now be enacted uniformly across the European Union , will ensure that cars will be disposed of in the future in a more environmentally friendly manner . #% For our part , the Liberal group has consistently argued the merits of individual accountability within collegiality . #% It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report , because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered . #% There are very few people in any of our countries who have not themselves been the victims of criminal acts or whose families have not been affected by crime one way or another . #% The total cost loss to the UK last year was GBP300 million , an increase of 55 % on 1999 . #% Many of my colleagues have said to me - without anticipating the outcome of that work - that , should we ultimately need to review our framework in the light of any emerging trends in this regulation , the Commission President , Mr Prodi , should declare on the record , before the vote , that the Commission will be open to the idea of reviewing the document in the light of any evolving policy on transparency . #% However , I urge that sanctions be introduced to ensure that , on its adoption , this directive will be implemented effectively . #% I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , for his hard work and the close contact he has maintained with both the Presidency-in-Office and the Commission in an effort to find a way forward and - given the critical deadline of 1 April - to prevent a legislative vacuum from occurring . #% It is extremely difficult to project how the economies of the 15 members will go , how the cost of the CAP will go , how the applicant countries will go over the next five to eight years . #% If the truth be told , however , in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on . #% 
I seriously question that point . #% I want to say a special thank you to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for the commitment he has shown on this issue , both as a former chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , a Vice-President of our Parliament and someone who has keenly followed these issues from the beginning of the peace process . #% I should like , on behalf of my PPE-DE Group colleagues and , I suspect , all colleagues , to be treated on a par with both the European Commission and the Council delegates who will be there . #% I appeal to the House to make creative use of the possibility open to us , in setting our agenda , to recognise this substantive political requirement and to facilitate a debate at 3 p.m. and a vote at 6 p.m. or thereafter this evening . #% The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers . #% Mr President , there has been a lot of criticism here this morning about the fact that contracts have been awarded to Korean companies and the damage that this has done to the European industries . #% Finally , I urge you to take up the issue of debt cancellation for developing countries . #% It condemns all acts of violence and intimidation which are preventing civilians from leaving the conflict area . #% It will certainly consolidate democratic structures in Europe , while at the same time strengthening the economy of an expanding European Union . #% I am glad also to hear what she had to say about the annual action programmes because we really do need to deliver on the letter that Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and Commissioner Michel sent to Mrs Morgantini and myself as rapporteur on the DCI , because in that letter it was clear that Parliament would decide for itself what structures it would set up and the programmes and strategy papers it would examine . #% Mr President , I suppose it is true to say that a lot of what needs to be said has already been said in this debate but I think it is important that as many people as possible should participate in this debate . #% I support this , but I would strongly suggest that we incorporate into the wording of point 3 that first and foremost , the Union will support the family as the primary and natural educator and protector of the child as is their duty . #% We have refused urgent treatment for the other two proposals . #% We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear , appropriate and speedy legislation . #% Furthermore , it is a labour-intensive industry and , as such , provides employment for a wide range of people . #% Quite obviously the profitable areas are needed to support the non-profitable areas , otherwise the postal system , as we know it , collapses . #% This is a very serious business for the European Parliament . #% I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it . #% That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or , to some extent , in the rest of Europe . #% I have to retire owing to health reasons , but I want to express my deepest gratitude to my colleagues in this Parliament , and of course to the Commission and the Council , for the outstanding support that they gave to peace in Northern Ireland . #% Realistically , I do not think there can be a mighty leap forward in the six months of this presidency . #% The vast majority of people agree that the European Union must change the procedures it uses if it is to become a more effective political body in a Community of 25 Member States . #% The numbers of patients will be far in excess of the doctors available , who are mostly male . #% I believe that it is only by pressure that we will make progress . #% They have a real problem servicing this debt . #% That will help to prevent the recurrence of such acts as the murder of Robert McCartney . #% On my recent visit to Iraq I saw children die of respiratory infections , diarrhoea , leukaemia , gastro-enteritis and malnutrition . #% That is a key and defining question which arises from Turkey 's application for EU membership . #% The applicant countries will also be confronted with a difficult process of adaptation in many areas ; for instance , justice and home affairs issues are central to the enlargement process . #% In 1986 we saw the beginning of a terrible tragedy with the explosion of reactor 4 . #% Resistance is still being dealt with by brutal military response . #% Those powers are clearly delineated between the institutions and the Parliament as a whole . #% As we move to another year , let me thank the secretariat of the committee , the group staff and my own staff for their assistance in this report . #% Their failure to give themselves up for justice endangers the reputation of Sinn Féin and of its leadership . #% Mr President , Ireland is the only country in Europe in which driftnet fishing of wild Atlantic salmon is allowed . #% They need regional structures with real development power , real decision-making powers for the regions . #% If tachograph legislation could be rigorously applied would we need the amendment before us , would we need to double the lorries and trucks on the road with the consequent environmental impact ? #% Military dictatorship continues to rule by force , despite recent ceasefire talks and agreements . #% It is not necessary , for example , for this text to complain about the policies which are not in the new treaty . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office . #% British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up . #% To conclude , those outcomes will not happen of their own accord . #% The President-in-Office has said that they are only allegations but there is a lot of information and data to back them up . #% In the end I decided to support it , but I have major problems because the expenses issue is not separated from the salaries issue . #% We read of horrors of the past regimes of Pol Pot and Stalin and it haunts me to think that the same situation exists in North Korea today . #% This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants . #% So an initiative like this will be virtually meaningless unless the Commission is able to persuade the Irish authorities to reduce the vehicle registration tax . #% While I can not say that it will never happen again , I can say that finally the veil of secrecy has been lifted . #% I fully welcome the initiative taken by my government which has commissioned a study into the possible use of new , alternative forms of waste management and disposal . #% I believe that over the coming months we have a role to play in this Parliament , along with the Council and the Commission , to rebuild that relationship . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I very much appreciate the comments and the content of the Commissioner 's response here this evening . #% Mr President , yesterday I tried to raise the issue of Roisín McAliskey and her continued detention in a secure psychiatric unit in England . #% I support the right of the Palestinian people to form a state , but one which comes about on the basis of negotiation and goodwill of all interested parties and not one which is brought about as a result of coercion . #% Sadly , it is also capable of causing grave disappointment when such qualities are absent . #% All countries with any involvement in the fishing industry - such as catching the fish , owning or crewing vessels , providing harbours , buying the final product - must participate . #% As a result of the decisions taken at the Copenhagen Summit last December , accession treaties for the new Member States joining the Union are to be signed on 16 April . #% It is a political question about European solidarity with Member States such as Denmark and Holland and not in fact , strictly speaking , about human rights in China at all . #% Precarious work is not only a major cause of the gender pay gap between women and men , but also creates an obstacle to career prospects leading to better jobs and professional development , trapping many in low paid insecure work . #% Intimidation and the capacity to impose its will through fear has always been as vital a weapon to the IRA as its guns and its bombs . #% This is the problem - the women who are here at the moment in this Parliament - the women who have actually achieved - who have got somewhere - are much better than the vast majority of men . #% I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on the motion on Uzbekistan . #% Irish aggregate farm income increased by 2.2 % in 2003 to EUR 2.524 billion , and estimated direct payments of EUR 1.6 billion accounted for 64 % of this figure . #% Size control should also be a ` must ' when we consider the design of an effective control policy . #% One of the central elements of this investment relates to ensuring that new broadband facilities are available at every opportunity . #% They are for the benefit of business and profit and the consumer is hoodwinked which is completely unjust . #% The hypocrisy of those amendments should be exposed so that Members are absolutely clear on what they are voting . #% 
Why , Taoiseach , has your government destroyed our sugar industry for an EU scheme , when Irish agriculture is struggling for survival and when we need biofuels like ethanol ? #% However , it must be said that there is no doubt whatsoever that , without political will , nothing will change . #% Chad : #% There are even examples of shipowners being funded by the FIFG to export to flag of convenience countries . #% Perhaps he could suggest ways of improving that , especially in the months ahead when , near Christmas , we decide what the TACs and quotas are for those areas and are bound to face grave difficulties . #% If we do not do that , it will be at our own peril . #% This is a very serious matter and one which the presidency takes very seriously . #% The report on substitution calls for the introduction of substitution policies for certain product categories . #% Mr President , in the last Parliament MEPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the EU appointing an Aids ambassador/envoy . #% Many of the proposals in Mr Mann 's report and some of the amendments will help towards this final goal . #% I predict that in ten years ' time - say , at the end of the next programme - instead of the seven million farmers we have today , we will probably have four million farmers , and yet we will be spending more money . #% I strongly support this political objective . #% There is no border to prevent our contact and cooperation . #% We have not calculated the cost of that decommissioning in the correct place , and it is currently , completely irregularly , being put into a research budget . #% We have an obligation as legislators to create a legal framework that bolsters the confidence of our consumers in the food they buy and eat . #% The decision by the United Kingdom and Ireland to opt out -- although in our case this was for unavoidable reasons because of the UK position -- did not prevent this from happening . #% Mr President , on the Northern Ireland Peace II agreement , as you are probably aware , the Council has asked the Commission to come forward with proposals for an extension of this programme for a further two years from 2004 to 2006 . #% However , EU programmes need tighter coordination to ensure that EU Aids initiatives are producing optimal results . #% This plunder must stop . #% I very much regret that Parliament is not being asked to vote directly on the contents of the treaty but instead , is being asked to consider the merits of a lengthy opinion from the Committee on Institutional Affairs . #% In addition , could he indicate how we can discourage the major sports companies which sell sports shoes and clothing at inflated prices in European stores ? #% Commissioner , do you deny that you made such a statement ? #% The fact of the matter is that we need to reduce the level of greenhouse gases that are being produced in Europe and in the United States . #% Any actors seeking to influence decision making and policy implementation at a European level are expected to join the common register , which will make both registration and access to information about lobbyists easier . #% Such central contact points will explain to consumers to whom they may address their complaints and seek appropriate redress . #% The transport must be authorised by the competent authorities , but they must be contactable 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . #% This is of such fundamental importance to European citizens that regrettably this has prevented me from voting in favour of this report . #% Despite what people may say about advances in technology or the new safety measures that have been put in place , the risks associated with nuclear energy are so vast and so great . #% I can not deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts . #% I very much welcome the Spanish Government 's objective of promoting more police cooperation across the borders of the Union . #% Also under discussion , although not in this plenary session , is the renewal of the multi-annual guidance programme , which has also been stalled due to the Council 's inability to make a decision . #% Finally , as my Liberal colleague said , we need to have a differential VAT regime to allow for employment creation and employment growth , in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises . #% On the other hand , these people could become our trading partners . #% I believe this directive is an unacceptable assault on the right of citizens to choose how they look after their health and well-being . #% We must have joined-up thinking , and there must be references in this directive to those areas which may be covered by other directives but which must also be mentioned here . #% I believe that the greatest problem for the European Union -- and perhaps it should reflect upon the two ` no ' votes in France and the Netherlands -- is that we try to make the one suit fit everyone , from one end of the Union to the other . #% The EU has a responsibility . #% We must ensure that they are doing what the MAGP intends they do in the long run . #% The motion clearly sets out what we believe the government of Nigeria must do , in accordance with its international obligations and the requirements of its own federal constitution . #% Mr President , I support the enlargement of the European Union because I know it will consolidate the new democracies in eastern and central Europe . #% Appropriate targets have to be put in place to guarantee the delivery of proper results rather than a mere tinkering with figures . #% Ships carry over 70 % of all trade between the Community and the rest of the world . #% We have a responsibility to play our part in ensuring that there is a smooth transition to the Sixth Programme . #% There is a danger in going out to the citizens of the European Union and saying to them that Maastricht was about unemployment , the single currency is about unemployment and then saying - if we fail - that Europe has failed us and let us down . #% The continuity of farming as a sustainable career for new entrants has again been brought into focus . #% It is absolutely ridiculous and it has to end . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs , especially Mr Blak for his hard work on this report . #% I totally refute what my colleague Mr De Rossa said here today . #% That requires more urgency before we move on to the direct tax agenda . #% in writing . - I wish to record that I support this report on agreement between the EU and Russia on cooperation in science and technology . #% Parliament should ensure that children are more visible in budget lines and the Commission should improve its technique and develop mechanisms for dialogue with the NGOs representing children . #% As European consumers it is our right to be able to buy bananas from those areas which represent good value for money and which reflect the democratic rights and good social standards that we expect and promote in those countries . #% Secondly , there are obviously going to be carry-over issues from one year to the next on which agreement has yet to be reached . #% May I tell the experts that Mr Chichester has mentioned , who say the industry is highly regulated , that the Titanic was the most highly regulated ship in the world and it sank . #% However , according to many reports which I have read on this issue , RDAs are set far too low and should be revised upwards . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council , as well as the Vice-President of the Commission , for their presentations and contributions . #% A fully operational Europol is critical to ensuring successful cooperation in the area of justice and home affairs . #% Furthermore , no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women . #% We gave market access guarantees which we lived up to in the EU and in return we got no market guarantees . #% Last year 390 000 people applied for asylum in the European Union . #% Most of these young people go to a very early grave . #% While I support voluntary commitments in general , if they are not seen to be effective then the European Union governments and institutions will have no option other than to legislate on this matter . #% One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing . #% For example , Mr Tappin , I would point out that a small road building contractor in Ireland that wins small-scale contracts from local authorities would find it absolutely impossible to bid for larger-scale construction projects for major roadways or motorways because it could not afford the investment required for the quantity of equipment needed to complete the job . #% They want to know exactly what the roles of a likely European Union Foreign Minister , and a possible President of the European Council , will be . #% They must take it on the head for failing to defend their products . #% 
To do this would be to offer some sort of an incentive to those countries not to participate in monetary union if they have strong currencies and are eligible to do so . #% This report talks about supporting the Franco-British Declaration at St. Malo and also of the speedy integration of the Western European Union into the EU . #% The Euratom Treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need . #% Therefore , because the constitution was a different constitution , it is not a precedent with regard to the issue of a competent authority to transmit such a request . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Girão Pereira for his report and to say that I support this deal made on behalf of European fishermen . #% I sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved . #% I wish to note also that the Irish Labour Party does not support a CCCTB . #% They too stand exposed as the grubby gangsters that they are . #% Emphasis , in the future , must be put on quality , while in my time limitless quantities were needed . #% That is why this matter is of exceptional political importance this week . #% So far , we have only the vaguest outline of what that might represent . #% Professionals more qualified than I have proven that this is not so . #% Farmers and sheep farmers in Ireland have always made the point that the sheepmeat regime does not create common conditions throughout the European Union . #% My Group was not in favour of this invitation , and , as I understand it , neither was the ELDR Group nor the GUE/NGL Group . #% Instead there is the positive recognition that we have an obligation to assist the fledgling democracies in the former communist countries . #% If we take municipal waste for example , what we produce is far in excess of the targets set in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme . #% It is not that the European Union does not have a stick , it simply refuses to even wave the stick , never mind use it . #% That must be the underlying basis of our strategies with regard to the quality of jobs , work and employment opportunities available - the kinds of skills that we give to people . #% I believe that we should include in the discussion not only purely budgetary matters but also the many additional factors which are also relevant to Agenda 2000 and the process of enlargement . #% I see my vote today as a support for not only maintaining existing water-borne freight traffic , but also for moving it from road to water . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for the support they have given to this report . #% At the moment they only label 50 % of their beef , yet they want to insist on compulsory labelling under category for all of us . #% Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans can not discard the social and economic consequences which they may have . #% We need to see that a fair and democratic procedure takes place in Western Sahara , that people have the right to vote freely . #% Recycling the Luxembourg guidelines grandiosely as an employment pact will make no difference to Europe 's unemployed . #% It is therefore important that any further negotiations or any intent to change difficult compromises are made in as open a forum as possible . #% I call on them to take the long-term view - to accede to the Commission 's proposals which also reflect the wishes of this house and indeed of the Vienna European Council . #% The long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority . #% Continued inaction will eventually cost us up to one fifth of our annual gross domestic product , but real action will mean a 1 % spend . #% In exchange , they are obliged to adopt all EU legislation related to the single market except those pieces of legislation that relate to agriculture and fisheries . #% I know the Commissioner believes very strongly in rural development and , indeed , believes that it is the future for agriculture policy , a view shared by the OECD . #% That certainly is not my intention . #% Mr President , I join in the compliments to the rapporteur for her dedication . #% We must know who they are . #% Mr President , the Community budget is the blood supply to a sustainable common agricultural policy . #% I think it would be wrong for the Commission to portray itself purely in the guise of the terrible enforcer against the Member States , because sometimes there are mistakes and errors within the legislation which must be corrected , and flexibility is required to achieve this . #% Many lessons can be learned from the way in which tuna fishing is managed . #% As one of the terms of EU membership , each state surrenders control of trade policy to Brussels so that no Member State can independently negotiate trade agreements with any country anywhere in the world . #% Isolation in Europe would only bring economic uncertainty to our country , which has a high level of inward investment comprising hundreds of thousands of jobs . #% Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people , but of the broader international community . #% We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future . #% Some prevention , and some stopping . #% Will we know what to do to avoid a repetition of the demoralising experience of a foot-and-mouth epidemic out of control ? #% I am pleased to see that businesses recognise that consumer confidence is critical to the growth of this small-business e-commerce network . #% It is quite clear that if this industry keeps growing as it is , it will soon outstrip the supply of resources from industrial fishing . #% Mr President , I , like everybody else , or perhaps most other people in this House , want a single market . #% I also agree with Mr Clegg that accession countries should be looked at . #% We propose to double the spending on science and society . #% As you will know , in a rather complex procedure , Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself . #% I think it is entirely unfair to deny this House the information to which it is entitled , and you face the real risk of being brought before the European Court of Justice if you do not provide it . #% All you need to do is swop McCarthy and Hatzidakis with Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and then we can follow on logically . #% But make no mistake : it is part of a grand design for an integrated and EU-controlled criminal justice system requiring , of necessity , the subservience of national systems . #% China has made great economic progress in recent decades and it is now a major player on the world stage , which delights us all . #% Mr President , the European Union and the Member States must work closely together and liaise with Europe 's motor and oil industries at all times so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future . #% I welcome the decision to allow Greece full participation within the single currency . #% It is not enough to contain terrorism , although I have no doubt of the power of our states to do so . #% Included within this process must be the efficient working of the codecision procedure , which covers the enactment of EU legislation across 38 different economic and social sectors of our society . #% He also failed to mention or to give a view on the question whether there ought to be a moratorium on these weapons . #% He , like myself , has been given the great problem of trying to deal with a highly technical report and trying to find a way through . #% They are one of the few remaining governing bodies anywhere in Europe where decisions are taken behind closed doors , and this must stop . #% This house and our colleagues in the European Council and Commission should begin to consider state funding to cover the proposed security costs , particularly in the event of a low passenger threshold not being passed . #% Unfortunately we do not have to vote on these issues at this stage . #% Does he agree with her statement last week that if we accepted the G20 proposals in their entirety we would lose up to half a million jobs in the supply chain , with beef production in the likes of Ireland and France being wiped out and poultry production disappearing altogether ? #% I believe , in the light of the spirit of cooperation and determination that prevails at this moment , that an agreement can be reached at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of the European Union governments . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , the negotiations for the EU-Canada trade agreement have been driven by major European and Canadian multinationals who want market access to vital public services so that they can profit at the expense of workers and consumers . #% What is the situation , because if , for example , a request for a roll call has been made , other groups do not actually make a request so the opportunity to hold a roll-call vote on the final report is denied us ? #% 
The programme has four objectives , all of which are indeed intelligent : the promotion of renewable energy sources , of energy efficiency , of clean transport and of all these three things in developing countries . #% There is a need to revise the regulation of the EGF to enable greater flexibility in the use of the resources provided , particularly with regard to the timeframe . #% There was torture , murder , imprisonment , kidnapping , coercion and blackmail , affecting people in Chile and in our countries . #% I would like to express , in this my final moment in Parliament , my deep appreciation to Parliament , the Commission and all the institutions , and also to my country for having given me the privilege of having a ringside seat at some of the most momentous political occasions of the last hundred years . #% Farming is perhaps the industry in the most precarious position in the European Union at present . #% This concept originated in the US in 1957 as a method of investigating the non-military uses of nuclear explosives . #% Regarding safety , the draft directive claimed that it would introduce common safety standards , but this directive , as drafted , does not set out those safety standards . #% From an Irish perspective , we should assist in humanitarian missions to the region . #% Finally , I would appeal to professional planners to use their common sense by taking account of the views of public representatives and community groups . #% But a nuclear future for Sellafield can be justified : not mixed oxide fuel production , not thermal oxide reprocessing at the MOX and THORP plants . #% Most reputable shopping sites ensure that money is not taken from an account . #% I will ensure that it is brought to the attention of the president of Ecofin as a matter of course . #% The future instrument must ensure better integration of environmental and climate change issues in developing cooperation . #% I ask that the present derogation be maintained to allow time to implement these changes remembering that , should an EU-rail operator wish to enter the Irish rail market , the derogation would immediately cease . #% Accident victims with very severe injuries such as paraplegia would not receive sufficient cover with a maximum sum of EUR 1 million . #% As for reducing journey times and stocking densities , I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion , because this debate has been too much guided by emotion . #% Member States must take their own commitments in these areas seriously . #% I propose today that some financial reserve be provided within the agricultural budget to address such emergency eventualities when they occur . #% In addition , the traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions and disasters that have occurred in EU waters points to the need for more effective coordination in avoiding potential maritime disasters . #% I do not think that the EU has taken Alzheimer 's disease seriously . #% Alongside this threat , we do not have clarity as to who actually owns the sugar quota ; I think it is essential that the quota be vested in growers of beet . #% I was one of the 200 parliamentarians who participated in the Convention and produced the Convention text , which the IGC subsequently took on board to a very large degree . #% But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders , deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade . #% Mr President , Mr Posselt , we have to accept our responsibilities to ensure that the credibility of Parliament is defended in relation to human rights and humanitarian norms . #% Those of us who participated in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty had hoped that Europol would be the agency which would provide national authorities with the intelligence and information on money laundering , illegal drug production and smuggling , which they required to prosecute those responsible for the drugs being distributed to our communities . #% Widespread genetic engineering of crops and food will surely lead to further intensification of agriculture and what of the health risks from GM products ; the EU Commission has banned the use of BST ( genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone used to increase milk production in the US ) for health reasons . #% I thank Mr Sacconi and all involved in this very difficult piece of legislation : a work in progress . #% Unfortunately , the debate on Europe which has been under way in the British media has been characterized by an absence of calm and rational comment . #% Why have I had to waste half an hour here ? #% Certainly , maintaining the second pillar structure is crucial and will prove to be central to the long-term success of the CAP . #% Because my constituent , Michael Shields , is serving a ten-year sentence for a violent attack of which he continues to maintain he is innocent . #% For instance , would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu , which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo ? #% We should now proceed to give it teeth . #% I have now been informed that the Council will not deal with my question or ten other Members ' questions because it claims it has not had time to prepare its replies . #% We can not have the most powerful state on this earth , which regards itself as militarily invincible , deciding which target it chooses to attack , which to disarm and how and when it will launch such an attack . #% They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen . #% Although I would like to see some tangible progress for the poorest nations , I suppose I should be grateful that in this latest round of talks no more Irish agriculture has been given away . #% Who would have forecast all this in 1941 , with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered . #% I believe , therefore , with the European Parliament , that the veto should go , and should go quickly . #% I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner . #% Sometimes , but rarely , there can be genuine reasons for delayed transposition of a directive and the nitrates directive has come in for particular mention in this regard here today . #% Our membership of the European Union appears to have brought out in people a cultural and heritage need to promote and foster the language . #% Today I raise this matter and put the British Government on notice that it can not hide the truth from the Finucane family or the European Parliament for much longer . #% Why has it not happened ? #% The Yemeni Government is listening to us and is taking note of what Parliament says . #% First is climate change , with the possibility of rising sea levels , and in Ireland , increased rainfall . #% He has served his sentence . #% - There must be full cooperation of all the Member States within the European Union if we are to play our full part in reducing the level of greenhouse emissions which are presently playing such a destructive role within our global environment . #% I am sure Parliament will agree that in the context of the present discussions on Agenda 2000 the viability of many family farms will be put at risk . #% This is only right and proper in the light of the fact that consumers are criss-crossing the frontiers of the European Union on a daily basis . #% A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country , Ireland . #% This whole institution lacks any kind of democratic control or democratic accountability . #% Commissioner , given the announcement on Romania and Bulgaria , could you comment on the indications from the UK and Ireland that they will not be opening up their markets to workers from these two Member States ? #% There is no one view within the Council so as the representative of the presidency , I can not speak on behalf of the Council . #% I will support those higher standards . #% This is not the case at present . #% The Commission must make full use of its powers under the EU Treaties , especially Article 169 , to open up the market . #% Council even went one step further by increasing the TACs for hake by almost a third where the Commission had recommended a reduction . #% In these difficult times , our primary aim must be , as this joint resolution says , to protect EU citizens , whether workers , entrepreneurs , householders , from the effects of the crisis . #% While I would stress that US toy safety legislation on testing requirements and standards is weaker than the European Union 's , and their problems with defective toys were greater , nonetheless the recalls for the same product occurred in July in the US and it took Member States until September to take action to withdraw defective toy products from the market in the EU . #% More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990 . #% Trains loaded with spent nuclear fuel from three nuclear plants in the south-east of England regularly cross London bound for the BNFL plant at Sellafield . #% We have , I believe , an historic opportunity now for a new beginning in which we can leave behind us our terrible and tragic past . #% As we move towards a new Millennium we are facing new problems associated with the wealth which is being created and the extra economic growth . #% No veterinary medicinal product can be used in food-producing animals unless maximum residue limits , MRLs , are set up for its active substances . #% If they were in Brussels or in a city in the UK , they would probably pay only a quarter of that . #% 
I would appeal to the IGC to listen to this Parliament , to the Convention and the 200 parliamentarians - from all sides of the political spectrum , both in government and in opposition right across Europe who produced the Convention document . #% We must engage in a wholehearted and unrelenting attack on these threats to our society . #% I would urge the House to support the joint resolution . #% Will it be more efficient ? #% How we voted on this also gave us a chance to have our say on some of the other aspects of the current economic climate , such as causes of the crisis , governance and financial market reform . #% The treatment of people seeking asylum in all EU Member States is absolutely appalling . #% Single-handedly he has caused his country 's political isolation . #% The specific point that I raised in my question , which I thought would be self-evident , was that because of sudden downturns in the economy in America and other parts of the world , there is increasing pressure being put on small and medium-sized enterprises in a very strict and rigorously competitive market . #% We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists . #% In a statement on 2 May Mr Duisenberg explained that in view of his age he did not want to serve a full term but added that in future , the decision to resign would be his , and his alone . #% If , by our discussions here tonight and our work over the next year each of us could get one single person into a quality job we could achieve a lifetime 's work because we have helped our fellow human beings to help themselves and they in turn can be the trainers , educators and ambassadors of the future . #% Furthermore , the public have a right to know what preparations are being made , what types of materials are threatening and what impacts may be expected . #% This has a two-fold effect . #% I very much recommend that you take on board the physiological function which unfortunately the rapporteur - and I do not agree with her - asked to be excluded from the report . #% I have a number of questions : What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets ? #% A more balanced economic policy mix is required . #% Firstly , on 9 October 2002 , the Commission concluded that 10 candidate countries were in a position to accede to the European Union . #% One of the ideas to emerge is the question of data retention . #% We need a pan-European approach to the issue of scanners - airport security needs to be uniform . #% However , when that imposition would help to realise a core EU principle such as social inclusion , then it is indeed important . #% The deadlines set under various articles are too short . #% We need to end impunity where it exists : outside the European Union , where we have influence ; but more importantly , within the European Union and in this case in a community in Northern Ireland . #% Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the current comitology provisions will be replaced by delegated acts and implementing acts under Articles 290 and 291 , as has been explained , but I worry very much about the role of the Commission in implementing the decisions made in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon . #% I would also like to pay particular tribute to our rapporteur who has brought forward a very balanced document which recognizes the new reality in which we now operate . #% It is unjustifiable in the twenty-first century that we are using such prehistoric practices . #% Mr President , having served as a politician in both parts of Ireland I am only too well aware of the difficulties in trying to negotiate an agreement which will be acceptable to all parties to the conflict . #% Three hundred workers will lose their jobs and 3 500 farmers will be very badly affected . #% The Irish people believe in the European Union and in enlargement , and will deal with these issues in its own time and in its own way . #% I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy . #% The Tampere special Summit , whilst focusing on immigration and asylum policy for the first time , also seriously raised the issue of trafficking in humans which has been steadily growing over the past five years . #% Two months on I have still to receive outstanding items and my visa card has been debited the full amount . #% I do not agree with the present policy , but within its framework stocks could have been conserved if the advice of the Commission had been taken through the years . #% In fact , as a member of the Reflection Group , I raised the whole question of the use of passports within the Union . #% Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely , and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights . #% The Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 is such an opportunity for my region . #% Surely it is a matter of concern to the Council when two Member States combine to exclude an EU monitoring body from their indigenous freedom of information legislation and so exempt it from provisions on providing the public with information that is available from all internal governmental bodies in those states . #% Finally , Taoiseach , why have you come here propositioning us with a dead Constitution that the Irish do not want . #% If we can respond clearly and effectively to the challenge presented to us , I believe we will provide a fitting memorial to the little girls who were so brutally murdered in Belgium . #% I would like to make particular reference to the unsatisfactory rate of uptake in the UK , Ireland and France . #% Supermarkets present their hurdles when it comes to a fair deal for farmers . #% How will they be discussed in the Council ? #% It is larger than the entire quota that an island nation like Ireland gets . #% The two projects I referred to are European models of best practice in this area and could be replicated throughout the EU-25 . #% The legal bases proposed are longstanding and not innovative in themselves . #% My fear is that some organic produce being imported into the EU is anything but organic . #% The point is , diplomacy is failing . #% Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances . #% It is fair to say that the United States is possibly three years ahead of the Union as regards the use of the Internet . #% I am entitled to that . #% Even if the tone of the communications today is rather low-key , they represent the crossing of a major institutional threshold . #% This can not be the bottom line for us in the future . #% Recycling rates for polyester bottles of up to 70 % have been achieved in Germany and the Netherlands to date . #% Irish fishermen have some serious concerns that must be taken into account . #% Mr President , the application of quality standards and controls is an essential ingredient of Europe 's food sector and , from a consumer perspective , we must be vigilant so as to ensure that all food products meet the most stringent production and market requirements . #% It is extremely disappointing to learn of the latest difficulty that has arisen in the negotiations between the European Union and South Africa . #% The resolution , which seeks to influence the Commission 's upcoming strategy for Roma inclusion , also calls for better protection of fundamental rights and use of EU funding . #% There were several snags which should have been thought about , but were not . #% The Irish Government has brought out a Green Paper on sustainable energy , which is to be given special status within our national development plan for the period 2000-2006 . #% As there was only a single vote available to us , I could not register my concern on the ` harmonisation ' proposal separate to the final vote . #% He has also appointed Ms Ann Hennon to assist me and I am also happy today to acknowledge the presence , in the gallery , of Mr Adair Dyer , who is the deputy secretary-general of the Hague Conference on private international law , specifically charged with the Hague convention dealing with this issue . #% Indeed , if you look at the Treaties that give the legal basis and authority to the Member States and to the different institutions to take action , the Council can in fact take action under the Euratom Treaty . #% Evolving players such as South Asia , Latin America and Africa require emission reduction policies that will not harm their economic development . #% In recent months there have been repeated attacks on humanitarian convoys and twelve aid workers have been killed in Darfur in the last six months . #% On employment , I hope that the high-level working group which has just been set up to examine the question of financing the trans-European networks will report back as quickly as possible . #% I ruled nothing in , and I ruled nothing out : the matter is still under examination . #% So I am doubly disappointed to hear you say , Commissioner , that it will be mid-February before you can come up with your new evaluation . #% 
Why isolate and point a finger at Islamic fundamentalism when we do not truly understand the meaning and the philosophy behind Islam anyway ? #% That is what the authors of this motion would have us believe . #% This must change , and I hope that our Member State governments are listening seriously to this debate . #% You will see from today 's report that what was Amendment No 3 has been penned over as 4 . #% Nobody ever thought that the poor old cows or sows or whatever were really being taken seriously . #% The International Criminal Court affords us the opportunity to ensure that not only captured prisoners or the lowest of the service people involved in conflicts , but also generals and heads of state can be brought to justice for genocide and for crimes against humanity . #% She was one of the nine ` disappeared ' who the IRA in Ireland claims responsibility for . #% Irish fishermen have faced hard times before but now they no longer have the control to work through their troubles . #% A recent study shows that American male smokers lose 13 years of life to the habit of cigarette smoking and that woman smokers lose 14 and a half years of life from smoking . #% De-coupling , modulation , degressivity and cross-compliance in place of good farming practice and an honest return for honest endeavours . #% I was genuinely disappointed that these issues were not addressed during the Dublin Summit . #% Let us not forget our achievements and goals in Bali . #% Today we had to vote for the third time on what was basically the same issue . #% The reason why I have asked to speak particularly tonight is because one of the amendments refers to my role as the mediator for the President of the European Parliament on transnationally abducted children . #% The success of the single European currency was brought about by careful , consistent planning which is now going to bring economic benefits to the 290 million people in the eleven participating countries . #% I await with interest to see how the British Department of the Environment intends to comply with its legal obligations under this important convention . #% It is not a question of defending an , but of looking to see how high-quality services to our citizens can be guaranteed across the board in what are new circumstances . #% One of the things that really worries me about this is why he did it : because he was afraid that he was not going to get the decision from the Supreme Court that he expected or that he wanted . #% The preparation process has been a detailed one . #% Food is being imported from other areas like , for example tinned food , chicken and other things , for which they can not guarantee the safety and they are not happy about this . #% Similarly I am opposed to the notion of creating human life for the sole purpose of harvesting tissues , after which this human life is to be disposed of . #% Like Mrs Stihler , however , I believe there must be greater flexibility . #% As a result , 66 % of the visible Maltese import and export business is done with EU states . #% In the context of the challenging issues facing the Union , such diverse headlines , downbeat as they are , capture more vividly than I can the absence of strategic progress . #% Secondly , would you not also agree that our aid to Palestine in fact contributes to eliminating the sort of conditions in which terrorism thrives ? #% Secondly , the Heads of State and of Government took the view in Amsterdam that there was no compelling case to involve Parliament in the administration of the common agricultural policy . #% It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards . #% The ushers themselves have tried their very best to be diplomatic , but they are subjected , and I use the word advisedly , to abuse by some smokers when they ask them to stop smoking outside the doors . #% Yes , we have a duty of care to the developing world , but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers . #% The European Union is only 50 % selfsufficient and stocks are falling , yet prices continue to go down . #% It is very clear that the European Parliament does not have the power to dismiss a judge at the Court of Justice . #% For economic growth , independence and freedom of action are essential with more , not less , national flexibility . #% So we must guarantee that we can deliver real skills and real training to people to allow them to get real jobs , not simply massage the figures to take them off the unemployment statistics for a few months . #% There were some good things in it , on enlargement and sustainability ; but in relation to defence policy , I just could not accept the idea of welcoming the rapid reaction force and wanting it to be operational before the end of 2001 . #% In the long term , we must consider the welfare of the animals and create incentives to reduce the need for long-distance transport . #% People in our industrial , declining , peripheral and rural regions need to know that EMU will have some benefit for them . #% Mr President , I too share the view of the previous speakers that the summit of European Union leaders was a success across a number of fronts . #% This also presents a considerable obstacle to developing common standards and comparative data protection . #% It is a pity , however , that we failed to discuss whether we needed more export promotion and , if so , what for , and to go into this whole question in more detail . #% For example , enormous amounts of money have been put into university-level students but no money into early intervention for children experiencing learning difficulties , to give them hope of reaching college or getting a job and not having a life of dependency . #% In the past , too many Member States have paid lip-service to the idea , but where there is a choice between trade and defence of human rights , economic self-interest has always taken precedence . #% The Irish Government has reached an agreement with the European Commission with regard to regulating our corporation tax regime . #% I am beginning to think that Roger and those of his political party are feeling a little bit that way since last weekend . #% 55 percent of all our milk is processed as skimmed milk . #% Among the elements of this resolution that particularly appeal are the recognition of the crucial role of small and medium-sized enterprises and the support that needs to be given to them . #% It is a peripheral area , an Objective 1 area . #% In the context of Agenda 2000 , very credible efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of succession in European agriculture . #% For Irish nationals this is very important , and it is important to realize under this heading that there is no threat here to Irish neutrality . #% Durban was not a failure , nor was it indeed a great success ; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime , something I have called for many times in this House . #% I regret that tonight we have not had a commitment to do a study . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Grossetête for her report . #% in writing . - I strongly support this Resolution which calls for an immediate ceasefire by the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE in order to allow the civilian population to leave the combat zone . #% What we have seen here today is the ability of an institution such as ours to raise our voices in grave concern and yet come up with no solution . #% This proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the European Union . #% Concern over this was also expressed from northern circles because the Bureau is active with regard to the language aspects of the Good Friday agreement . #% The situation for women in Iraq is unlikely to improve in the near future . #% I say that if the scientists can not go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing . #% Ireland has the biggest coastal area in the European Community . #% We have transferred to this Union 1 % of our national taxation , which is used in the interest of Community policies . #% in writing . - I welcome the fact that the new Directive 2009/48/EC on toy safety will come into force in 2011 , although it is regrettable that the directive will not be in force for the Christmas 2010 period next year , when the majority of toys made or imported into the EU , are sold . #% I welcome the action of the Irish Government in initiating a process whereby the extra options will be looked at . #% We need to fight discrimination wherever it is found not just in the workplace . #% The President-in-Office made a few remarks about human rights , which I think are a very important part of our agenda . #% We in the Committee on Budgetary Control do that on the basis of a report from the Court of Auditors and the Commission 's annual financial statement . #% The Irish presidency should be doing everything in its power to ensure that these people are not denied their basic human rights for a minute longer . #% The global figure is something close to 200 million for child labour . #% 
We also believe that the Indonesian Government should call a halt to the army 's commercial activities in Papua . #% The World Health Organisation is putting GBP 7 million into research and I am asking you tonight to give your commitment to a European Union study to look at potential links between DVT and air travel and preventative action . #% I do not believe that there is a conflict between economic development and sustainable development , nor that we can not put in place an aggressive taxation policy to create employment , to ensure that business and industry can have a competitive environment in which to succeed and prosper , and that does not necessarily lead to the detriment of social protection , or of investment in social services like education , health and infrastructure development . #% I know that the euro currency has experienced some trading problems at times during this year . #% I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading . #% Babies ' health is too important to be left in the hands of a multinational company 's marketing department . #% They want to make sure that those rights are never taken away again . #% It is currently in receipt of monies to develop a new tramway system in Dublin and a tunnel to take freight from the north side of the city - the M50 in the airport area - to the docks , thus keeping unnecessary freight from the city 's streets . #% In trade agreements with China and other countries we always have human rights clauses , but we are so timid about the implementation of them that they might as well not be there . #% They are also essential for the preservation of cultural traditions and practices , which must be preserved . #% ( IND/DEM ) . - Mr President , today we are debating a resolution about humanitarian aid . #% I know you accept this , Commissioner , and you have said so in a previous response . #% Mr President , the Commissioner stated that exposure limit values for natural radiation were not deemed to be feasible , and I want to emphasise that point . #% Independent journalists reporting on political trials have come under extreme pressure , while several human rights organisations report that deaths have occurred from injuries sustained from torture while in detention . #% There is no disgrace in reform . #% His commitment to keeping his message simple , human and , above all , relevant , is also greatly to be welcomed , because if we do not do this , and include the citizens in our programmes , the vital survival of this Community will be at risk . #% While this is very welcome , it does not give much detail . #% I doubt that there is a constitution in any of the Member States which achieved the kind of consensus that the Convention achieved . #% Within a generation there will be two billion more people on this earth , 90 % of whom will be born into what is now the developing world . #% Can the Commission tell us if things have improved in the newly-signed protocol , particularly in relation to the fact that ship owners can opt out simply by paying a small fee , which they would be well capable of doing ? #% When dealing with this type of legislation , we have to be mindful of its impact upon pilot fatigue . #% Therefore , I was somewhat heartened by the daring-to-risk-going-bust attitude of the conference because that would give us experience to know the main reasons why small and medium-size enterprises fail , whilst at the same time recognising that they are the biggest engine of growth within the overall European Union economy , creating something like 82 % of employment and representing 74 % of all manufacturing . #% Edmund Burke , a great British parliamentarian , said : `` All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing '' . #% The most important issue , as you , Taoiseach , and every other speaker emphasised , is the draft Constitution . #% The report states that an act of malice - and this was presented to us before September - could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high-level waste tanks , in Sellafield in particular , with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl . #% We note with particular concern the Commission 's report of last week - the pre-Stockholm report - about the Lisbon process . #% in writing . - Dear colleagues , it is with delight today that I address this parliament as we have moved towards a more equal role in the relationship between richer and poorer countries while strengthening human rights . #% While I recognise that European industry is a world leader in this technology and I commend its achievements , the current state-of-the-art CO2 systems have a number of disadvantages which make them unsuitable for export outside the EU . #% Mr President , the anti-European camp wants the constitutional ratification process to be discontinued . #% We must ensure that when we hand down our countries and our continent to future generations , they are in a better condition than they were in when we inherited them . #% We will always remember Amsterdam ; we will always remember the European single currency . #% Leaders of the 25 governments of the European Union meeting in Brussels later this week will formally give the go-ahead -- or not -- to accession negotiations between the European Union and the Turkish Government . #% During this debate it has at times been difficult to distinguish heat from light . #% We have heard from admirers of Jean Monnet this morning - I am also an admirer of Jean Monnet . #% So , there are those problems but by linking the human rights clause in this agreement and the non-execution clause we are provided with further leverage in pressing for observance of these rights . #% We need to reintroduce some level of capital control and not turn ourselves into a completely open space for multinationals , which is what Europe is being turned into . #% If I had to point to one single factor that has contributed more than any other to the turnaround in the Irish economy , I would have to cite the Social Partners ' Agreement which allowed us to trade competitively in the single market and to attract inward investment because of the stability it brought to wage negotiations . #% Contrary to the hysteria and misrepresentation spread by certain sections of the EU press , there is no question of dawn raids on teenagers in their homes . #% We could use solar energy to heat our houses , if we so wished . #% As to the issue of climate , all I can say is that in Ireland we do not have a climate , we have weather . #% There is no safe way . #% I also reject any lowering of quality standards for inland waters compared to coastal waters . #% Mr President , when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high-level group 's report , it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals . #% We must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat . #% But now the report is before the House and the House must now exercise its mandate however it sees fit . #% I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme . #% The prevention of the use of the European financial system as a money-laundering route for terrorism must continue to be a priority for our Union . #% Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the job under way ? #% It is particularly important to carry out this diplomatic and information activity with the so-called Group of 90 , comprising the ACP , the African Union and LDCs . #% However , any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced . #% That is why the Stability and Growth Pact is a good thing , in spite of the faults and mistakes in its operation that have recently been highlighted . #% I believe that history will justifiably acknowledge her contribution , if the present negotiations bring permanent peace . #% As you can see , Chancellor , despite the fact that you took on board some of the ideas Parliament spoke about ; despite the fact that you included parliamentarians with regard to decision-making ; you still get criticised for not being here enough or for not doing enough within Parliament . #% These are issues which have to be taken on board . #% But it was an important advance . #% I am now asking the Council and the Commission to make an immediate decision at 5 % set-aside with the current level of area aid maintained . #% It is vitally important that the European institutions , as well as national governments , undertake a comprehensive process of education amongst all sectors of the population and not just amongst the financial and business community , as seems to be mainly the case at present . #% Mr President , I recently attended a conference of Arab women in Beirut . #% We call on the Council and the Commission to make financial assistance available if a civil case proceeds . #% However , I do not want this directive to be used as an excuse for credit providers to opt out of the very high consumer protection that is already offered in other Member States . #% Some Member States are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency , and I hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit . #% It would be a terrible blow to the democratic process if the people of Europe were not asked their opinion on this matter . #% But the enlargement of the European Union is a real success story . #% It is now up to the Member States ' governments to take the initiative provided by this report , and I urge the Dutch presidency to examine this issue as a matter of some urgency . #% We can not and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs . #% Mr President , at the part-session here last month I raised this very question of the problems of flying to Strasbourg . #% 
The fund will act as a hand-up rather than a handout , as the money will be forwarded to third level colleges in the Munster region to pay the tuition fees of former Dell employees . #% We do not always get it right in our part of the world , but let us look at the women 's issue in Saudi Arabia and move ahead on that together . #% This issue is one of major international concern , but I know that it could not be in better hands that those of the Commissioner . #% The word ` cohesion ' did not pass his lips once . #% We can not reasonably expect the farming community to have the balanced view of this issue that the wider community needs . #% I hope that the peace and stability and the resulting prosperity which we have enjoyed in the second half of this century will continue as a result . #% This presidency is being entrusted with two very difficult chapters in the negotiations on enlargement , namely agricultural policy and regional aid . #% If you are sincere in what you are saying in advocating for the rest of Europe a knowledge-based economy , perhaps you could start by ensuring that our Irish universities and third-level institutions are adequately funded to allow access to the greatest possible number of young people . #% Much of this is due to the continued industrialisation of the sector , developing even larger vessels which require fewer people . #% That goes for the Socialist Group and I will let the Liberals answer for themselves , for I understand they did not stand up at the Conference of Presidents and allow us to have a resolution before us . #% I would say to Commissioner Kroes that competition is the objective , not the problem . #% I beg my fellow Members to help the Irish people and vote for that amendment . #% That being the case , if products are not available in the EU from a voluntary and non-remunerated supply , we should not prevent products being imported from outside the EU for the protection of human health and the delivery of services to people in need . #% In particular , I would urge that close attention be paid to those areas where resource gaps have been identified . #% Now , Canadian water is a particular target of the water multinationals . #% Finally , the Council representative has alluded to the fact that the right of citizenship is also applicable to children and minors , and is therefore a basis for common action . #% I come from a country that has benefited from the EU 's structural funds . #% Let us not forget that this is against a backdrop where the Galileo satellite project started off with a budget of EUR 7.7 billion and is now projected to cost EUR 22.6 billion . #% We should not be so dictatorial with our directives . #% Fishing communities which have seen their fleets cut must now be supported to be able to retain what is left and encouraged to break in with new developments . #% Please put pressure on the Irish Government to finally ratify Aarhus , even at this late date , and see the people as an ally rather than an enemy in the effort to protect the environment . #% We know now that the election results were so close that the opposition must be given a role in government to reflect the massive popular support they now hold . #% Against this more open-minded background , I wish to make a few points . #% However , with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU , export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them . #% The voice of areas heavily dependent on farming , like Northern Ireland , must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy . #% I welcome the chance to improve the survival chances and financial prospects of UK small companies and also to contribute to the overall competitiveness of the EU in boosting job creation . #% Madam President , I just wish to refer to the last item on page 4 - the statement by Mrs Green , leader of the socialists - in the English version of the Minutes . #% The whole issue of unfair competition which people are criticising is caused by the fact that the industry itself is exploiting workers in certain parts of the world . #% In conclusion , as regards setting the tolerance thresholds for adventitious presence of bone spicules and technically unavoidable contamination , it is imperative that we apply scientific rigour through standing committees under the comitology procedure . #% This Parliament must exercise the most stringent controls in that area . #% Mr President , I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Hence our abstention on the two reports . #% Like my colleague Mrs Doyle , I am glad to see the derogations agreed for Ireland and indeed also for Portugal and Greece . #% It is a deeply disturbing phenomenon in my own country . #% I regret that in their contributions neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to make an acknowledgement of that sacrifice . #% In a recent poll in England , 71 % were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council . #% Mr President , while the European Parliament has no formal role in the ratification procedure , I am pleased that , as the elected representatives of 25 Member States of the European Union , we are having this debate today , at a point in time when the ratification procedure has just got under way at parliamentary level and is just about to get under way at referendum level . #% I agree with Allan Macartney when he suggests that the policy needs a fundamental reappraisal and that the disadvantaged areas should be given more control over both the exploitation and the marketing of the resource that is adjacent to them . #% Secondly , what should be our approach to this kind of material arriving from outside the Community ? #% The intention of the introduction of this legislation , as I said earlier , was protection of health and safety . #% The great thing about this Commission and the European Union is that they have allowed people of different political ideologies to put aside their individual ideologies in order to arrive at a consensus for the common good . #% But by the time I reached the plenary , you had moved on automatically within a few minutes to Question 49 . #% To collect car taxes for a reason like environmental protection makes sense . #% People have whispered about this for years , but those of us who did not experience it listened with incredulity and , I have to add , a certain amount of disbelief . #% I signed in and I voted in a roll-call vote but my name is not there . #% When you move into a new home , there are always problems . #% Reports of planned cuts of up to 30 % by the Irish Government to some services amply illustrates their lack of real commitment to prevention , protection and prosecution . #% I support the adoption of a code of conduct and the establishment of a European monitoring platform . #% We must ensure , however , that we bring men , particularly young men , into this debate . #% I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana , on behalf of the European Union , to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations , but the European Union is undermining his efforts , in my view , by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel 's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated . #% In doing that , let us build a world for the new century and the new millennium in which there will no longer be any war or any conflict but total respect for diversity . #% The essence of the best idea and the best debate is when you have divergent opinions , coming together to try and garner the best from the situation . #% As you know , Commissioner , the concept of fairness differs between Member States , depending on their different legal systems . #% in writing . - The EU budget post-2013 must be fit for purpose to maintain competitiveness , to increase economic growth and to combat high unemployment in Europe . #% I believe that the EU can make a further contribution today . #% In this Parliament we hear again and again about exchanging best practice between Member States . #% It is unthinkable to have a modern European Union constitution - which is what the Convention on the future of Europe is looking at - without a binding bill of rights . #% I apologise , as I did not intend to be discourteous to the House . #% We are often accused of being remote in this institution , of not being in touch with our people , but on this occasion the EU is working for its citizens . #% On top of that I believe the present Amsterdam Treaty for the first time underlines the importance of employment within the overall European Union development . #% Given the volume of beef and sheepmeat that is entering the EU at present levels of protection , it is equally certain that most , if not all , of the gap in the EU market created by the reduction in EU supplies will be filled by products from third countries . #% The overcrowding problem on suburban trains will also be eased by the addition of more passenger carriages , and platforms will also be lengthened . #% Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq , as a minimum , to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence . #% Finally , I do not believe that anyone would seriously contest our aim of reaching a situation in which our higher levels of prosperity are copper-fastened and ensured on a permanent and sustainable basis . #% Because of the advent of liberalisation and greater competition , which I welcome , let me hasten to add , we have also learned of some of the mistakes that can be made by just having a headlong rush into liberalisation . #% EU citizens were affected by what happened in Chile , citizens from almost every Member State . #% 
To be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support . #% One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people . #% Mr President , Ireland 's version of the social dialogue , which we call social partnership , is well established and has played a major part in the economic success which our country has achieved over recent years . #% Congratulations to our two rapporteurs , firstly Mrs Read , who has always been a doughty supporter of telecommunications . #% The recent unrest in eastern Chad , including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army , underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) from getting caught in the crossfire . #% I agree with the proposer of the motion that this is most urgent and should be discussed here immediately . #% Secondly , unlike my Conservative colleague , Mr Purvis , I do not believe that we should take a rigid view of the reform of funding post-2006 at this stage . #% As Mr Collins indicates , Ireland has made full and proper use of the structural funds , so much so that if the funds were being allocated in 1996 under the present criteria , i.e. , GDP per capita of less than 75 % of the EU average , we would not qualify . #% That is a matter the Commission , and specifically the Commissioner responsible for the budget of the European schools , has to address . #% I requested in my 2008 letter to Commissioner Kyprianou that the original recommendation be revised , as it was then four years overdue for revisions , but there have still been no updates . #% We already vaccinate our cattle for a whole array of diseases and consume them daily . #% Colleagues should be aware that if they vote in favour of Amendment 2 , they are voting in favour of adding Friday sittings to the Strasbourg calendar next year . #% However , I strongly disagree with the ideas of right-wing political Islam and of Hamas . #% He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication . #% However , it is not essential for the IGC to conclude in the first half of next year : it is of far greater importance that the Member States use the IGC to confront the issues which are of general concern to our electorates and to lay the foundations for a successful enlargement of the Union to the East , even if this requires an additional six or twelve months . #% Mr President , I wish to draw your attention to what I term a silent invasion of Europe by an alien species , , otherwise known as the American grey squirrel . #% The number of air miles involved in transporting the products is also a consumer concern . #% The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans . #% Would he not agree with me that this is the case ? #% The US forces in Iraq are simply not able to ensure the security of either Iraqis or foreign nationals . #% Only a few years ago , Rosemarie Nelson , the mother of a young family , was assassinated by loyalist paramilitaries because she was a human rights lawyer . #% In fact , that is what is responsible for bringing it into Northern Ireland . #% I believe that the utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic , regional cohesion , and that the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of regions highly dependent on fisheries . #% Mr President , I would like to use this short speech to call for the immediate reactivation of the Ferries Directive , which was allowed to lapse after the Council of Ministers failed to agree on its implementation . #% The European Parliament now has the power of codecision with governments of Europe in over 50 fields of legislative activity . #% We have demanded that international and national humanitarian organisations , as well as journalists , be granted full and unhindered access to the combat zone and to the refugee camps and we call on the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with countries and aid organisations that are willing and able to evacuate civilians . #% In doing that I hope we will not give the national governments an opportunity to create the impression that the responsibility for high rates of unemployment lies with Europe . #% The legislators ' dilemma is to produce good effective law which protects the consumer , while allowing business to thrive in a dynamic and competitive environment . #% But it is a level playing field , fair is fair , and the nuclear sectors can not be subsidised . #% However , whatever we do , we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened . #% Part of the EU 2020 strategy states that ` by 2020 , all young people in Europe must have the possibility to spend a part of their educational pathway in other Member States ' . #% Equally , in relation to sheepmeat , important to European , and particularly Irish , farmers - badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods . #% I supported the overall impact of the Bösch report . #% The intention to place the reinforcement of European security and defence policy high on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council is an appropriate one . #% I should like some clarification on whether the report , which you indicate as being finalised , is the report dated 15 November 2005 that has already been circulated in draft form to the social partners . #% A number of things have been mentioned . #% The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world . #% Only recently at the opening of an exhibition in Brussels by the ambassador of one of the Arab countries , he availed himself of the opportunity to tell me how difficult things were for him and his colleagues . #% I would ask the Presidency of Parliament to intervene on behalf of these people . #% It is actually a modest programme , with EUR 200 million allocated for four years , which is frankly still inadequate . #% The European Community and the Member States wanted to forward an extensive list to be considered if possible before the first COP next week , but in any case in time for examination by the first meeting of the POPs review committee . #% As regards the workings of the Convention , I very much welcome the suggestions that have been made here today . #% I am not surprised that the pharmaceutical industry is supporting this directive , since it plays right into their hands and means more business for them . #% I raised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starving . #% Secondly , does he believe that the Portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout Europe when that decision was taken ? #% It is now up to the Luxembourg presidency , as leader of the Council , to find a compromise and to find a way forward at the European Council meeting . #% Mr President , I should like to add my congratulations to those already expressed to the rapporteur , to the Spanish presidency and to Commissioner Busquin who has been exemplary in his patience , understanding and respect for Parliament 's opinions . #% Mr President , I commend the rapporteurs on their reports . #% When we recognise the great need there will be to rebuild Iraq , we must also recognise the tremendous need to rebuild the relationship between the European Union and the United States . #% And , if not , could it make one at the next part-session at the beginning of July in Brussels ? #% Understanding the nuances and repercussions of our decision is certainly not an easy task . #% This must be a key part of the European Research Area . #% Mr President , the resolution of the World Conference against Racism held in Durban is not exactly what many would have hoped for . #% Perhaps I made a mistake in putting this question to the Council rather than the Commission , because there is immense frustration in Ireland , with young people in particular . #% An example is that biotech produces therapeutic treatments which are intended to benefit patients . #% I wanted to ask a supplementary question but I am afraid that I am going to have to return to the two parts of my question which have not been addressed . #% All of those and the work on the common area of justice and security are to the credit of the Commission . #% If EU Structural Funds are going to be applied for the desired purpose , namely to improve the economic and social cohesion of different regions , then these monies must be spent as additional financial resources . #% I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint . #% Last week saw the downfall of a Commission in which some members had already made a start along the road to ` berthelisation ' , and in future we will always be ready to condemn any Commission that again succumbs to the Berthelot syndrome . #% In conclusion , I fully support those who say that there should be no co-financing of the common agricultural policy . #% Gathering such information may seem difficult , but in reality a great deal of information is already in place : insurance companies have detailed data on accidents ; police have data on violent and self-inflicted harm . #% Furthermore , there is still a concern within Europe with regard to a few sensitive national concerns . #% I was a nurse , I dread to tell you how many years ago , but in those days the technical demands on both doctors and nurses were considerably less than they are now . #% The mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria has proved extremely resilient to the various methods of dealing with it down the years . #% Madam President , I welcome this joint resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal Kurami . #% 
It matters in any field and , in this case , if public health , by reason of its scale or effects , can be better achieved through the cooperation of Member States , then this should be encouraged . #% It was a tragedy of immense proportions , as has already been pointed out , resulting in over one thousand deaths and many thousands more being injured . #% We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement . #% They are imported from Thailand and distributed by a vast network of counterfeiters across the region . #% It has been estimated that 100 of the largest companies in Ireland will exceed the current emission rates between 2005 and 2007 . #% Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives , with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities . #% The applicant countries have made substantial progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria , with regard both to the transposition of legislation and to the implementation of new European regulations and directives covering a wide range of economic and social sectors . #% Because when you look at humanity no two human beings are the same . #% Without a doubt , should it be our priority to ensure that our people are protected against the dangerous affects of nuclear waste . #% It is a fake , but was sold to consumers on the high street at full price . #% Plants that can not meet rigorous international standards should be decommissioned . #% We have fought for years within the European Union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market . #% I also object to the deals which have been struck at the last minute behind closed doors resulting in a compromise package which seriously weakens the provisions for must-carry services and for people with special needs and disabilities . #% . This proposal is part of an ongoing review of the legislation to prevent and combat future outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Classical Swine Fever . #% Mr President , this happens month after month . #% This means that a total of EUR 1,850 million will be made available over the seven year period of the new programme . #% Mrs Thatcher would be proud of the way we have carried on and she would be particularly proud of Terry Wynn this evening if she recognized the way he is defending what she fought so long for in relation to the European Union budget . #% Scientists differ in their interpretation of the impact , if any , of BSE on public health . #% It will take generations for the people of Haiti to fully recover from what will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event . #% The Commission outlined with clarity that EFSA , the European Food Safety Authority , has said there are no safety issues involved . #% It is something we have a great responsibility to do something about . #% The genuine work that has been done is , as has been said , a PR exercise -- a whitewash exercise . #% When Parliament adopted the Services Directive , those of us who were concerned about its impact on workers ' rights were assured that the proper enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive would deal with our concerns . #% Unfortunately , we still have a debate about children who are apparently trapped , waiting for adoption out of Romania . #% In 1996 ICAT adopted a resolution saying that the contracting party should promote the use of mono-filament leaders in recreational and long-line fisheries . #% I would like to emphasise also that we must do everything possible to support and encourage seafaring as a profession within the European Community itself . #% Berthelisme , of course , Mr President , is not confined to the corridors of power of the European Commission . #% in writing . - This report on the Annual Report on Human Rights 2008 evaluates the state of human rights actions around the world and calls for improvements in some key areas . #% One paper talked of a bizarre show of relaxed leaders who dodged the most crucial issues facing Europe . #% The Commission must urgently review its approach to the aviation industry . #% We ask the Commission to prepare for a reduction if that proves necessary . #% In five months time or so , when the Irish Prime Minister comes to this Parliament to report on Ireland 's presidency , he will be judged on one aspect in particular and that will have to do with the effectiveness of the measures taken during the presidency to deal with the unemployment situation . #% The Commission needs reform and Union needs a strong , independent , politically reformed Commission . #% Those of us entrusted with the task of ensuring a future for our past must now act with decisiveness . #% In conclusion , I have one comment on the overall fifth framework programme . #% It would be very useful to have this information on the breakdown as regards fish . #% The illegal bombing by the US and Britain , which is not covered by any UN Security Council resolution , has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous : it should not be allowed to continue . #% If it had been in the text itself it might have been legally binding . #% You said , first of all , that you should not get involved in telling people what you will do if the Irish people vote against and that , if there was an alternative , the Irish people would want to know what that alternative was . #% Such an approach does not allow enough flexibility to take account of new products placed on the market . #% Clearly this technology is not new , nor is it unique , and patenting of software business methods such as this is not good for innovation and competition . #% The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced , while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises . #% It is worth noting that by June 2001 Malta had closed negotiations on over 17 different chapters , including important issues ranging from education and training to telecommunications , fisheries and consumer protection . #% In my limited time I shall add my voice to two specific calls that the report makes . #% I am happy to support the motion on the floor today which will ensure that these rights are supported - the rights of parents to raise their children , and the rights of children to that protection and support . #% It is clear that commitments entered into by various parties , instead of being built upon , are in fact being reversed . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , as Irish soldiers leave for Chad to protect refugees from neighbouring Sudan , I am again painfully reminded that this tragedy of genocide in Sudan continues day in and day out , without any end in sight . #% It is only when we have that kind of interinstitutional friction that we will truly achieve the best results . #% Yet we do not take one measure in the form of renewable energy which would certainly provide jobs . #% Madam President , I would like to say that Parliament 's position is a balanced one and has weighed up all the pros and cons in this debate . #% I am very aware of the concerns of the horse industry , particularly the thoroughbred industry , and I do not have to remind the Commissioner that if a full and up-to-date range of therapies is not available , there is a real risk that foreign investment in stud and training establishments throughout Europe will be lost to third countries . #% We must be committed to ensuring the widest range of opinions and values , and that they are nurtured , expressed and considered because debate can only increase knowledge and improve the quality of decisions . #% In the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict . #% I also feel that Turkey must consider repealing clause 301 of its Penal Code , which is being used to charge dozens of Turkish writers with insulting Turkishness . #% Preventing tobacco-related illnesses would do more to help the citizens of the Union than any other life-saving measure , and tobacco companies are wrong to claim that advertising does not promote smoking but only promotes brand loyalty for a legal product . #% Additionally , there are regions within Ireland , including the midland region , that still fall well below the EU average in terms of employment and economic growth . #% If other Member States then proceed to behave in the same sort of way , this could lead to individual items being banned in every Member State in the Community at different times , and there will be no guarantee that the single market , which we worked so hard in this Parliament to bring about and to consolidate , will work properly . #% After the democratic transition in Serbia , the Union lifted its sanctions to repeal the oil embargo against Serbia and the Union lifted flight bans . #% In other words , the issues of the efficient running of enterprises are as pertinent in western , developed market economies as they are in developing countries . #% So I can really empathise with those who feel passionately about the need to be able to bring animals freely throughout Europe subject to the conditions being laid down today and I welcome the report here before us . #% However , for some reason those who lobby in favour of Mrs Breyer 's group are not lobbyists and , apparently , those who have a different point of view are lobbyists and thus decried . #% The Irish Government has so far refused to do this . #% Our response in Ireland , from what I know of other EU countries , tends to be slow and ungenerous . #% They will exert pressure on politicians to allow them to go fishing to try and make some money . #% I am sorry that the honourable Member did not pick up what I said on the first occasion but I hope he will now . #% Security of employment in the future for those who are fortunate to have employment at present is an equally important issue . #% 
These offices and the staff assigned to work there are funded at considerable cost from the annual budget of Parliament . #% Whilst the modern car is 40 times cleaner than its equivalent in the 1980s , air quality will be greatly enhanced by the implementation of the proposals before the House . #% We have also learned a lot in the last year in relation to new variant CJD and that patients with a distinct genetic makeup are prone to it , not the entire population . #% I ask the Commission once again to consider , on another issue , an application to the WTO , or GATT , to have our beef export quotas increased . #% In conclusion , the scale of employee participation will be decided through free negotiations between the companies concerned and the workers . #% Will it more effectively secure the financial interests of the European Community or the European institutions ? #% This report goes into a lot of detail about what a new human rights clause could or should look like , how it could be monitored and enforced to make it more effective and what the consequences of breaching the clause might be in different cases . #% The issue of habeas corpus is also in danger here - the guarantee of safety while somebody is in custody . #% It does not make sense that we should now be negotiating with the European Commission , following all the events of the past several months , a new code of conduct which , inter alia , insists that where there are issues of importance the Commission first comes here to tell this House what they are and then to take a procedure , such as the annual Report of the Court of Auditors , and say : there was a leak , it is a bit unfortunate , but let us get on with business as if nothing happened . #% With regard to the matter in hand , I should like to pick up on a point made by the Commissioner earlier today when he talked about the attempt to make foreign policy more effective and to warmly welcome and subscribe to his view on the indivisibility of the Union 's foreign policy . #% It is my hope that the EUR 6.199 million will help produce a successful way out of the crisis for the workers , their families and the area #% Some people may not like the fact that the Technical Group has been set up , but it has been . #% Already the fall-out from BSE has cost farmers millions of pounds and left consumers both confused and bewildered . #% The current programmes must be streamlined and simplified , making application and access easier . #% Mr President , today 's debate is timely as the 50th Eurobarometer report which has just been published clearly shows that concerns about unemployment are only just higher than the citizens ' desire for action against drugs and crime . #% In particular , a situation where , as a result of market design , allowance prices significantly exceeded the long-run marginal cost of abatement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable . #% Like many other species , stocks are far below sustainable levels , and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities . #% Certainly , from an Irish perspective , Irish people recognise the importance of the Commission as an institutional body within the European Union . #% On the manufacturing side , the industry has in the past provided a very important employment opportunity in the sugar plants , in addition to supporting employment in associated industries . #% They have put the economy of Georgia under tremendous strain , not just in economic terms but also in human terms , deporting hundreds of thousands of Georgians from Russia back to their home country , denying them access to education and to businesses which they legitimately own and control within Russia . #% However , the specific issue I wish to focus on is regional aid . #% There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding people from the new Member States . #% Fortunately we , as a society , have developed in our attitude towards giving future protection to the elderly , those in need of pensions and the most vulnerable within our society . #% But we have nothing like a proportionate say and influence in terms of foreign policy . #% It is pro-citizen and it is pro-consumer and I would strongly urge the Commissioner to consider this proposal favourably , particularly in view of the fact that it is so pro-consumer and pro-citizen . #% I do not have the time to develop any kind of linguistic or analytical subtlety on my next point . #% His years of experience and expertise in this field make him eminently qualified to deal with such an important matter . #% I will mention just two . #% Mr President , over the summer I took the opportunity to be briefed by some of those in industry in my region . #% If properly financed , LIFE + will give us the means to promote our special areas of conservation and thereby promote biodiversity in Europe , which is being lost at an alarming rate . #% in writing . - Small businesses are the backbone of the European economy , accounting for 98 % of all European businesses and employing up to 60 % of the EU 's workers . #% When we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap . #% We have decided , Mr President of the Commission , to turn your shield of collegiality into our sword of parliamentary accountability . #% One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying ` you are either for a federal Europe or against it ' . #% If those advocating change within the Iranian regime need help and support through debates and discussions with people like us , why are not we giving them that ? #% It is a very serious problem for a very large number of borrowers who are finding it increasingly difficult to meet interest rates which prevailed five , six and seven years ago at treble the rate which we have at the present time . #% For this reason I have serious doubts about the proposal to maintain the present budget ceiling into the next perspective . #% What is most in evidence is that it has brought voluntary organizations together and these organizations in turn have brought their public representatives into closer contact and greater cooperation with each other . #% While we are planning our own compensation package , let us remember third countries like Mauritius , which are being devastated by our sugar reforms . #% Will the Council undertake to keep the decision on the review and request the Commission to ensure that airports in Objective I areas and Objective I areas in transition are not penalised by the loss of revenue resulting from the ending of duty-free , which inevitably leads to higher prices for consumers , loss of earnings for airlines , shipping companies , ports and airports , and threatens employment for the industries and small firms which have supplied a range of goods to duty-free shops ? #% If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 . #% Democrats choose the camera shot , Sinn Fein chooses the rifle shot . #% My Group will therefore be supporting the resolution from the PPE-DE Group . #% It is a question of who represents the law : the drug barons and the murder squads or the police and the justice department or the politicians . #% Is it not possible , out of courtesy to Members , to take questions together when they relate to the same subject ? #% As lime and dolime can only be produced by removing existing CO2 from limestone and dolomite , there is no way of reducing the CO2 emissions . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for their comments . #% Rather than trying to construct a new consensus , as Mr Barroso suggested last week , we should concentrate on strengthening the current European consensus on competitive markets , fiscal discipline and hard currency . #% I know personally that three accession countries are having serious problems . #% Due to the particular nature of diseases such as rare cancers , auto-immune diseases , toxic and infectious diseases , there is not enough expertise and resources available for them , yet nevertheless they affect 36 million EU citizens . #% Madam President , I had not intended to intervene but some of the questions that have been raised here and in the debate are based , perhaps , on a certain misunderstanding . #% The budget as a percentage of the EU Gross National Income should reflect the agreed priorities of the European Union . #% Inclusion in the Treaty needs to be followed up with responsibility for the wide range of children 's issues being coordinated by a single Commissioner and unit within the Commission . #% In particular , I call upon the Commission to help alleviate some of the difficulties the Hungarian negotiators are facing with internal bureaucracies within the Commission and speed up that whole process . #% We recognise that within the current constraints Professor Prodi is taking some steps to improve the dreadful situation of the past , but we may need Professor Prodi to take some more steps . #% I thank Mr Thomas for his report . #% Last week in Northern Ireland the forces of the state capitulated in the face of lawlessness . #% When we see someone with a disability , instead of focusing on the disability , let us treat everyone as equal , focus on their ability and give them the tools of information , of training , of education and of opportunity to really show how much ability they actually have . #% Changes should not be brought about too quickly and can not be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed . #% The theory is good , but the practice has been awful and has not matched the theory at all . #% I have strong reservations in relation to up to five of the Commissioners , but based on his curriculum vitae and experience , Mr Buttiglione has the ability and aptitude for the job of Commissioner . #% We can not defend our values by abandoning them and I suspect that some of the people involved in today 's debate would much rather we abandoned our values just to prove themselves right . #% The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century . #% It could set a very bad precedent for the future for other Member States and for nominations to this body . #% These people are often the victims of great discrimination on our territory and pursuant to this legislation , third-country nationals will be able to move within the EU with the same guarantees when it comes to their social security entitlements as EU nationals . #% The adult handicapped sector has plans for reform but there are no substantial initiatives as yet , again reflecting the recent interest we have taken in this in the EU . #% 
Ever since the opposition to the THORP nuclear plant in 1993 , the level of radioactive discharges from nuclear operations in Cumbria has substantially increased . #% Mr President , as this matter was agreed just prior to the vote I want to be quite clear about the separate vote , because the complete voting list was only available this morning . #% His failure to do so should be met with only one response and that is the military option . #% Although the overuse of bushmeat is a fast-growing problem everywhere , this report concentrates on Africa because the bushmeat problem there is the most significant and best-described in the literature . #% He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State . #% . The ` European Year of People with Disabilities ' raises awareness of the concerns of over 40 million people in the EU with disabilities . #% We probably have it right on paper , but it is in terms of implementation where this may fall down . #% I am glad that Mr Prodi emphasised the overriding importance of sustainable development , which has implications well beyond the natural environment . #% I think the media should investigate where the weapons that the Hutus are now using are coming from . #% At that meeting a proposal was made that a delegation should go from this House , not to Israel again or the Palestinian territories , but to Dublin to ask the Irish presidency what can be done urgently in the way of conflict resolution . #% That really is what the debate is about in this House today . #% The original paragraph 5 referred to an ` Australian proposal to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II with a zero quota ' . #% None of our countries can claim to be free of these threats . #% I realise there will be a debate on this matter , but unfortunately I will not have the opportunity to express an opinion on it . #% Alternative fuels have been a live agenda item in this Parliament for a number of years but we do not seem to be any closer to a practical outcome . #% The Commission and the Member States have taken the necessary steps , with the full co-operation of the farming community and the beef industry , to guarantee safe farming and food production practices and a safe product for the European consumer as well as for our vital export markets . #% At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments . #% We must all continue to play an active and constructive role in the enlargement process . #% There is also the option of strengthening the controls of the European Union borders with Eastern Europe and finally , we should consider the formulation of various partnership agreements with the Eastern European States to deal with this issue . #% Social Europe means nothing if it means putting people in traditional crafts out of work . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for making statements to us . #% It is time to reinstate Irish fisherman as stewards of Irish waters . #% There should be a ban on them . #% My report is not -- as some lobbyists would believe -- an attack on recreational fishing in any one Member State . #% My next point is the topical question of fraud and irregularity . #% We want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment . #% However , one of the conclusions I have come to is that we need to look closely at the manner in which financial services are regulated , because it would appear that we expect a regulator to do two functions which are distinctly different . #% Every country has a right to promote its produce , but not at the expense of others ' . #% The fourth point concerns competitiveness . #% I will use the meeting at the end of the month between Congress and the Members of this Parliament to further promote the dialogue and ensure that we can restart it . #% In the interests of openness and transparency , there should be a clear breakdown and a clear outline of how much is going where and what the results are . #% It is important that such an industry thrives . #% On the Armenian issue , I believe that it should be mentioned in the report , but it should not be introduced as a new precondition for membership , as we should remain committed to the original criteria if we are to stay credible . #% It was a decision made in good faith . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this comprehensive report . #% I believe this to be completely unacceptable as a policy for the European Union or its Member States . #% The relationship between the European Commission and the European Parliament must not be based on strict contractual terms . #% I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members . #% While I welcome the proven success of the Erasmus initiative , I would recall that there is certainly room for improvement in the manner in which this scheme is administered now within the European Union . #% Europe can not , on the one hand , work with democratic movements in Libya , Syria , Tunisia and Egypt , and refuse to work with a government democratically elected by the Palestinian people . #% I will comment on just one of them , namely your determination to complete the single market in the gas and electricity sectors . #% The integrity of the Union requires all who believe in it to proceed together along the same road and in the same direction , as clearly set out by our founding fathers . #% But the real challenge for the Irish presidency will be to get concrete results so that these aspirations are not left as empty sentiments . #% In normal circumstances it is only criminals or suspected criminals that are fingerprinted . #% I hope it does not , but we must be ready if it does . #% This inquiry must therefore continue . #% This is fine and good , but it must be conditional and selective . #% The reality is that unless we are competitive , that unless we allow our businesses and enterprises to prosper , to grow and to compete on the world market we are ultimately doomed to fail ; not only in the sense of protecting existing jobs but also in ensuring that we try to find new forms of work for the long-term unemployed . #% The commitment in the Amsterdam Treaty to preventing human illness and disease goes even further than the present Treaty and is therefore to be welcomed . #% It has to be said in fairness that the former Commission led by Jacques Santer was as much a victim as an author of this process . #% But let us be clear . #% Would the harmonisation of the base not lead to a harmonisation of the rate ? #% Does the Commission not have any appreciation that the opponents of the Constitution are just as proud of the defeat of Nazism as anyone else and that we take great offence when she tries to hijack and monopolise that sentiment in order to advance the political agenda of seeking to promote this Constitution ? #% From an Irish perspective over 90 % of our waste is still dealt with via landfill sites . #% The wider political roadmap is still there on paper and so we do not need to reinvent the wheel here . #% Commissioner Fischler has stated that the EU must work for sustainable fishing wherever EU fleets operate and we shall hold him to that goal . #% Investment in a clean environment in Ireland will , in the medium to long-term , justify the additional expenditure . #% Parliament has a right to know . #% The Committee of Inquiry has made an important contribution to the debate and in this regard we must congratulate the rapporteur , the chairman and the members of the committee . #% The weakest and traditionally most vulnerable of our rural community , in terms of social welfare , and smaller farmers are being dealt with in the harshest and most unjust manner by our state . #% I came to vote today with my colleagues in the ELDR . #% Another saying we have at home is ` at least no one died ' , but this is no longer true : people are dying . #% The women of the McCartney family -- Paula , Catherine , Donna , Gemma , Clare and Bridgeen -- who are ordinary women in every aspect of their lives , have done something extraordinary . #% The problem with the Gallagher report is that it does not address these points and simply argues the case for regionalisation . #% The only two legal cases pending against the Irish Government include one with regard to the provision of waste management plans ( similar cases are being taken out against several Member States ) . #% If we had a European Prosecutor dealing with our own resources - we do not want to take it any further than that - I think the focus of the authorities in the Member States who actually spend this money would be sharpened . #% 
Equality of education means that people must have the skills that are required for the jobs that are going to be available . #% As far as labelling goes , I am very disappointed that the Council did not adopt Parliament 's recommendation in the first reading that `` tested on animals '' should be clearly stated on the product label . #% A few years ago a feasibility study was commissioned by the sugar processing sector in Ireland , with a view to producing bio-ethanol using surplus sugar beet . #% Strengthening control was one of the key priorities of the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy . #% However , given the fact that the matter has been raised here in the House and has been raised with various Ministers in their Member States by a number of organizations , I think this is a matter which is worth re-examining . #% I join Mrs Flesch in complaining about the quality of translation . #% I am bound to say on behalf of my own group that the Liberal Democrats here in this House are unhappy at the pace with which the thought of having a systematic ban on the free movement of labour became the politique acquise . #% The rate of growth of the sector and its diversity both make it one where future regulation will be necessary . #% There is no data relating accidents to the working time of professional drivers and no data distinguishing between employed and self-employed drivers . #% Then there is the complex question of vaccination , even if it is not on the Irish agenda . #% People are paying higher prices for organic produce . #% I am calling on the European governments which will be represented in Bonn to use this conference as an opportunity to tell the US that this is not good enough , and that the full provisions of the Kyoto Agreement must be implemented : under the Agreement alone , the US Government would be required to cut emissions by approximately one-third by the year 2012 . #% We must ensure that we can help our colleagues in the Danish Government withstand the pressure they are being put under by voices in the media to go back on their present position . #% We also stress in this report that we are concerned about the lack of progress on Equitable Life , on which the Petitions Committee did some work in 2007 and on which I chaired the Committee of Inquiry . #% This Commission proposal states that noise reduction efforts are now to be assessed on the basis of individual airports , with a view to imposing operating restrictions on aircraft . #% If farmers have to farm 100 % of the area they farmed during the reference years 2000 to 2002 in order to draw down the decoupled or area-based payment , it will put huge pressure on the price of rented land or Conacre as we say in Ireland both in Ireland and in other countries . #% Through the air transport liberalization programme the European Union has taken steps to create the climate necessary for airlines to offer competitively priced airfares to the citizens of Europe . #% The blanket of secrecy has been lifted . #% I fully support the position taken by the Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection , Mr Byrne , when he states that it is dangerous to assume that a Member State can protect its citizens ' health by its own efforts alone . #% So when I hear the Commission talk about EU values and standards , in view of its support for sanctions on Iraq I wonder how sincere it is about the children in Turkey . #% They need patent protection that is affordable and enforceable against industry giants . #% Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary surgery which may involve particular risks . #% There is no word here that EU arms supplied around the world are the cause of many of the disputes which we talk about settling . #% It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction . #% Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union . #% They have only dealt with the macro-economic issues at the level of a national economy and ignored the regional impact of EMU , or have ignored the relationship between EMU and cohesion policy . #% Various NGOs from inside and outside the Republic of Yemen approached me and my colleagues from time to time with criticism about certain corrupt practices and inefficiencies in the judicial system , about individual human rights abuses sometimes perpetrated by the security forces , and the arbitrary imprisonment of many thousands without due process . #% Our group will have to decide tomorrow on this report , on the basis of what amendments are passed by the House . #% What the European Union should not do is to carry out any further debate on new political developments within the Union before the Treaty of Nice has been ratified within any of our respective Member States . #% In particular I should like to thank them on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , and indeed the Socialist Members , for the very good work that was done throughout that period on the reform of the structural fund process . #% When we have completed the process of enlargement , we will be economically and politically more powerful . #% While I support the precautionary principle , I do not support a ` preventionary ' principle . #% I would also like to see the inclusion of the Erasmus Mundus programme in the Integrated Programme as of 2009 , when the present programme has run to the end . #% But it is not the panacea to all consumer disputes . #% Already we have lost IRL 200 million in tourism receipts since the outbreak of FMD in the UK some weeks ago . #% Indeed we have fish killed in our rivers and lakes and this is an annual occurrence . #% Others have taken up our cudgels . #% I understand the meeting of the internal market is on 26 November and it is hoped to adopt a common position at that Council meeting on that date . #% I also want to congratulate my colleague Mr Cunha on his report . #% I believe it is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey . #% I voted against Amendments 31 and 37 as the wording would be interpreted to also include a ban on therapeutic cloning , which I support under proper ethical conditions . #% I would also ask the Commissioner to think again about the whole situation as far as the Organization of African Unity is concerned and its desire to intervene directly in the situation there , to bring about peace and stability insofar as that can be arrived at . #% Indeed , the Christian gospels say it is worthy of a millstone around the neck . #% We certainly would hope for the future that we might be able to develop procedures to allow for what might be described as more questioning in depth of nominees . #% Each cabinet member should be absolutely required to leave office with the Commissioner . #% There is nothing to stop others being more ambitious in achieving delivery . #% On the issue of the EU-Russia summit , which you also mentioned , it is essential that the major issue of Chechnya be raised with the Russians . #% That is quite extraordinary , considering that we are one of the most stable and peaceful regions in the world . #% I believe that what is now proposed with this ` Charter ' will eventually lead to conflict between the interpretation of rights under the different documents , which could create a legal vacuum and , ironically , reduce the rights available . #% It is particularly important to say that at this time . #% I have to ask the Commission and indeed , we all have to ask ourselves , why is the multiannual guidance programme not being implemented ? #% The ` Lisbon strategy ' of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 may have failed , but this does not mean we should abandon it entirely . #% While there may still be some inefficiencies in that market , it certainly does not reflect the whole picture . #% The first is in relation to Mr Stevenson 's attack on a Belgian minister who is not here to defend herself . #% It does not require a constitutional amendment , but it would be useful to have it incorporated into the protocol relating to national parliaments which we are currently debating in the Convention . #% Mr President , first of all I want to be associated very much with the words of sympathy expressed with the people of Galicia and I fully concur with the speakers and my colleagues who called for solidarity with them at this time . #% An indication of the potential of genetic research to make a positive contribution to food production is demonstrated by the very recent announcement by Monsanto of a significant breakthrough on the genetic structure of rice , which is the staple food on which millions in the developing world depend and about which there is considerable concern with regard to the continuity of supply . #% Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland . #% Of course it will be costly but what price do you put on the life of a child who may be knocked down on the road , or a patient in hospital who may receive wrong treatment as a result of the fatigue of a doctor ? #% Mr President , I am really delighted , in this plenary part - session of Parliament , to again be addressing you on the subject of Malta 's accession to the European Union . #% In my region of Northern Ireland there are many beautiful beaches , several of which proudly boast blue flag status . #% The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead . #% Moreover , this same watchdog is made up of elected members of the sole party in government . #% They should also have the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law , have access to legal representation and have the right either to be charged or released . #% I wish you and the Irish Government well with the very onerous agenda which it falls to you to push forward . #% I am delighted that you have been so realistic as to describe the cuts as drastic , because that is all they can be described as . #% 
They see how the Commission is working in this whole process , and what they see is that it is those on the minimum wage , those who are in collective agreements , are being hit with these austerity plans . #% The EU 's credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it can not mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational . #% We have amendments on subjects such as renewable energy sources , energy efficiency , and combined heat and power . #% I think we have managed to achieve an agreement which will free up circulation of safe products on the internal market , while introducing a tougher regime to detect dangerous goods and prevent them from coming onto the market and obviously maintaining tough rules , which we already have in place for food safety , medical equipment and blood products . #% I want to stress that the publication of the Green Paper on sustainable energy in Ireland should be viewed as a positive contribution to the debate on how we deal with climate change threat within the energy sector . #% Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble ? #% Still there is no resolution of the problem at European Union level , still the Commission sits on the fence and speaks about the complexity of the issue . #% World energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions are expected to rise by 60 % by 2030 . #% I would appreciate persistence in pursuing the issue of Mr de Roo 's amendments . #% This report seeks to urge a better application of Aarhus , but we in Ireland have no application . #% Firstly , I wrote to you in connection with the Arias Cañete vote , because there was some confusion there . #% Let me assure you that , if the EU decided to ban live animal exports today , the Australians would step in and take over our markets straight away . #% While I am appreciative of the work undertaken by these different departments and their different mandates , increasing the levels of cooperation and coherence could greatly enhance the protection afforded by Natura 2000 sites . #% The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed , this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports , so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements . #% Madam President , one would expect nothing less from somebody like Mrs Roth , whom I consider an extraordinary individual . #% It should include incentives allowing the Member States to clearly support advantages for the regions , especially rural areas , in respect to labour intensive green production . #% Under Basel II it would become essential that risks analytics are timely assigned to financial services operations . #% As the record will show , I have answered those questions unequivocally and properly . #% Will we give an equally positive response to the people who , through courage or desperation , flee these human rights abuses and arrive legally or illegally at our borders ? #% In short , this new compromise directive may not give all political groups all of what they want , but it will remove many barriers to cross-border trade and services and reduce the red tape that businesses encounter when they try to expand into other EU countries . #% The most vital requirement of energy and environmental policy as we approach the millennium is to meet our Kyoto commitments , and here of course a CO2 tax would have a major role to play . #% Madam President , coming from Northern Ireland as I do , I have to say that there is hypocrisy in both President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair . #% Globalisation is happening and while there are risks it presents us with immense opportunities . #% Can the Commissioner tell us tonight whether the British Government put forward proposals for such a package and whether that package will be forthcoming ? #% However , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties . #% But what we disagree with in this report is the way that it has emerged from the committee . #% The support provided to organic farming should be used to help open up new opportunities for the sector and to create an alternative to so-called conventional farming . #% Robbing a poor Peter to pay Paul is an inverse Robin Hood policy and is at best perverse . #% Israel-EU trade is worth EUR 27 billion annually . #% We need to do more to spell out clearly to young people the brutal consequences for one 's health from cigarette smoking - that three thousand people in Europe die every day from cigarette smoking . #% I believe our farmers - and , if I may say so , particularly Irish farmers - have no difficulty in producing a product of the highest quality and safety . #% This is completely unnecessary . #% The allocation of EUR 200 million in European Union aid to help Haiti rebuild in the long term is a positive start , but , when the cameras have left and the world 's attention is turned elsewhere , the European Union , as a global leader , must act and live up to its responsibility . #% Mrs Green made a very valid point about 35 , 000 Turkish troops in the northern part of Cyprus . #% in writing . - In the current economic climate , it is hard enough for small and medium businesses to survive without the added burden of late payments in commercial transactions . #% Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliament 's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices . #% I suppose , then , what we really should be focusing on is that fascism , communism , imperialism and the totalitarian regimes we have experienced on our continent have a common thread : a lack of respect for human difference and different ideas and an intolerance towards those who want to chart a different path . #% That is why we set the target between Parliament , Commission and Council of spending 20 % of the basic spending on education and health . #% Mr President , as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market I object to Mr Lechner 's attempt to mislead this House on an interim court ruling that has come out of the European Court of Justice on the ban on tobacco advertising , not on health warnings , which is what we voted on yesterday . #% In my view we are not responding to these short-term difficulties . #% Of those taking part in the discussions , he was far and away the most skilful and appeared to show the most stamina . #% Yet the integrated coastal zone initiatives already in existence are floundering , due mainly to lack of financial support . #% Whereas we are denied import quotas , China 's state owned factories benefit from export subsidies , state aid and even free electricity , as well as the benefits of its artificially undervalued currency . #% Parents need to be aware of some of these issues before they marry or before they create children . #% Nuclear energy is not sustainable and we need an intense debate on this in Parliament and with the Commission in the process of evaluating this technology . #% I welcome -- as most people do -- the recent initiative by the G8 to implement further the process of debt relief for the Third World . #% Having eventually banned the use of meat and bonemeal the British Government then completely failed to implement its ban . #% The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages , such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets . #% I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report . #% I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that . #% Mr President , I wish to take this opportunity , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party , to congratulate the various rapporteurs . #% The government of national unity , which was set up in 2009 to bring about democracy , is obviously not working , due to his efforts to ensure that it does not . #% It is not acceptable that public health be put at risk like this . #% It would be irresponsible to leave our needy regions in Britain with uncertainty and insecurity over future grants . #% If you are not going to allow him to take the floor , I would like to put a supplementary question to Commissioner Schreyer on Mrs Scallon 's question . #% We will have no directive on mergers and takeovers and we will have no information and consultation with rights for workers , even though mergers and takeovers will continue to happen across the European Union . #% This leads to serious misunderstanding and mistrust . #% Last week members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had an opportunity to have an exchange of views with the director of the Dublin Foundation and the report before us clearly shows that the Dublin Foundation is managed carefully . #% Our European institutions must be courageous and provide leadership on the rights and needs of our children and young people . #% It is all the more welcome , therefore , that we in Parliament should take the initiative in matters such as this where we can make a real and tangible contribution to the rights and legal protection of our citizens . #% The work of Father Shay Cullen is typical of the work carried out by Irish missionaries not only in the Philippines but throughout the world . #% The role of farmers as guarantors of sustainable and quality food supply must be brought more into focus , because we ignore at our peril the fact that agriculture is a commercial activity . #% However , any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair . #% They need our help . #% The Commission must take this into consideration and be much more reasonable . #% There is a broad consensus in Parliament about the role of services of general interest , economic interest , and of their importance . #% 
Bloodless or not bloodless , a coup is a coup . #% We can all agree on one thing : farmers everywhere in the European Union certainly did not need this disease to come upon them at this moment in time , and certainly the farmers in the United Kingdom did not need it at all . #% We need more sustainable living , not only because of the carbon challenge but also because of the concerns we all share about rising energy prices and energy security . #% in writing . - I wholeheartedly welcome the approval of $ 7.45 m in EU aid to help retrain 850 workers made redundant from SR Technics . #% As a spokesman on human rights , I would be a hypocrite not to demand clarity as to whether or not detainees have been transferred through EU countries to third countries where they may be at risk of torture . #% Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States . #% Local supply and local branding are keys to success . #% Like my colleagues I would like to emphasize the role for space education . #% Mr President , key to the 1994 directive were targets for Member States for packaging recovery and recycling , to be set initially for a five-year phase and thereafter to be reviewed for subsequent five-year phases - and hence we are here today . #% A common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates . #% We have heard them here tonight about the car industry . #% However powerful we may consider ourselves to be in this Parliament , we can not legislate for sunshine or rain across 25 Member States . #% author . - Madam President , I want to make a couple of important and essential points . #% Think of the real infrastructural change this vast volume of money could have made if spent internally on the real needs of the UK since 1973 . #% Linguistic and cultural diversity is not about defining or redefining boundaries ; it underpins the cultural strength of our enlarging European Union . #% It is three years since the Delors White Paper and still all we have are words and not deeds . #% Mr President , over the last month , serious momentum has been building up with regard to the process of EU enlargement and the fulfilment of our political vision in this respect . #% It would have benefited from the structural funds , amongst other things . #% Because it is clear , certainly in the case of Congress , that they are a major influence on the role of the US executive , and we here are a growing influence on the executive , although we still regret the pillar system that marginalises us in areas of foreign policy or in fighting crime , and so on . #% Finally , with the accession of six new Member States between the years 2004 to 2006 , we all collectively have a lot of work to do to ensure that this process is a success . #% Mr President , I am using my one-and-a-half minutes to give once again a very brief report to Parliament on my work as the President 's mediator for transnationally abducted children . #% On a date when he alleged I signed in late I actually was present early that morning voting in my committee . #% If individual Member States were to expend the same effort and energy addressing the issue of how , as nations , to compete in a global market as they did in preparing showcase summits , then I suspect we might all see much more product . #% I went around the cities of Europe with Mr Colom i Naval and others and we asked them to sanction expansion of the budget by the 1.27 % - we needed at the time . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for her willingness to go over time and take extra questions . #% According to this report `` the trend towards tax rate competition may lead to a drop in income tax '' . #% Member States have been attentive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and have taken the most important aspects of our recommendations on board . #% The first steps of the new DCI framework are being taken and we all have responsibilities to get it right . #% Changing this to patenting is a recipe for handing the software industry over to lawyers instead of the creative people who have led the boom in technology . #% The decisions on how to reduce the fleet should consider not just the status of the stocks the fleet fishes but also other impacts of the fleet . #% If you allow it to happen in one Member State , it is the thin end of the wedge : it is going to happen in other Member States as well . #% in writing . - I support this report on the EU 's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms ( ECHR ) , as provided by the Lisbon Treaty . #% Emissions from the developed world are the primary reason for global warming . #% Mr President , like you I welcome the final referendum which took place in Latvia this weekend and resulted in a strong ` yes ' vote for joining the European Union . #% I welcome the fact that Macau 's crime rate has also improved . #% Contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , I am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in Dublin . #% My Group will vote for censure . #% I know that Nice does not impact on Irish neutrality . #% Control is also a very big problem in most of these agreements . #% They too must be condemned . #% Let us have space policy in the Convention . #% Bearing that in mind , as well as the comments made by other Members , it is important that a certain number of key factors are laid down so that the public can understand what we are about within this Parliament . #% This is more demanding than the standards required under the Nitrates Directive in the nitrate-vulnerable zones . #% That may be true of Hong Kong , but not in Ireland , where a sugar industry that supported 3 500 families has just been wiped out . #% Regulation of F-gases has led to toxic graveyards of leaking fridges in some countries . #% We have only one alternative to offer them , namely fish farming . #% It is essential that the primacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted . #% There has to be a better way of controlling it . #% The Presidency is independently preparing a comprehensive report on questions to be examined at the IGC and on the various options for resolving them . #% The CEO of the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world EADS has actually bemoaned the fact that the US already invests six times more than Europe in armaments research and that while the research budgets in the US continue to rise , those in Europe stagnate . #% Decisions concerning key national entries will remain the exclusive domain of individual Member State governments , and any changes concerning taxation policies or social security matters will be left to individual countries to decide on . #% Trade coupled with aid and debt relief is essential to the achievement of the 2015 Millennium Goals so concrete results with regard to the development aspects of the Doha Round need to be achieved during the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference . #% I would like to see a communication in 1997 to allow Parliament to take decisions in this vital area of policy . #% The same arrangements in 1996 will ensure the continuation of at least an orderly fishery and the tuna fishery is now one of the most closely monitored fisheries in EU waters . #% This represents over 45 % of the packaging waste on the Irish market , all of which would previously have gone to landfill . #% Some regions in Ireland are clearly out-performing other regions in terms of economic performance and therefore all regions can not and must not be put into the same bracket for the next tranche of structural fund money . #% Under my reading of the rules , which were adopted by the Bureau without consultation with Parliament , I am entitled , as a Member , to stand up at every roll-call vote and state that I am present but I am not participating in the vote . #% I would invite him to visit Northern Ireland and the border countries and to see the situation for himself . #% We have made progress in Amsterdam , in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the new draft Constitution on re-establishing the rights of citizens to public services . #% They then discovered some years ago that , in fact , they have no protection whatsoever . #% The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% Madam President , let me begin by saying on behalf of my group that we fully share the perspective of Mr Prodi that certainly from tomorrow we stand on the threshold of a new beginning ; a new beginning in particular between our two institutions , Parliament and the Commission , and a new beginning for Europe itself . #% We are now faced with what appears to be a sudden problem on account of the large population . #% Longer-term financial assistance is required , and EU governments must take the political decisions to make these broader financial commitments available to the Iranian Government . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer and also to wish him well for the Swedish Presidency . #% in writing . - I support this report on implementation of the European consensus on humanitarian aid . #% 
Madam President , I have no doubt that the existing arrangements for cooperation in the area of VAT fraud are inadequate in the context of the evolved single market . #% Indeed , I agree with Mr Hatzidakis that they have all run a marathon . #% I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points . #% I agree with the proposal that a guarantee fund should be set up to ensure the stability of fuel prices in a level playing field for the Community . #% I believe that we must give more support to the victims , and I think that then clearly identifies who was the victim . #% Farmers have been traumatised by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it . #% Thousands , even millions of adults will face adulthood with cardiovascular disease from a paediatric medicine tested for its effect on behaviour , not hearts . #% However , it would be counterproductive to ban these gases in such a way that we simply destroy European companies , while simply moving manufactured products that use F-gases to countries that do not ban them , countries that may even see an EU ban on fluorinated gases as an opportunity to capture the refrigeration and other related markets . #% I would add that I hope it will also be a fair conclusion . #% I am advocating a dual system in which the road tax increases with engine size and , within each engine size category , by energy efficiency . #% I also want to mention the Minister for European Affairs , Mr Dick Roche , who here in Parliament was so open to meeting with individuals and political groups , who engaged fully with all Members on any issues or discussions that needed to be carried out - not only with regard to the Treaty , but also with regard to ongoing political developments here within Parliament . #% Only when the EU is seen to be contributing to the solution of major problems in society , such as poverty and unemployment , can we expect to enjoy their support and ensure the credibility of the Union and its policies and institutions . #% in writing . - Today 's vote on human trafficking comes at a crucial juncture in the ongoing fight against this form of modern-day slavery . #% Now we are suggesting that LSD and Ecstasy are consumer products that should be distributed like sweets . #% It is not difficult to transpose that kind of ideology into a direct consumer-service-provider relationship also . #% Farmers in my country are already suffering a huge decline in income . #% In that context , the role of politicians is to look at economic fundamentals in the real economy ; the role of politicians is to achieve an appropriate level of convergence ; the role of politicians is to define what is the desirable level of price stability internally . #% Secondly , Europol , by its very nature , is reactive rather than interactive or proactive . #% As a Member of Parliament representing a largely rural constituency , and coming from Ireland , the Member State most heavily dependent on agriculture , I fully endorse the stringent thrust of this proposal . #% Peace talks between Israel and Lebanon which have been frozen since 1966 - and the conditions in which Israel ' s withdrawal from Lebanon is achieved - will be of particular importance for the safety of UNIFIL personnel who are based there . #% We would ask , for example , that energy efficiency be used as an indicator in the Lisbon and Barcelona processes . #% As to the IGC , it is important that the draft treaty being prepared is not based on the lowest common denominator principle . #% Let us not forget their courage and sacrifice in safeguarding freedom and democracy . #% I would ask him to withdraw them straight away ! #% That system is independent of the political influence of any party in the Republic of Ireland , as I am sure the system also is in the UK , including Northern Ireland . #% So we should not have a debate based on misunderstanding . #% That is why Labour Euro MPs voted against calls for a 5 % budget increase . #% I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed , transported and slaughtered . #% Freedom of worship is a fundamental right recognised by most of us in Europe . #% In the last ten years there has been an unprecedented rise in forced and voluntary migration worldwide . #% A world-class Titanic exhibition centre is planned for the very site where that famous ship was built . #% I understand and respect the arguments of those who say that the European Parliament has no competence or right to make such a demand . #% We welcome the fact that the report has included some very important things , such as waste reduction plans . #% It would have been useful if we had known the outcome of the final meeting before this debate , but unfortunately I do not have any information from it and it is probably not possible to obtain it . #% So , there is a great diversity . #% This issue of cost will have to become a parallel priority in our debates . #% But I want to direct some very pertinent questions to the Commissioner and I hope he will answer those questions in his response . #% Finally this is a budgetary matter only . #% That is the wrong road to go down . #% There is a link between that instability and our failure to take the necessary measures . #% This display of lawlessness at the highest level of government is unacceptable in a Union based on the rule of law and solidarity . #% In order to take advantage of this positive relationship , the institutions of the EU must ensure an agreement that is modern while being full and fair for all . #% We must work towards a more progressive system in which workers are entitled to keep as much of their earned income as possible and there is better provision of services in the social sphere in areas such as housing , health and education through the national exchequer . #% I think it is very important as a matter of public record that we should have a declaration in the clearest terms from the Commission in a body , that it is continuing to act as the essential European prime mover of enlargement . #% This hardly supports the fundamental principles of democracy and subsidiarity . #% It was interesting to hear what the Commission said in relation to modern agriculture that these residues are an unavoidable factor . #% I welcome the fact that FIFA is going to use that tournament as an opportunity to crack down on racist acts at football matches in Europe . #% In a recent case in the UK , an eleven-month trial running into millions of pounds was replaced and resolved by mediation in a matter of days . #% We should all recall that this story emanated in the United States , where there is deep unease about what may be happening . #% We have had political differences in the recent past but the time has now come to put these problems behind us . #% I also feel that the Commission was most wise to avoid reference to nuclear power in its own proposals and I would advise you to keep to this approach because it is a most divisive thing to propose , and we will certainly not agree to it . #% The Commission states that there was a more recent assessment by Spanish scientists . #% This is because the contract limit is too small and the economic reality underlying this is that to move your operation into another Member State requires extra money and a more valuable contract to make such a move profitable . #% Undoubtedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer . #% I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee 's negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door . #% If you look at the figures , even the more stringent budgets in the Community are only slowing the rate of increase ; they are not reducing spending . #% I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer . #% This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU . #% I would like that put on the record now , rather than tomorrow , because it is of fundamental importance to me , coming as I do from a neutral country . #% I expect the Commission to give careful consideration to effect our positions on the strategy papers . #% On the one hand we have a political and , indeed , a moral obligation to honour the Treaty by admitting new members in accordance with it . #% We need to look at where we are going . #% The most important step is for both sides to desist from further acts of violence . #% Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint . #% It seems to me that there is a huge amount of support for substitution , while only the PVC industry is reluctant . #% Our big challenge now is to implement the REACH regulation in our respective countries to ensure that it gets proper representation for those who send us here . #% 
We really need to get our act together at Council level there and indicate a capacity for a maturing EU relationship with all the states in that region . #% Many farmers lost crops , animals and even their homes . #% The people who murdered him should be obliged to face judgment in the courts and to serve their sentences in prison . #% This ban will apply to new vehicle types in 2011 and to all new vehicles in 2017 . #% We can learn from the experience of the United States and avoid disastrous mistakes such as the Enron affair . #% Targeting him by kidnapping him is not only an appalling crime in itself , but it is self-defeating in terms of the Palestinian people 's cause . #% In conclusion , we share the vision expressed here today . #% The costs involved are very real , with direct implications for jobs , consumers and electricity generation . #% These decisions , however , were tarnished by an unseemly squabble among some Member States about the location of European agencies which reflected the worst features of the old way of running Europe . #% They will not thank us then for a headline-grabbing , ego-satisfying deal at the WTO if we have cut off from ourselves a secure supply of reliable food that is home-produced . #% However , we still lag a considerable way behind our European partners in terms of our infrastructure , in particular transport , telecommunications and environmental protection facilities . #% The Commission must centralise the information concerning the effects of PVC in our society so that appropriate measures can be taken at national and European level to reduce any possible public health consequences from its use . #% What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations . #% We have an obligation to be serious about our contribution to the future development of the Union and our ambitions for a better way forward have got to meet the expectations of all the citizens of the European Union . #% First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy . #% Terrorism has to be fought decisively , but the means employed can not be allowed to create an environment of insecurity for citizens ' rights which is the very objective of terror attacks in the first place . #% Through this same hard work and willingness to interact peacefully with the rest of the world , it is becoming a significant economic player globally . #% I urge Members , therefore , to vote for the agreed negotiated package that is before us today at first reading . #% In relation to the reduced need for long transport , it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat . #% Greater protection of the environment is , of course , important and the European Union has made a start in the right direction in this regard by finalizing the SAVE III programme which is designed to support measures for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere . #% Mr President , nicotine is regarded as a highly addictive drug . #% We also need to stimulate research and innovation through tax incentives or innovation vouchers , and by improving the conditions for risk capital investment , for instance for business angels or cross-border venture capital . #% Never mind an injection from a doctor on duty for 16 or 18 hours as another speaker mentioned . #% Do we want a vibrant , living , well-maintained countryside or do we want a giant national park without people - and especially without young people ? #% The budget in these fields is going to increase next year and in the 2007 -- 2013 financial perspective . #% For example , the EU 's new directive on regulating pollutants obliges oil companies to sign up to ensuring that the sulphur content in petrol is cut by a threefold reduction and that the sulphur content in diesel is cut by a seven-fold reduction by the year 2005 . #% I agree with my group that the main competence needs to remain with the individual Member States , not because I want to suggest that we keep immigrants out of the country , but so that we can begin seriously to address the chaotic situation that exists in many of our countries regarding the processing and acceptance of immigrants . #% Genetic modification has been part of food production since the beginning of agriculture . #% As regards the modified proposal on the efficiency performance reserve , Parliament must be involved in decisions on the mid-term review and the reallocation of the national reserve . #% The examples cited by many speakers here are very relevant and it is important for us to remember that we must give real meaning to vocational training , that is to give people the skills they require to be able to take up the new opportunities that arise . #% Mr President , I wish to put firmly on the record tonight that the farmers in Northern Ireland are exceedingly angry at the UK Government for not seeking European funding to help promote beef labelling . #% I have huge concerns about the possibility for Member States to cut 20 % of market support measures and direct payments and to allocate it to rural development . #% As the Commission points out , tens of thousands of human beings - especially women and children - are trafficked for exploitative purposes each year . #% Lawlessness can not be allowed to be the answer to lawlessness . #% I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned . #% I commend this report to the House and would ask that it should not just be an expression of good intentions or the conscience of the Members of this House or of the Commission , but lead to real action before 2003 , so that then when we celebrate the European Year for the Disabled Citizen , we can actually say that we have made progress and moved beyond some of the barriers . #% Basically what Mr Arias Cañete wants to do is continue with the existing system which rejects changes and improvements proposed by the Commission . #% I would argue too that the notion that social security is simply a safety net needs to be avoided and that in reforming our social security systems we have to give particular attention to eliminating poverty traps . #% But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses -- not just in Burundi , but in so many other parts of the world . #% What steps are being taken to deal with that issue ? #% He has paid the ultimate price for his bravery . #% I would like to focus in particular on the SME sector and on the kind of supports that we can put into place at Community , national level and at local level . #% I know some colleagues are attached to this proposal , but it would be hard to defend it at world trade level because of this insignificant extra environmental benefit and because of this it could be perceived as a technical trade barrier . #% We are suffering widespread climate instability because of that failure . #% We are now at last making good progress under the direction of Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Bonino . #% I just wish to finish by saying that I understand that the GUE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 5 . #% I believe that you are genuine in your expression of appreciation of the role of the European Parliament . #% Archbishop Courtney was heavily involved in the peace process and played a significant role in bringing about this recent progress . #% It seemed for a while that we had learned from this grim experience and there was a determined effort in the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure more coherence in our common foreign and security policy approach . #% Mr President , I voted against this resolution because I feel Parliament is extremely reluctant to criticise NATO and NATO 's actions . #% Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 commits coastal signatories to integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas . #% It has also been reported that there have been violent protests by peasant farmers in the Thai Binh province . #% Indeed , every day I hear of job losses in the textile sector in the East Midlands which I represent and only last month I learned of another 350 jobs that have gone in a women 's clothing and child wear sector in Huthwaite in Nottinghamshire . #% This is for us a core challenge . #% The Member States have placed the concerns of industry and their own cost concerns ahead of the interests of our citizens . #% In this regard , I anticipate with some enthusiasm a positive response by the Irish people to the Treaty of Nice . #% Funding from Daphne has had a positive impact on the work of many Irish women 's groups . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the statements they made before Parliament today . #% Furthermore , what is the Commission doing about monitoring the returnees into Rwanda when they reach their villages ? #% We can not change the rules and we can not deny it to them . #% Women , despite the fact that they make up over 50 % of the population , are still discriminated against . #% The structural funds should be maintained at their present size for the 15 Member States until the objective of creating a level playing field throughout the Union has been achieved . #% I support respecting the sovereignty of the Afghan people , but the Karzai regime is corrupt and does not reflect the interests of the majority of the Afghan people . #% If EU Member States fishing in Guinea do not provide reliable and detailed data on what they catch , Parliament wants the Commission to begin legal proceedings against them and even to revoke their right to fish under the agreement . #% Instead , he delivers clear and factual information quickly to the people . #% As well as the problems of marine pollution , European citizens are also alarmed that our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms , drugs , cigarettes and human beings . #% 
The announcement of over 2 000 jobs leaving the region from Dell , together with thousands of ancillary jobs , represented a loss of historic proportions . #% Attempts to compromise are always interpreted as weakness by bullies , and China is such a bully . #% Since national governments control taxation policies , social welfare policies , working hours and rates of pay , obviously it is there that the greater part of the responsibility lies . #% I have urged this before , as an alternative to using a quota cut as a mechanism to control supply . #% There are huge sums of money going astray which we could use very effectively in the European Union . #% We must do all in our power to work with the many leaders and spokespersons in the Arab world who feel as strongly as we do in the West about these atrocities . #% Maybe they should train the police in places like Genoa and show them how to react to peaceful protests . #% I personally believe that mutual recognition already works . #% But the forensic clean-up and subsequent intimidation of witnesses and others outraged all of those who genuinely believe in justice , in truth , in the rule of law and democracy itself . #% As long as there is room for improvement in this area , it is incumbent on us , as European legislators , to push forward and bring about a better set of conditions . #% There are quite a lot of Irish vehicles locked with perishable goods , mostly lamb and beef , in refrigerated trucks which now for twelve to fourteen days have been surviving on a small amount of diesel to keep the refrigerators going . #% Finally , the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not , as in the past , interfere in their responsibilities , and that when the Commission takes national governments to task , it can rely on our support . #% On behalf of my group I salute the progress which has been made there . #% The best method of preparing the sector is to put in place a stable , long-term support system for our family farms . #% Indeed , the business directory companies are often established in a different Member State , making it difficult for the victims to seek protection or redress from national authorities . #% There were banner headlines just because the Commission published , a few days ago , a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced . #% They put it better than I can , how children are excluded from EU policy and how laws and policies that the EU makes have a very real impact on children ' s lives , an impact that is different from that on adults . #% All I can say about that is that it is an embarrassment ! #% The Irish people must show some compassion on this issue . #% I ask the Commission to take this on board immediately , before it is too late . #% The dangers associated with incineration in the past have generally been overcome as a result of technological progress . #% I particularly welcome the lower threshold for subsidies and the simplified definitions . #% Commissioner , you have to recognise that vintage McCreevy does not work at European level . #% We hope , therefore , for some limited success at Barcelona to take forward in a responsible way not a free-for-all , but a controlled competitive market . #% I would like the Commission to give us more details as to what is going to be funded by the development fund and how it is going to be managed . #% That should continue to be our primary objective . #% That is the message of my group today . #% Like all Members of this House , I am conscious of the budgetary implications of reform . #% Finally , overall I welcome the role of state aid in supporting the Lisbon objectives . #% Many human rights organisations believe that the plan will worsen conditions for poor rural populations and will certainly increase political violence . #% Everyone accepts now that there is a problem of cod stocks . #% I believe it is entirely proper that Mr Poettering should demand that this issue be dealt with here this week and I would urge the Commission to give the necessary assurance , not only because I agree with the sentiments of Commissioner Patten , but because the world at large wishes to be reassured that there is no dysfunction at the heart of Europe on the question of enlargement . #% In Geneva , and elsewhere , the EU should take every opportunity in a united way to express its displeasure . #% However , it is essential that a mechanism is constructed to deal with the other public health issues and potential outbreaks , and not just the diseases listed in the compromise deal . #% In the process European farmers - the people on whom we rely to produce our food requirements - are in serious financial difficulty , so much so that many of them , even with compensation , will be forced out of business . #% It is based on the existing general systems directives and aims to consolidate 15 directives into one streamlined and simplified piece of legislation , which hopefully will clarify issues of interpretation . #% Equally we can not continue to mortgage our children 's health and heritage . #% As you know , Commissioner , there is information that these weapons are coming from European Union Member States and it seems immoral that this should be allowed to continue . #% This would have jeopardised timetables and led to potential delays for future European programmes . #% Israel must also facilitate the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza . #% The exact date for the transposition in the Member States is missing . #% If we go with the scientific argument , let us have some scientific rigour and be consistent and fair all round . #% To some extent we are dealing with the issue of Box 7 ( A ) in the Irish Sea , which has been closed off at times recently , in cooperation with the fishermen . #% Clearly , there is an urgent need to increase the demand for bioenergy in order to combat climate change and greenhouse gas emissions , to reduce oil dependency and to enhance technology and economic development within the European Union . #% I am interested in seeing whether we have met those targets . #% I also support the rapporteur 's view that the directive should cover wood dust from all types of hardwood . #% We should stop referring to them as Protestants , Catholics or Muslims : they are political extremists . #% We look forward to regular reports from the Commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project . #% I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the ` open method of cooperation ' with ` cooperation ' . #% Specifically , what are the key strategic objectives for the European Union at the forthcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora -- CITES -- to be held in Bangkok , Thailand , from 2 to 14 October 2004 ? #% Let us have debate and discussion . #% The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of , and access to , new modern telecommunication facilities . #% We have relied very much on the leadership of the Commission to push this as a political issue in our country . #% We must look at these figures and put them into context , and it is important for our response to be reasoned and proportionate to the risks and dangers that actually exist . #% Mr President , Taiwan is a sovereign nation and its people have worked hard to become a major economic player in Asia . #% Let us take a fresh look at how better we can plan the long-term survival of agriculture as the profession responsible for food security and safety , taking account of the unique role of farmers as managers of the environment . #% The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable . #% The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line . #% We must err on the side of precaution , not on the side of cost . #% This particular proposal aims to establish a single legal framework to clarify conditions for treating animal by-products . #% I agree that the sooner we can get to a system away from all these complicated measures to assist the regions , the better , just like in the case of the structural funds . #% Our Amendments Nos 4 , 11 and 12 restate the ethics amendment in full . #% I know there are rules governing such a situation but nonetheless , because of the scandalous reports coming from Bosnia and because of the visit and the fact that Parliament will be in recess for the month of August , it is of vital importance that the Commission give some account of the circumstances which appear to have occurred in Bosnia . #% In the past , such an education policy would have correctly placed its emphasis on the need for all students in the EU to complete primary and second-level education . #% There is no better or more suitable substitute in that case , and that must be the test . #% Commissioner Fischler has quite rightly referred to this problem as the ` scourge of the oceans ' . #% 
That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there -- it being a much older foundation . #% Would she also agree , under those circumstances , that there is not the slightest economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant , let alone for seeking to expand its nuclear operations into the future , and that , indeed , the plant should be closed ? #% I do not consider it an abortifacient . #% While recognizing that the problems are very complex , they can only be solved by courageously taking the first decisions on the various items on the agenda . #% Indeed , some Member States have done precisely the opposite of what is needed . #% The one area where I have a slight disagreement with Terry Wynn is over the whole question of export refunds , where I think he went a little bit astray . #% We must always strive to achieve the maximum potential of Europe 's agri-food industry . #% Since scientists first started saving flu virus samples in the early 20th century , an H5N1 influenza has never spread among human beings , so population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus would be universal . #% Many in my own group have raised this question with me . #% Indeed , it is also important that we should seek ways to press the Valencian Government to put a moratorium on new projects , pending the implementation of a satisfactory new law which meets the full requirements of the European Union . #% She will play a critical role in Europe 's recovery and I wish her well with this . #% I believe that it is not the incorporation of the police forces or security agencies of the EU which will solve this problem , but the fullest cooperation between all these agencies now and urgently . #% New trans-European networks , as has already been stated in this House , provide an opportunity for greater mobility and easier access to the market for people with their goods and services . #% The resolution also calls on the EU High Representative and Member States to actively monitor the implementation of recommendations included in the Goldstone report by means of consultation of EU external missions and NGOs in the field and calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with all parties , as well as EU positions in multilateral fora . #% Copyright is there to protect software . #% Authorities are already planning to close down a significant number of currently active landfill sites in Ireland over the next two years . #% I would like to thank Parliament for its assistance in this matter . #% We have created that barrier not just between the people but between ourselves and the media , on whom we depend to sell our message to the people of Europe . #% There must be no cover-up and the problem must be addressed directly by this Parliament and the European Union . #% However , the challenges are on-going and they are worrying . #% While I have always favoured the application of safe and tested genetic research to agriculture , equally its practical application in future must be tempered by inevitable changes to agricultural practices resulting from the unrelated but nonetheless devastating consequences for farmers and consumers resulting from BSE . #% Coordination of national regulators will provide for more flexibility within the single market , which is welcome . #% In particular , in paragraph 6 , we call for an open and candid dialogue . #% Workers ' rights should be guaranteed and defended . #% The use of mobile phones in cars must be legislated for at a European level in the interests of better road safety . #% If not , why not , bearing in mind that this is one of the most controversial issues to be debated by the European Union in many a long day and one in which there is huge public interest ? #% We must ensure that while the economy is buoyant we invest wisely in rail and road networks and in other transport infrastructures . #% While some people may say that it is not the right approach , it is the only way we are going to get any sort of progress for women . #% It is also in line with many of the environmental groups around Europe who feel that this is crucial , as well as the rapporteur 's recommendations . #% Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues , and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns . #% It will do so in a measured , sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases , which , we must not forget , can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators . #% It is a serious problem , it is a problem that is causing people who were pro-European Parliament to turn against this Parliament . #% If we in Europe do not take up market opportunities in the Middle East and elsewhere , our competitors from Australia and New Zealand will ship their animals half way around the world to meet that particular demand . #% That amount of money would finance the needs of a common agricultural policy for the first enlargement . #% Mr President , I would like to join with you and the people of Spain in welcoming the good news you have received . #% This is not just an Irish or a British problem : the grey squirrel has established a firm foothold in Italy and is spreading rapidly northwards across our continent towards France , Germany and Austria , and it is bringing devastation in its wake . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , two months ago , I co-chaired the delegation under the ACP to Haiti and this was probably one of the greatest and most moving experiences of my life . #% The UN General Assembly meeting back in January 1946 , in its first resolution , unanimously called for a commission to make proposals for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and all major weapons of mass destruction . #% I hope that in the next Parliament we will address that issue and decide on the appointment of a special Ombudsman for children . #% And each one of those barriers is invariably justified by invoking the specious but emotive defence of preventing a ` race to the bottom ' . #% Therefore it must be an issue of great personal satisfaction that , having given so much of your particular attention to institutional matters , you should preside over this last session under the new Treaty of Amsterdam . #% Both of them have public deficits that are well beyond the limits agreed under the criteria . #% I agree with the rapporteur that public pressure is needed to ensure adequate expenditure to promote mental health and to prevent mental illness . #% If we look at what has happened in Iraq , and even in Afghanistan , we can see that people still suffer as a result of the use of this weapon long after wars are over . #% I hope you agree with that . #% We need clear implementation of good , humane laws and we will all benefit from them . #% The Union should allocate resources from its annual budget to intercept smugglers as the drugs are introduced to the Union , to control the distribution of substances used in the manufacture of drugs within the Union and to investigate the money-laundering activities of the drug barons . #% Dr Tannock drew to our attention the question of concern about the supply of blood and plasma products for haemophiliacs if the source of supply is outside the Union . #% Finally , at this important juncture , it is vital that all peoples across Europe come together and unite , and understand that , no matter what may divide us in our different ideologies , or in our different political opinions , or , indeed , in our different religions , the things that bring us together , the things that we share , are far more powerful and far greater , in order to effect change for the good , not only in Europe but on the world stage . #% The European Parliament 's position is based on the mistaken view that it is possible to have a ` one size fits all ' approach to Europe 's railways . #% It is an indication of a serious rethink about Europe across the continent . #% Mr President , in the parliamentary tradition from which I come , we were not confined to minutes , we were very often asked at a short notice to run down to the chamber and talk for an hour or so , on every sort of insignificant subject . #% It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in Ireland , cross-border level . #% A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved . #% Something needs to be put in there to guarantee the rights of suspects , because at the end of the day they are suspects : they have not been convicted and therefore their rights should be protected . #% Progress on this lies in the hands of the incoming administration in Turkey , not the EU . #% When we talk in Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation about trying to help developing countries , it has been recognised that cancelling the debt would be one of the most sensible ways of ensuring that we can actually help these countries . #% Like the rest of the House , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report . #% We have all seen the vigour with which Member States have pursued the surveillance of fishing activities so far , and I would like to know the Commission 's view on this question . #% Yet EU farmers are expected to compete with imports from countries where those products are used . #% The Council has instead persisted with its vague commitment to consider the matter when the location of future landfills is chosen . #% The Vienna Summit will review the claims of other applicant states . #% It is clear from the Presidency Conclusions that the financial perspective , as laid down in Berlin in 1999 , is going to be respected in its entirety . #% I think we should reinstate this budget line . #% It must be flexible and market based . #% Those are the reasons for my question . #% 
Both the Irish and British Governments describe them as two sides of the same coin . #% When you declared the vote open on the first vote , we were voting on the second part , because that was what the interpreter told us before you corrected yourself . #% To use his own terms , the nature of the impact is unprecedented , and I think that that is a fair point to make in a country of this kind , which is why - and I mention this just in passing - I really do think that the European Union has to be more visible . #% I also support the provisions in Mr Souchet ' s report which states that we must ensure respect for the European agriculture and food production model . #% It portrays the abuse of alcohol as something that is acceptable in society . #% Mr President , let me start by acknowledging the contribution that my colleague , Mr Moreira Da Silva , has made to the emissions trading directive and all matters relating to Kyoto for so long . #% As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution , so I share the problems that the citizens have . #% It is not an internal matter , it is something that he got involved in when he admittedly , privately , that if Mr Vaclav Klaus became premier again , the Czech Republic 's EU entry chances would be harmed . #% Concrete steps must be taken at the Luxembourg Summit to ensure that the battle against unemployment can be won . #% It is vital that the emergency services , such as ambulances , police and fire services , arrive at the scene of an accident within the first hour -- the golden hour -- after the accident occurs . #% This will cause an increase of heavy road traffic in the Limerick city area . #% May I say in conclusion that since May of this year the European Parliament has the power of codecision on all environmental matters as a result of the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty ? #% The events of the last 10 days have been absolutely terrible for those of us who have held to non-violent and to political traditions over the past 25 years in the most terrible and difficult circumstances . #% May I also take issue with the report 's paragraph 2 : peat is not a wood substitute , it is a fuel/fertiliser in its own right . #% I wonder whether you could confirm that flights are leaving from Strasbourg airport , or if there is any problem ? #% Yes , Kyoto has flaws , but only through working together can these shortcomings be ironed out to the benefit of all . #% Yes , Saddam Hussein has ruled Iraq with an iron fist , he is an evil dictator . #% We have a long way to go in the European Union , but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban . #% We should give serious consideration to any report bearing his name . #% It is important that we all follow suit - from the technical end to us as parliamentarians - as we express ourselves . #% I agree - and have frequently repeated - that in order to have a common agricultural policy it was not necessary to take fish into common ownership . #% That had no precedent ever in European law making . #% If consumers wish to purchase food derived from animals which were not fed on GM feed , then they can do so via the organic route . #% We need to add to that the real threat here for the European Union . #% Mr President , ten years ago over two million children were exposed to the fall-out from Chernobyl . #% Yesterday due to the constraints of time , it was not possible for all of us who wanted to speak to speak . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate . #% But there is also uncertainty in terms of the actual post offices that will be distributed throughout rural Ireland as well as rural Europe . #% The Commission should contact in particular the ministers of health and education in the Northern Ireland Assembly , Ms de Brun and Mr Martin McGuinness . #% Two meetings of Iraqi political leaders have now taken place . #% Madam President , I welcome the opportunity to make a few , but important , points on the Stability and Growth Pact . #% However , a one-size-fits-all policy has proved extremely difficult , as colleagues have said , with 12 out of 15 of the older Member States currently in court for non-transposition or improper transposition of the Nitrates Directive . #% It is very important that this day should not go by without our acknowledging this initiative . #% The citizens of the European Union demand and deserve institutions that deal with their concerns and complaints in a professional and open manner , and which are prepared to admit their failures and bring about adequate redress . #% I shall give you one example : In the innovative computer technology sector in Ireland , there are 100 00 jobs , 62 000 of which are in small and medium-sized enterprises . #% Distributions to investors and capital reductions will be limited in the first two years after takeover , and employees will have access to information on the plans envisioned for their companies . #% ICES says that cod in the North Sea is at its lowest level since 1963 . #% This is not a matter of political bargaining or any special arrangements , as that would be contrary to the Treaty . #% As far as I can see , no distinction has been made , either by the Member States , or by the EU legislator , between horses raised for the purpose of meat production and horses raised for recreational purposes . #% It has achieved as good a balance as one could expect , because I recognise that this is not an easy area in which to balance all the different interests . #% The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins , which will proceed as planned . #% The Iraqi people have suffered too much . #% Mrs Rothe and Mrs Graenitz are quite right to point out that many other policies are taken up by renewable energy , and there is a whole list : environment , agriculture , regional , transport , etcetera . #% Through successive anti-farming policies , we are seeing a dismantling of Irish family farming and , as a result , of our rural communities . #% In conclusion , this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to . #% Firstly , I wish to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy for their cooperation in producing this report . #% The one year extension makes it very clear that not much has changed . #% We should therefore enhance the role of regional and local government in responding to and developing European policy . #% Another wearisome debate dominated by the slow-learning fanatics of a failed and rejected Constitution . #% Thank you , John . #% I would like to thank you and join with all our colleagues in expressing our great joy and support for John Hume and David Trimble in the work they are doing in Northern Ireland . #% According to the World Health Organisation , in 2000 , for the first time in history , the number of overweight people in the world equalled those who were underweight -- more than one billion overweight , 300 million of whom are obese -- with the huge implications this has for morbidity . #% However , in recent times , the value of the euro currency has substantially increased as political and economic stability within the European landscape has re-emerged . #% One thing we speakers from Ireland forgot to say was how much the European Union has contributed to the success we have . #% I am satisfied that everything possible is being done , but nothing can be left to chance . #% Madam President , I believe , as the other speakers have said , that this is a significant formal occasion today , because we have for the first time in plenary the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy . #% . I welcome this report , which formally gives the backing of the European Parliament to continued EU funding for the European Peace Fund until the year 2006 . #% I have three follow-up points in relation to what you have said . #% The EU ' s demonstration programme on integrated management of coastal zones , funded by LIFE , has proved that implementation of integrated coastal zone management results in both economic and environmental benefits . #% I would appreciate it if you would consider me as having been present when it comes to the Minutes . #% I regret very much the apparent absence of the Council of Ministers , although I may be wrong , from this important debate . #% The authority and success of the United Nations peacekeeping units was not based on the strength of their arms but on the moral clout of the UN , and this , in turn , was based on the acceptance by the conflicting parties of the political neutrality of the UN and its genuine wish to secure the peace . #% We now need immediate and well-focused action to restore consumer confidence and eradicate the BSE disease . #% We have a chance to get it right for the developing world and the EU sugar industry , but the current proposals are not the solution to this dilemma . #% In the British legal system , which is the common law system , the rules of evidence were established over 322 years - and yet we are going to bring in common rules of evidence willy nilly ? #% Self-harm is also emphasised because of its increasing incidence . #% 
Despite around half a century of commercial operation of nuclear reactors , the solution to the long-term management of nuclear waste remains unsolved . #% We are all aware of the challenges that lie ahead for the European Union both economically and socially . #% For that , we need a legal base . #% Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that ? #% How do you intend to improve the evaluation of the impact assessment in terms of cost ? #% I believe that countries with a restrictive policy should relax it , but not on the condition that we tighten our system and restrict the access of our consumers in our countries to vitamin and food supplements . #% This House has demanded urgency on a statute for its own Members ; it must treat its own staff with no less urgent respect . #% Minister , is that answer not a pitiful and cowardly cop-out ? #% They can be bestowed selectively , denied , or even take back . #% I understand that many people have deep reservations about aspects of what this final statute may contain . #% My question does not just refer to the Mobotu funds that are spread throughout Europe and lying dormant in banks or are perhaps being used by undesirable types . #% Sexual and reproductive health and rights need to be acknowledged and furthered in Europe and at a global level . #% I am curious . #% The issue of taxation is an issue for Member States alone . #% . I would like to thank the Presidency for that reply . #% Thirdly , and I suppose most importantly , if we find that some data has been misused , what comeback do we have ? #% To combat drug abuse there must be a partnership approach put in place involving police authorities , social groups , voluntary organisations and local authorities . #% It is time to remember that . #% Mr President , the hearings in Parliament and the confirmation vote which we have later today on the president , vice-president , and Executive Board members for the Central Bank mark for this House the last significant step in the beginning of a very significant and historic enterprise for Europe . #% He emphasises the cost of the common agricultural policy . #% There is no justification or room for equivocation . #% We see this in its response to legitimate international concerns about its human rights record . #% Such information can be easily made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels . #% What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance ? #% Mr President , I speak today on behalf of my group with regard to the proposal put before this House . #% The emphasis on information dissemination in ALTENER II is very important indeed , and I look forward , if it is available yet , to looking at the Agores Centre on the Worldwide Web which is clearly intended to bring together all sorts of information on renewable energy so that everyone can look it up and can be kept up-to-date . #% Commissioner Mandelson 's decision to impose anti-dumping duties on certain synthetic fabrics is welcome so far as it goes , but often such fabrics are then further processed in China to give them added value , thereby avoiding the anti-dumping duties . #% The Irish aquaculture sector , for example , now accounts for over 30 % of total fish production , reflecting global trends . #% Happily now we can discuss them . #% How can our views be taken into consideration when we are debating a report which has already been decided on by Council ? #% Is this not a matter best left to Member States ? #% What action has the Commission taken to ensure that the public is fully informed with regard to these rules and their rights ? #% However , some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process . #% All Member States are represented in the Council of Ministers , the European Commission and the European Parliament . #% I am encouraged that there are some developments and possibly we will get some breakthrough . #% Children under three years of age can not read and even children up to the age of six are not really capable of reading and even if they are , are they really competent to make decisions on this ? #% I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon . #% Inshore fishermen are very vulnerable to the implications of the designation of Special Areas of Conservation . #% This should be of particular concern . #% Last November they came and met the political leaders of the groups in this Parliament and held open consultations with them on the agenda that they proposed to put forward during their presidency . #% In fact , only one Member spoke and he did not address the issue of Northern Ireland . #% What have the Council and the Committee on Fisheries done ? #% A properly resourced EU action programme , like Europe Against Cancer and Europe Against AIDS , is needed to raise awareness about the disease and coordinate activities against it . #% When the people who oppose this Treaty and have opposed other treaties say that this will override national law , this issue has already been decided . #% The EU and ACP must reaffirm their partnership by strengthening democracy and respect for human rights , especially the rights of women . #% Mr President , I am pleased that today 's debate has been framed as a joint debate on issues of food and feed safety . #% It is easy to build the structure of a building to house an institute of technology . #% We can not sweep under the carpet things that we believe and hold true to us , because in this fight , it is absolutely essential that Parliament stands up to this . #% Concerning the multinational force , it seems that Canada is perfectly willing to lead such a force but someone is blocking it . #% The proposal is important because improving the conditions and criteria under which passengers should be reimbursed and assisted in the event of being denied boarding , cancellation or long delays is something that must be welcomed . #% The problem for my Group with the compromise package now proposed by the Council is where the latter insists on extending controls by slaughterhouse employees to include pigs and calves . #% What has happened to those people ? #% It can be taken from you , but the freedom that allows us to have the passions that burn in our hearts and souls must always be preserved and protected . #% Anyone who has any knowledge of Albania will know that the people of that country are suffering very much already . #% Cameroon is very high in the Corruption Index kept by Transparency International , and in the Republic of Congo , there has been horrific exploitation of some sections of the population , notably the pygmy people , although a new law has just been passed and people will wait to see what this does to protect indigenous people . #% Nothing could be further from the truth , indeed the least developed countries have very little to gain from such a gesture . #% Such bureaucracy is unacceptable and must be cut back in these times of economic crisis , not enhanced . #% If there is a depletion of stocks it is not Irish fishermen but some greedy neighbours in other Member States who are responsible for it . #% We know that FMD has been around for 400 years so modern farm practices can not be blamed for this virulent disease , but the mobility of animals today gives rise to greater risk and faster contamination . #% When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning , we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration . #% In addition , we should certainly be researching into restrictions on the marketing and use on the European market of dangerous substances to which newborn babies , children , pregnant women , elderly persons , workers and other high-risk sections of the population are heavily exposed . #% I say that particularly because of the commitment of the Irish presidency to job creation and , hopefully , also to rural development . #% I have one small , further request to the Commissioner . #% It has been suggested that the small European countries lack the resources and the ability to undertake the onerous task of presiding over the affairs of the Union and that the present system of rotating the six-month presidencies should be abolished . #% Thirdly , the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States . #% Particular reference has been made to the importance of different bodies in the Commission working closely together in the cultural field in order to pull the strings together . #% 
As rapporteur , I was very disappointed that we lost these legal framework amendments . #% I am asking him today if he is prepared to at least put that item on the agenda for consideration by the Council so that the matter can be progressed . #% Who will give us the right to speak on behalf of all of those people if we use our time and energy trying to get one over on a neo-Liberal , neo-Conservative , Communist -- or whatever -- approach ? #% ` Unilateral trade disarmament ' is unacceptable . #% So we have to wonder just how committed the Irish Government is to tackling the problem if it continues to support the Council 's very watered-down amendments . #% To reiterate , what is important is that , by adopting this directive , we are blocking the use of HFC-134a , which has a global warming potential 10 times higher than HFC 152a . #% Unfortunately , even if all these extensive repairs and the construction of an effective and secure shelter for reactor 4 can be completed quickly , there will be no guarantees and , in my view , no question but the whole project will still be environmentally unsafe because the technology to render the dismantled reactor safe , on the one hand , and to eliminate the radioactive waste , on the other , does not yet exist . #% We need to bring protection and production together in the management of our forests in order to ensure the viability of their environmental , social and economic functions . #% Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to come back and respond briefly to the debate so far . #% Even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong , for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair . #% In the CAP reform farmers were forced to swap guaranteed prices for income aids and much reduced guarantees . #% The Islamic world is outraged , and rightly so , at the genocidal policies being pursued in Iraq . #% There is a requirement to have a dry dock basin available for the dismantling of these ships , but it is unlikely that they can be dealt with in 180 days and indeed there is no dry dock basin available for the recycling of these ships . #% The powerful financial speculators rejected it , as did powerful governments , as not feasible . #% I may not always agree with him but as a working Member of this Parliament he is a fine example and always has been . #% I was assured personally last night by Commissioner Verheugen , the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice-President of the Commission , that -- and I quote him with his permission : ` If the new regulation enters into force , I will propose to the Commission to withdraw the infringement procedures against Austria and Denmark . ' #% Commissioner , could you please tell us how quickly we will be able to resolve this issue of different eligibility criteria for different benefits ? #% From the outset we have considered that `` mad cow disease '' is a Community problem and should therefore be fully financed by the Community . #% The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union . #% The sale and distribution of dangerous weapons including , in particular , landmines must cease . #% We want to work with you as a reliable partner for Europe now and in the future and that requires respectful dialogue . #% Mr President , the report presented to us today by my colleague , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , is comprehensive in its analysis of the activities of EURES over the period 1998 to 1999 and constructive in relation to the proposal he makes for the future activities of this network . #% I have said that the job losses were very considerable . #% Blackmailing threats of resignation indicate a weakness which is a running sore already and will develop into a festering boil . #% We have been able to put across important points despite working quickly . #% The veterinary experts have told me that they are quite appalled at the apathy of the government in this field . #% Research and innovation are central to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , so investment in R&D is the best possible response . #% Equally I welcome the fact that the new Treaty will define the powers between the European Commission itself and the individual Member States of the Union . #% These must be based on EU risk evaluation procedures and the opinions of relevant scientific committees , which also allow for peer review . #% We await the Commission 's review of the operation of the emissions trading regime next June to keep the cynics and the ` I told you so 's ' at bay and to maintain the credibility of the emissions trading scheme . #% You can not rehabilitate people if many of them have never been habilitated in the first place . #% The Commission has confirmed that this will not happen . #% It is my view that citizenship derives in the first instance from a sense of responsibility which comes from within a moral framework - I am not talking specifically about a religious framework , but a moral framework of how one sees the world and one 's place in the world . #% We can not give a signal from this house that we are not concerned with fundamental economic dynamics in the European Union . #% 30 % of all scheduled flights in Europe take off late 45 % of the time . #% Most of our group will support it , as indeed most of Parliament will support it . #% Policy which facilitates relocation thus damages social cohesion . #% What happens if that person is unfortunate enough to die unexpectedly ? #% Most financial institutions that lend money are in business to maximise profits . #% I really think it is very tokenistic to ask for some aid programmes for the area . #% In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense , without any real negotiation or discussion . #% That is deplorable . #% Already burdened by huge amounts of EU red tape , many SMEs with limited manpower simply do not have the capacity or time to go through the current application processes . #% We also have to examine ourselves . #% At the same time , we recognise that there has been some movement in this area . #% I am sure that everyone is as relieved as I am that they were released and have now left Afghanistan and returned to their homes . #% There has also been a recent departure of a Commission official , Mr Curry , to the board of BNFL . #% In this I am convinced that the EU must take the initiative . #% I know it is not a negotiating state , but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states . #% The European Commission , of course , analyses very carefully all action plans on employment which are forwarded to us on an annual basis by the EU Member States so as to ensure that comprehensive and streamlined measures to promote equality in our society are supported . #% Could the President-in-Office tell us what is in that package ? #% I would refer him to the area near my place of birth , Trawsfynydd in North Wales . #% People in need of such temporary action do not necessarily meet the conditions of refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention . #% What I am suggesting is that you , as President-in-Office of the Council , have a responsibility , under the various conventions I refer to , to ensure that these monies are returned to the various former colonies . #% We would have liked to see a complete ban on these fragrances , but unfortunately we did not get support within the Committee for that . #% This is just one more example of the grave human rights situation in Northern Ireland . #% More films were made in Ireland last year than in all previous years put together . #% The operation of the national security law was certainly a problem and there was a serious problem concerning long-term political prisoners . #% Today , over 200 million of the world 's children may be working illegally , denying them an education and childhood and putting their physical and mental health at risk . #% We must look at other possibilities , including partition and transmutation . #% It is equally important to bear in mind that there can not be economic development in a modern economy without a strong social dimension . #% Our government has signed the Aarhus Convention , which makes our government look good among its nation peers , but our government is one of the few signatories that refuse to ratify it and to give it effect . #% How can anybody have any control over what they do or what they bring back ? #% We insist on such a trade-off because , to reiterate the point , this Parliament wants new tax but not more tax . #% Is that what we have ended up with at the table now , in giving too much too soon ? #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Swedish presidency on its success and also express my regret that the Irish referendum result overshadowed many of their achievements , particularly in the field of enlargement . #% 
The directive on air conditioning systems in motor vehicles was the second arm of the package of the two proposals to emerge from the Council 's first reading on the recommendation of my predecessor as rapporteur , Mr Goodwill . #% There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment . #% That can not happen if we do not know the statistics of the agricultural industry . #% Now reductions must be obtained on texting and email connections . #% In my view , insurance companies should not fear the entry of other European competitors into their national markets . #% The common position was developed in tandem with the proposed NEC directive and represents a coherent and balanced approach to achieving environmental objectives over time . #% My delegation will vote for this directive . #% It is an indication of the concern of this particular group for the problem we are discussing . #% Mr President , I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this historic debate . #% The only solution that can achieve lasting peace in the region is a socialist Israel , alongside a socialist Palestine , in which borders are mutually agreed by both communities and are part of a democratic socialist confederation of the Middle East . #% What a scandal this is , considering that USD 300 billion have been obscenely wasted on weapons of mass destruction and war and lost in corruption over that time . #% Now , the Union 's institutions will fall within the scope of this fundamental rights protection system . #% Well , I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information , and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it , then we will have bad decisions . #% This is the first time the Commission has submitted an annual report based on a complete year of operation of the Cohesion Fund and it is the first time this Parliament has had the opportunity of examining how the Cohesion Fund has been implemented in the beneficiary Member States . #% We should not automatically presume . #% This is a very serious matter , for the use of selective fishing gear occupies a prominent place in both the UN Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the FAO code of conduct for responsible fishing . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single currency on 1 January is a positive step on the road to European integration . #% I make the point because this document was stuffed into my hands coming in the door . #% I thought you might be interested . #% It is therefore appropriate that we should continue to monitor developments which could in any way undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong and threaten fundamental freedoms . #% It is inexcusable that this reference to the family has been removed . #% Already we have seen a generation of children with grotesque and life-threatening malformations . #% . The Parliament has voted to eliminate unsubstantiated claims on foods and drinks , especially products marketed to children . #% Open markets and product mobility increase the possibility of the spread of disease . #% The United Nations has an opportunity - as is made clear by the inspectors who have reported to it this week - to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein if they are given enough time and providing Saddam Hussein pro-actively cooperates with them . #% They had not informed Parliament that this demonstration was going to take place yesterday . #% I am sure that the Irish government has agreed to the broad principle of the separation of infrastructure and operation and has pledged to pursue the restructuring of Irish railways to achieve this goal . #% Personally I do not have any difficulties with the morning-after pill . #% This is what I ask the European Parliament to take on as a duty : monitor the working of this treaty . #% That has to be a cause for concern in terms of misleading consumers . #% I would like to see more money for research but there is no bottomless bank account . #% We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure , training and everything else . #% . The Verts/ALE Group welcomes the fact that the report by Mr Titley on an EU code of conduct on arms exports is a major improvement on his previous reports on this issue . #% In December 2000 European Union leaders agreed a set of Treaty reforms in Nice which they considered would be the best procedure for bringing about enlargement . #% Indeed , as Mr Tappin rightly points out , small and medium-sized industries naturally tend to be the norm in smaller countries . #% Why , therefore , is it the case that we in Parliament are not looking at that ? #% I look to their support and cooperation in this regard . #% We are told we should be afraid of the danger lurking behind us , and that things are happening that we do not know about , when the reality is that every single decision taken is accountable . #% However , it also saddens me to say that there have been many times when I have listened to the debate on this issue both in the committee and here in the Chamber and it seems that we are totally unconnected with the reality of what is happening outside these walls . #% Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill , maim , abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims . #% Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa . #% Nevertheless I believe in free trade . #% Think of what that could do in the developing world . #% This legislation rolls out the proposal made by Airbus at an Airbus-hosted meeting in Toulouse on 29 and 30 September and 1 October 1997 , effectively commercially sponsored legislation . #% Mr President , I very much regret that this will be my last speech to this Parliament , having been here for the past 25 years . #% The direct aid will solve a lot of the problems we are talking about . #% in writing . - Many recent events have shown us the importance of consumer confidence and this is , in part , borne from proper laws to protect consumers in the marketplace . #% This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House . #% Mr President , very hearty congratulations to Mrs Rothe for an excellent report . #% But we need to protect the consumer from the cowboy operators , those who engage in sharp practice , and the rip-off merchants . #% We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission . #% In Europe we can not allow our food supply to be outsourced . #% Have we ever had a resolution before us which was so clear in terms of the abuses that we are seeking to have addressed by the European Union ? #% I am sure the President 's heart is in the right place when it comes to promoting rural tourism . #% My proposal , as rapporteur , to adopt a single environment-linked legal base as the only means of achieving legal certainty , did not obtain the required qualified majority . #% That is especially so in a country like mine , Ireland , which has the strongest economy in Europe while its health service is inadequate and people are put at risk because they can not get the basic health services they need . #% To imagine you can force this European political identity on people by adopting some sort of system like this is ludicrous . #% Madam President , I do not wish to delay proceedings but having heard both speakers before me with regard to the problems associated with the amendments and so on , I propose to the House that we refer this report back to the committee until such time as they come up with a proper text that we can all accept . #% It is time to react ! #% The impossibility of distinguishing these proteins and bone spicules , which do not pose a TSE risk from proteins of ruminant origin which could contain BSE-carrying prions , resulted in a number of high-profile , extremely costly , wasteful and unnecessary withdrawals from shipments and , more controversially , beet-based animal feed , owing to this harmless and unavoidable adventitious presence of non-ruminant proteins . #% This is highlighted by the ongoing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear installations , including Sellafield , to which many people have referred during the earlier debate . #% However , the current cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and this is taking the parties even further away from a negotiated settlement . #% The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process . #% For the purpose of agreement and the speedy implementation of this regulation and hopefully to avoid a lengthy conciliation process , the use of common OIE criteria would be appropriate . #% But whatever honeyed words are attached to the conclusions of the procedure , the bottom line is that junior doctors will not secure benefits for a period of nine years at least . #% Would you not accept that dealing with problems that threaten their safety and wellbeing in a coordinated and comprehensive way will help convince them of the values of Europe ? #% 
Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy . #% I for one will not lend the veneer ... #% The conclusion of that survey clearly demonstrated that costs for consumers of transferring money from one country to another in Europe are still too high . #% The implementation of the Social Policy Action Programme 2000-2005 as published by the Commission will also help in combating social exclusion . #% In retrospect , the last enlargement , without deepening , was premature . #% The use of Iraq 's oil revenues must also play a key part in the actual reconstruction of Iraq , but any use of such monies must be undertaken in the best interests of the Iraqi people , who must play a role in any such decisions as fully and as early as possible . #% By this means we should begin to decouple ourselves from what has been a very difficult , but useful experience , but one that remains , unfinished as it is , deeply embarrassing and complicated as we have seen recently by the deplorable choices of Dr Martin Bangemann . #% There is no way around this . #% The objectives of reconciliation and peace , establishing contacts between the two communities and forging links between them have an impeccable record in the fund . #% - I wish to state the reasons why I felt obliged to abstain on the final vote , even though , in common with other Members , I am totally in favour of the protection of fundamental freedoms and rights , and with ensuring that future social developments can be taken account of . #% It is vital to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance and aid to Gaza without delay . #% With the amount of goodwill present , there should now be an opportunity for a specific article in the new treaty which the Dutch Government will - we hope - be bringing in under its presidency , to ensure that the rights and freedoms of children are fully and individually enshrined therein . #% Secondly , on the question of transparency and openness -- and people often speak about transparency without fully realising or understanding what it means -- the most transparent thing Parliament , the institutions and the Presidency can do is to deliver on their commitments . #% It is hard to see how it will lead to a reform of the Palestinian Authority . #% We must find ways in each case , as it arises , to accommodate both these principles . #% If we just did that , however , and failed to look at energy efficiency and environmental protection , we would end up with a situation which was far worse than the present one . #% Our committee is not a court of law ; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability , given the evidence available . #% I urge the Commissioner to ask the authorities to take up the offer of assistance by the UK to interview witnesses and examine pre - and post-trial evidence that was rejected in his appeal . #% The stores down there are empty . #% Following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August . #% We have seen too much abuse of this loose definition of `` self-employed '' in other areas of work . #% Madam President , as we will have a statement on Bosnia tomorrow , we wish to withdraw the objection . #% We have to underline once again that this is the policy of the Parliament ; the Committee on Budgetary Control has called for it , with the support of Parliament , on many occasions . #% We all wish you well . #% It is essential that we learn from past experience and insist on openness and transparency . #% In my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development , which , as you said , Commissioner , unlocked the potential of rural areas . #% We enter this new round of talks with the benefits of hindsight and in the knowledge that the United States , in reaching its negotiating position , will have , as in the past , researched the hidden agenda of establishing ways to deviate from that agreement to help its own producers , while at the same time demanding that Europe adhere rigidly to its requirements . #% In conclusion , I would like the Commission to ban mass medication of the public water supply . #% Mr President , I want to welcome the cross-party support for this debate , initiated by our group and spearheaded by Mrs Todini , on the complex and disturbing issue of violence against children . #% President Lamfalussy of the EMI spoke to Parliament 's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs on Monday and presented the annual report . #% Article 5 ( 1 ) of the Commission text proposes that the penalties for abusing a child under the age of 10 years should be more severe . #% There was also no time for a technology assessment or for a study on the impact on the internal market . #% Has the negotiating mandate set out in the Council conclusions and the Luxembourg Agreement changed ? #% However , the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long , and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up . #% There was an assumption that the outcome was a fait accompli . #% Mr President , the Treaty of Nice is dead and must not be given the kiss of life . #% The Council have used creative accounting to find EUR 420 million . #% This goes some way towards ensuring that in methods of investigation , for example , there is some sort of standard . #% The real route to cohesion was equality of access to funding , but that was denied to Northern Ireland , while the south of Ireland benefited to the tune of over EUR 2 billion for its infrastructure . #% That would greatly help . #% Madam President , I fully support the rapporteur 's excellent proposal to split the financial framework programmes into two specific programmes . #% So let us make it simple . #% I thank you for the honour you bring to our country in that regard . #% I answered : number one is waste , number two is waste , number three is waste , number four is waste and number five is waste . #% I particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original Commission proposal on the DCECI . #% The timeframe for use of this fund is limited and no time must be lost in providing the services needed . #% There is full support for the statute and I welcome the fact that the consultation is going to take place from the bottom up , involving everybody in a decent , fair , upright , open and democratic fashion . #% Will the Commissioner investigate the case thoroughly with a view to instigating Court of Justice proceedings against the UK in this case ? #% We can not say that if we manage our own coasts , that is sufficient . #% The Spring Summit will also focus on the Lisbon Agenda and I welcome the presidency 's proposal to give renewed impetus to the reform goals agreed at Lisbon . #% Could this outbreak have been prevented ? #% Secondly , implementing a coordinated and sustained effort by donor governments gives rise for concern . #% Again according to the report of Cáirde , in Ireland almost 3 000 people are HIV positive , and a further 3 000 people are affected when one considers the family members and children of those who are HIV-positive . #% This latter point is of particular importance to me and my constituents in the Province of Leinster . #% What we have seen in Palestine over the last 30 years has been a failure to meet any one of those four criteria . #% In essence , what the report proposes is improved quality of life for all , at all stages of life , and a recognition that policy decisions and legislation enacted should contribute to that core objective . #% However , in terms of the scheme of things , it is the responsibility of this House itself to determine the nature of its travel allowance system , whereas for the Statute it is the responsibility of others to ensure that this House gets its act together in time for Vienna . #% Climate change is one of the top priorities for Europe , as well as for the rest of the world . #% This Task Force seeks to promote greater flexibility in education , training and innovation , encourages greater flexibility on the part of workers and companies , and removes disincentives to employment . #% For that reason , I am quite keen on the idea the Commission recently mentioned -- and perhaps the Commissioner might listen to what I have to say -- in relation to ` motorways of the sea ' . #% That is why the issue must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviation . #% It is on an island and has its own docks . #% I did so in particular because the other two sets of amendments ( Committee and Purvis ) would be next to be voted on and seemed likely at that stage to be carried . #% There is need for a full review of the technical standards to ensure that safety standards are fully met whilst at the same time aircraft that are satisfactorily functioning from every point of view are not lost to our fleets . #% If the Commission is intent upon developing ` motorways of the sea , ' promoting sea transport and establishing shipping links as part of the trans-European network , sea-faring countries such Ireland must be given equal treatment . #% Could I suggest that it is important that we do not reduce the Constitution to its detail , that we do not damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is just a tidying up exercise , because the spirit of the Constitution is greater than the sum of its parts . #% 
Let us hope that this is not another such occasion . #% Parliament also has to insist that the Council and Commission must do more than just send recommendations : they have to state clearly that the Colombian government puts into danger the relations between the EU and Colombia . #% I would assure her that the presidency will be very supportive of the line taken by her . #% From an Irish perspective , I welcome the recent support given by the Commission for Ireland to continue to receive cohesion funds until the year 2003 . #% Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration , asylum , refugees , displaced persons and European visas . #% Where proper parallel funding has not been made available by a Member State , the Commission 's inspection role and its ability to recover funds need to be strengthened . #% The actual requirement on the European Commission was to bring forward a publication which would show production and investment figures in an indicative programme . #% I am also conscious , as somebody who still has not managed to crack this system , of the difficulty for all of us in legislating for such a volatile and dynamic medium . #% We waste # 150 million each year by having 11 sessions here in Strasbourg . #% If a country is rich , powerful and developed it can be blessed with such natural resources , but it seems that the fate of a poor country with such gifts is exploitation , strife and international meddling . #% The extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) to the aviation sector may be the best way forward to limiting these emissions and to ensuring that aviation , like all other sectors , contributes to reducing harmful greenhouse gases . #% The President-in-Office here this morning declared that the Council was surprised at the events of the last two weeks . #% The political and economic reunification of our continent is a victory for the spirit of Europe , one of which we should all be proud . #% It very quickly became apparent that the trampling of the pilgrims ' feet and not divine intervention had , in fact , been essential to protect that particular ecosystem . #% Since this period , Burundi has lurched from crisis to crisis , with many thousands of people losing their lives in the process . #% The Brazilian Ambassador did not lobby me . #% We , however , need to make progress on our priorities . #% These alternatives to cadmium are what we really need , and they already exist . #% in writing . - I am voting for this resolution to reject the health claim that adding the natural fatty acid DHA to baby food contributes to the normal visual development of infants for a number of reasons . #% I paid the price financially but that is not really what is at issue . #% I also believe that an international peace conference that does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists in the Middle East will not succeed , nor will it get off the ground . #% As far as I am aware , arrangements with the Isle of Man and the similar jurisdictions mentioned by the honourable Member were dealt with at the time of accession and are not presenting any difficulties . #% Throughout this decade we have never had unemployment less than 10 % of the labour force . #% Mr President , I wish the Danish presidency well in the run-up to the EU Summit this week in Brussels . #% In addition , just last month the Food Supplements Directive , which had a positive list of allowed substances , was found to be illegal by the Advocate General in Luxembourg . #% In particular , the total objection to having a regionalised policy within the common fisheries policy is incorrect . #% We have acted , but I believe that it is the citizens , in their determination , and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you , Commissioner , to give us the legal power to ban it . #% For almost all of the first half of this year - I do not have the dates on me now - I was accredited with not voting , despite the fact that I knew that I was here and voted . #% In my constituency of Northern Ireland , 98 % of all companies can be classified as SMEs . #% This Parliament can help by raising the issue and also potentially by providing finance , as stated in the motion for a resolution . #% -- Mr President , over the past 300 years , 10 influenza pandemics have occurred among humans . #% I do not support the cloning of human beings . #% If the Court of Justice or any other court in the European Union is using it to bind Member States , individuals or associations to an interpretation of that charter , then they are incorrect in law , in justice and in legal interpretation . #% When the CFP is revised next year it is essential that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine habitat be made its primary and overriding objective , and the only way to do this is to implement a rigorous and comprehensive precautionary approach to fisheries management . #% I jest not . #% As the author of Parliament 's most recent human rights report , I was pleased to see almost all of the thematic issues raised in Parliament 's report dealt with in this document too , reflecting consistency of thought and priority . #% I am referring specifically to firebreak vaccination . #% We know there is a very low level of harmonisation in this field , which is of vital importance for the single market . #% In Ireland we have quite recently introduced recycling and there has been a very positive response from the general public . #% For the reasons already stated , and in particular because of Ireland 's dependency on its agri-food sector , I appeal to colleagues to support the existing derogation for Ireland and the United Kingdom to allow the description ` milk chocolate ' within the marketing territory of both countries . #% This legislation is a fascinating case study for anyone interested in the institutional decision-making processes of the European Parliament . #% In conclusion , the future for our single market must lie in a car taxation system which is visibly CO2 modulated , but without central prescription . #% For that reason the time has come for this Parliament to consider whether or not it can recreate direct access to Strasbourg . #% Perhaps the President-in-Office could reassure us on this point . #% It is pathetic that the World Health Organisation and other countries cooperate with this embargo on Taiwan . #% How often have we said in this House that the growth of SMEs is the key to fighting unemployment in the EU and indeed in our regional policy programmes we have strengthened our support for SMEs in recognition of this potential . #% I am not interested in promoting European Union decision-making founded on institutional stalemate . #% Mr President , in complimenting Mr Souchet on his work , I express my disappointment and concern with regard to the Commission proposal to reduce subsidies worth EUR 145 million per year to the food and drink industry . #% This European Food Authority can work with the 15 governments of the Union , in an advisory and preventative capacity , to guarantee that food products from farm to table comply with the highest public health standards . #% I just wish to let the House know that an intergroup on East Timor has now been set up , and people who are concerned about the Indonesian occupation of East Timor should get involved in the intergroup . #% Mr President , with acute drug-related deaths standing at 7,000 to 8,000 a year , my Group will be supporting very strongly the report by Mr Oostlander and the fight against illicit drug trafficking . #% We are moving on to a debate on avian influenza and market support measures . #% Is this another aspect of the policy of non-cooperation ? #% We need to create proper conditions for full and stable employment to improve quality and productivity at work and labour market cohesion . #% You have to make societal changes as well . #% Over the years , as the number of farms was reduced and farmers became more efficient , food obviously became more available to the poor who could buy it at a lower cost . #% There will be risks , but we have to explain to our people why we can not do other than proceed . #% Finally , I ask the media to examine their conscience and ask : why now , why not then ? #% Members have tabled questions to be answered by the Commission , they sit here while you allow supplementary after supplementary and let Commissioners run on at will and our questions are not reached . #% Look at the last century : the first half of it was marked by the worst conflict the world had ever seen : two world wars and millions of people dead and killed . #% It is up to the Commission to propose it in time . #% I want to know whether there are any possible public health consequences from the use of depleted uranium shells in the location to which I have referred to today . #% TOTAL , the French state-owned oil company , has been active in Burma for many years and there have been allegations that it has used forced labour , including child labour , in its work . #% deputising for the author . - President-in-Office , thank you for the response to the question . #% It has been ignored for too long , it is an absolute outrage and the Government in Khartoum can not be allowed to get away with it any longer . #% We have good reason to believe that Abu Omar was in fact tortured in Egypt . #% 
For some of them it has been , and continues to be , difficult . #% You may be curious but you are not going to work on that subject . ' #% Commissioner Byrne 's White Paper on food safety sets the ground rules and parameters within which the practical application of genetic research impacts on public health and the environment , and I have no doubt the vigilance of Parliament is a further safeguard . #% You have all of us behind you and you have the tools to ensure that you can act both legally and effectively . #% In relation to the issue at hand I thank the honourable Member for his understanding . #% Disabled people of all nationalities were exterminated for the simple reason that they were disabled . #% Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work . #% The most important issues that will be addressed this year will be the reform of the EU decision-making procedures , so that the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% They said very glibly ` textiles is the answer ' , but it has to be pointed out that the US is one of the most protectionist countries in textiles in the world . #% We all have to condemn the assassinations that took place in Papua on 10 November . #% I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members . #% The European Research Council , for example , has done much to support individual scientists . #% I should like to put on record that it was considered , but without much debate at all , and the Members of the Legal Affairs Committee were never even advised that Parliament 's legal opinion to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety was that the dual legal base would not withstand a challenge before the ECJ . #% 80 % of all the stocks we know of are inside the 200-mile limit . #% During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures . #% My Group very much disagrees with the procedure and the result of the conciliation . #% I am pleased to support Mr Hegyi 's report , but regret that due to the application of Rule 45 ( 2 ) , I was denied the opportunity to debate it . #% I believe we should be asking both sides in this conflict to have this courage and show their leadership . #% We have gone to the edge of the precipice but we have not gone over . #% There is an urgent need for immediate action . #% I believe that NATO has basically ignored international law in the action it has taken and that proper efforts were not made to find a peaceful solution . #% I would add one word of caution . #% Looking at what was voted through here in Parliament , we talked about research being subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State , but what if it turns out that a Member States does not have a legal framework in place ? #% Mr President , everyone agrees with the objectives of this proposed directive . #% We need proper studies that are independent and will give us the whole story and it is the responsibility of the Commission to carry that out . #% That is not what we want . #% First of all , the PPE-DE Group will be having a free vote on paragraph 3 , as requested . #% To be parochial , I wish to thank the Irish Permanent Representation for their tremendous work . #% We are now facing another human catastrophe in Africa . #% In the EU , we know how much more we can achieve by pooling our resources and setting common standards and by tackling together environmental problems which have cross-border implications . #% Share this process with us as well , not because we want to interfere with your right to make the final call , but because we too are players and we can not be left to one side or not get documents till the eve of a debate . #% Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ? #% I wish to say , firstly , that we should leave this discussion to another time , because it should be debated . #% Obviously something must be done . #% Finally , let us not forget astronomy and space exploration . #% In particular , the issue of sanctions to be imposed at an EU level flies totally in the face of subsidiarity and competences of national governments . #% The question is , can the European Union find a flexible way , through a joint action , of responding in a coordinated manner to any future situations that might arise where persons are temporarily in need of international protection ? #% In my opinion , this is questioning the credibility of the large number of Members of this Parliament who felt it necessary to go to Iraq because Parliament itself would not send an official delegation . #% I believe we must have access to the single market . #% Global leader in military power he may be , but he is a global dunce in citizenship and respect for others . #% in writing . - This is a very pertinent issue , and I strongly support the group line in focusing on Early Years Learning . #% Although there are difficulties with the two directives and liberalization , it is part of creating Europe and lower prices do benefit people . #% On Amendment 226 , which deals with a code of conduct on advertising of foods aimed at children , I voted against as I do not think this amendment is strong enough in its wording to get Member States to address the urgent concerns about increasing obesity levels in children . #% The Greek Government tried valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe , but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts , this objective could not be secured . #% What we also have to do is make it possible for them to get to that position . #% The 1999 recommendation requires an update within five years of it being published that takes into account ongoing research . #% I would very much like to welcome Commissioner Wallström 's comments . #% In 2009 , I became the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in the town of Dundalk . #% Mr President , the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice is taking place at a defining moment in our relationship with the European Union . #% We know that the US Government and the European Union could not reach agreement in the Netherlands before Christmas on setting a timetable for the reduction of the use of greenhouse gases . #% Madam President , as you were informed earlier this week , I was in Scotland protesting against the Trident nuclear submarine base there and I was arrested . #% We feel a thorough examination of each asylum demand and a decision should be based on each individual case . #% But we must all reflect on the key practical procedure being used to streamline the enlargement of the Union . #% For my part I believe that Ireland would be very reluctant to become part of a defence alliance still committed in certain circumstances to the use of nuclear weapons . #% It is therefore important that the conservation and development communities should work together with indigenous populations and civil society on this shared agenda in order to address the underlying causes of poverty and biodiversity loss . #% Among the most important goals achieved is the entry of women into the labour market . #% I agree that we need an appropriate EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds which will prompt them to locate in the EU , rather than offshore , and provide the benefits of a common European passport through mutual recognition . #% The PPE-DE Group fully supports the emissions trading scheme and our objectives under Kyoto and agrees with the need to keep downward pressure on every one of the 25 Member States to meet their targets in relation to greenhouse gases , as agreed under Kyoto . #% I hope we can take this excellent report on board . #% In short , can you give us an assurance that you will make an effort to have the fishermen involved in any recovery plans ? #% It is a sad fact that in my own country -- and I believe in other European countries -- the threat of genital mutilation or stoning or honour murders are not a basis for granting refugee status . #% Europe is as incapable of creating jobs as the British Government is of creating jobs . #% One worrying aspect is the difficulty the Commission apparently has with the lead times for its proposals . #% I would also like to endorse what has been proposed to us by the Commission in relation to the political problem in Turkey and Cyprus , with the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey . #% It will ensure that we in Europe can give the very highest standard of jobs , training and , most importantly of all , social protection to all our citizens . #% On the particularly thorny question of reprocessing , we have high level waste that needs to be made safe much faster than is currently the case , and this processing should be continued . #% 
You can not allow what is going to happen to the Irish Box to go ahead . #% Broadly speaking I agree with the approach taken in the Commission 's communication on the future of aquaculture . #% We should put in place more resources and more finance for research and development to achieve a traceable vaccine , so we know that animals have been vaccinated . #% However , the ubiquitous Dr Rath - wherever he is , and I suspect he is in this House - has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through , making it very difficult for our services to block these e-mails . #% Far from a bargain . #% It is horrifying to think that substances such as high-grade plutonium could get into the wrong hands , like those of terrorists and criminals ; it is appalling to think of the spectre of nuclear explosive devices being available to them . #% I did not , however , support the Group line on issues such as freezing the allowances of MEPs and provision of business class travel for MEPs . #% Smoking causes 85 % of all cases of lung cancer and half of all premature deaths among life-long smokers are caused by the use of tobacco . #% Bearing in mind that 40 % of energy usage is for the purpose of warming or cooling our homes Member States should urgently introduce incentives for green energy solutions . #% It is proper that these anxieties are listened to , respected and addressed . #% The biggest difficulty with the format of the form was that it was too bureaucratic and there was no certainty or guarantee that you would get the standard of care that you required -- or even get any care -- when you were struck by an illness or a certain medical condition while you were away . #% As an admirer of the ancient civilisation of the Iraqi people , I find it hard to accept that the population has been allowed to suffer so much in the economic interests of others and been attacked both from within and without . #% I believe that policy is much better than the one of ` do n't vaccinate but rather burn ' . #% National interests are made totally subservient to what is perceived to be the EU 's overall interest . #% However , what about Euratom inspectors ? #% I was in Brussels , along with Mr Stevenson , when the negotiations took place last December . #% The effect of a food containing a substance such as sugar or salt at a low or medium level , but consumed in great quantities , is much more damaging than that of a food containing a substance at a high level but consumed only occasionally . #% We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness . #% We want closer involvement by Europol in prosecuting cyber paedophiles and better cooperation between European law enforcement agencies . #% Most of our higher quality proteins , for example Brazilian soya , are shipped vast distances from countries where the sustainability debate is now raging . #% They all accepted in the hearings that they will be responsible for themselves and their cabinets . #% Organised crime has become the main source of income and wealth for Sinn Féin / IRA . #% Mr President , I welcome the Galeote report . #% If we concentrated on hyper-cars we could have 70 % to 90 % fuel savings . #% With regard to enlargement , it is most important that the European Union and the applicant countries get down to negotiating the more difficult chapters , which to date have remained closed . #% Without their contribution to society , for which they receive no monetary remuneration , the United Kingdom would be a lesser place . #% There is a lot of ingenuity , they are perfectly wrapped , perfectly presented and perfectly labelled . #% The huge problem of confidence in our institutions has been exacerbated by the problems of the Commission in recent months . #% -- Mr President , I rarely say that it is a function of mine to defend the Commission , but Commissioners have the right to freedom of expression and , just occasionally , they may even say eminently sensible things , like President Barroso when he accepted that the Constitution is unenforceable and that we need to move on . #% Let me reiterate and emphasise that the area known as the Irish Box is a rich fishing area with a high concentration of juvenile fish and spawning grounds . #% We will be judged by our citizens on how we handle the challenge of reform . #% I have one disagreement with my colleagues Mr Andrews and Mr Gallagher about the generosity and special merits of the people of Ireland . #% It is rather disappointing that our ambitions of seven to be added last summer have been reduced to up to three at this stage . #% It is in all our interests that the objective of making Europe the world 's most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010 be achieved . #% The text as voted by Parliament runs the risk of potentially putting innocent consumers in prison , while at the same time creating loopholes for individual criminals engaged in organised and serious crime . #% However , many elements of the report which we are now considering , not through any fault of the rapporteur , are unacceptable . #% This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations . #% At the same time , it contributes to a reduction in the amount of beef produced . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Gröner for her excellent report . #% The report highlights the need for further studies on discard and its biological , marine and economic consequences . #% This point is explicitly recognized by the Committee of Inquiry . #% Mr President , I should like to ask you to inform the Commission that the Irish Ferries company is looking to fire its entire workforce and replace it with cheaper labour using the device of reflagging in Cyprus in order to avoid Irish , British and French labour law . #% Therefore , it is particularly important that the Committee on Foreign Affairs urgently draw up , as recommended , a comprehensive report on the situation in Iraq , taking into account the consequences of the war and all problems relating to the withdrawal of the illegally occupying forces , rehabilitation , reconstruction and stabilisation in that country . #% In any city in Europe you can see the amount of respiratory and allergy problems caused by pollution in our cities . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's general response and I also welcome the white paper , but I do not agree with her . #% This is of the utmost importance . #% Clearly the Commission 's detailed proposals will need to be tabled before any significant progress can be made in this matter . #% This is not only a slur against myself - and it was put to me in these offensive terms - but a slur against the work and function of the Bureau and , moreover , a slur against officials of Parliament who can not come here to answer for themselves . #% The Commission judgment was simply wrong and the Commission has yet to explain the future policy direction for the low-cost airline sector in Europe . #% There will also be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the Information Society , modern telecommunications services and Internet-related activities . #% It crosses all classes and all generations . #% I am also very concerned about monopolies and cartels in the paper industry , particularly in Ireland . #% In Montreal it was agreed that there would be two tracks in the negotiations : one for the UNFCC framework and the other for the Kyoto Protocol . #% With regard to the budget , we did not have access to the final details when this report was being drawn up . #% I have seen some progress . #% In particular I refer to the tradition in the common agricultural policy of applying premiums to male animals only . #% Funds will pay the legal bills and that is necessary . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I am sure the House would like to remember the missing UN and EU staff and all of those who are missing and suffering in Haiti at this time . #% In advance of the Commission 's report on the implementation of the original directive next June , I can report that a sensible policy of realistic derogation has already proved a success in my own country , and I hope Mrs Jackson will take note of what I am about to say . #% My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods , and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter . #% In particular , I would ask not just the Commission but the Council to be involved here and to ensure that the suppliers of education , particularly to schools , allow free access . #% Madam President , I should like to ask you to protest vehemently on behalf of all of us at the savage and brutal public execution on Tuesday of a mother of seven children by the Taliban regime in Kabul . #% I underline what Ms Jackson said to us , on the Commission 's recent communication on the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste , published in May 2003 . #% I think Mrs Banotti referred to it but as I could not hear her , because I was getting Swedish at the time , I do not really know what she said . #% I take issue with one point in the opening of the first paragraph of his report which says that there is considerable doubt about the whole question of EMU , or words to that effect . #% If we want to ensure that the regulations are there to create a level playing field within the EU , we have to see to it that our inspectors have sufficient resources to be able to meet our expectations . #% 
Of course this matter is entirely in the hands of Mr Duisenberg himself . #% I know the Irish Government is committed to that issue as a government adopting the Irish approach , but I would ask you to put that onto the agenda for the other Member States in Europe and seek to ensure progress is made on it during your six months in office . #% I believe any beneficiary of EU funding should be obliged to indicate in a prominent place such as websites , annual reports and even on headed paper the fact that they are in receipt of EU grants . #% We must all redouble our efforts so as to be sure that next year ' s World Summit is up to the challenge of ensuring that development takes place in a sustained manner and also in a matter which protects existing communities . #% Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , I should like to begin by congratulating the Prime Minister and his colleagues on a successful presidency . #% However , it is important to note that there has been a reduction in the number of pelagic vessels permitted from 22 to 15 . #% If the British nuclear industry is such a model profession , why do BNFL not agree to allow the European Commission independently to evaluate its operations and the powers which derive under the EURATOM Treaty ? #% Madam President , I want to draw to your attention and that of the House the fact that Jimmy Goldsmith 's Referendum Party in Britain has provided # 150 , 000 to the Ulster Unionist Party . #% To that extent there are some very welcome initiatives coming from the Andersson report and from the Commission 's Green Paper . #% The ELDR believes that we need to focus more urgent attention on asylum and immigration . #% The collapse of the market and the collapse of consumer confidence due to BSE has caused a huge income drop for farmers . #% There is something surrealistic - and in fact disgusting - about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war . #% Of particular interest are the extension of Community competence in areas of security and safety , and the impact on the sector of Community initiatives such as the Single European Sky and the Air Traffic Management System . #% While I agree - and no one disagrees in this House - that we must foster a culture of voluntary donations as the norm , as the ethos , in all our Member States , I plead with this House not to specifically exclude paid donations . #% We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable . #% Taoiseach , I want to congratulate you on being able to bring forward a nominee for President of the Commission in Prime Minister Barroso . #% I am pleased that Mrs Gradin said that the Commission would deal speedily with this , but I am dismayed that the Council says that it has no timetable in its agenda . #% We must get rid of these excessively long journeys , particularly where animals are being transported to places as far away as the Middle East . #% We have no redress ... #% It is to them , not to the institutions of Europe , that I owe my allegiance . #% However , no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum . #% At a time when one would expect a scaling-down of nuclear enterprises in Britain , the British government has announced that the MOX nuclear facility can go ahead at Sellafield . #% Irrespective of harmonisation , this idea of mutual respect , trust and understanding between the judicial authorities is the first step towards creating a wider and more inclusive area of judicial operation . #% Small local cottage industries have great scope for boosting local economies . #% It is great that the public will actually have access to this information because lame excuses were used in the past for refusing it . #% We in the EU put a lot on the table in the interests of developing countries in the area of agriculture , market access and so on . #% If we could agree on those two questions , we would have an amicable solution to all the other questions that arise . #% Indeed , many references to Ireland in the report are out of date . #% I suppose the fact that the opinions of these committees are sought is some consolation , but in a general way this decision needs some sort of explanation . #% Those views were reinforced by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy last week : we are in favour of the development of therapies for dreadful diseases by the use of embryonic stem cells under very strict conditions , with no creation of embryos for research , with the use of supernumerary embryos , with the consent of parents and without payment . #% Politically , however , I regret the failure of the Vienna Council to adopt specific decisions of substance . #% These are demands that can not be met if we want to maintain a viable , sustainable agricultural sector within the European Union for the future . #% I say to colleagues and especially to you , Commissioner , that this has to stop . #% This report has come forward now that we are on the threshold of achieving our objective and it is entirely timely to ask what should be the external purpose of and role of the euro . #% It is disrespectful of the rights of the citizens of Europe and for the dignity of the people of Europe . #% Any compromise proposals drawn up by the Irish presidency do not set a target date for the Gas Directive to come into effect nor does it give any indication of whether there would be follow-up measures . #% These mountains of ageing refrigerators , and in warmer climates air conditioners , are rusting in every population centre in the EU . #% The Commission 's first triennial report on cohesion policies and their impact has been an essential part of the evaluation reflection on future priorities for cohesion policies . #% Something more profound is needed than relabelling old wine in new bottles . #% This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production . #% Something needs to be done or we will have no clothing , footwear and such labour-intensive industries . #% An increasing amount of concern is being expressed in all the Member States about the increase in the incidence of child abduction . #% In June 1995 the Council of Ministers adopted wide-ranging rules on the transport of animals . #% Nonetheless , there is much to be recommended in the Commission 's proposals and there is a clear way forward for harmonising criminal sanctions by means of a third-pillar instrument . #% As well as that we have two major problems with the Commission 's proposal . #% We have to act , as the interior ministers did last week , when they suggested that long-term admission of Kosovars to countries outside the region would consolidate their displacement from their homes . #% We need an initiative to enhance our credibility and to prove that Europe is capable of responding to economic and social crisis . #% . I abstained in the vote on the proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport because of the lack of integrity in the overall report . #% I am particularly pleased that Parliament 's resolution recognises and appreciates the quiet and effective ways in which Archbishop Courtney had been helping the peace process and alleviating the suffering of the people of Burundi . #% I also welcome the proposed improvement and accessibility of signs aboard ship and the provision of alarm systems which are not only accessible to all passengers but which can be seen and heard by all passengers . #% Rural society has been on a downward spiral for many years , and you do not need me to rehearse the problems again . #% I see no reason why European Union Member States can not work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible . #% I will attend to it this week . #% We will judge our final vote in the light of which amendments carry . #% In building close relations between the Union and Iran -- which has a population of over 70 million people -- it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption , political prejudice and political coercion . #% My next point touches upon the European institute for technology , research and development and what is required for that . #% So there was much delay there but we did eventually receive that opinion from the Commission , in February of this year , at the stage when the negotiations were well under way with the first wave countries . #% I am pleased that the Commission has been most cooperative with the temporary committee throughout the period of its work . #% Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate . #% Thankfully , it would now seem that we are learning our lessons . #% I welcome the Ombudsman 's initiative in that regard and I look forward to debating it in Parliament in the near future . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tangible expression of solidarity with workers who have lost their jobs due to major structural changes in world trade patterns . #% We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO . #% Such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable . #% I am not aware that there is any existing difficulty . #% This would be a gross injustice and deception of organic farmers , sellers and consumers . #% 
I join my fellow parliamentarians here collectively in sending our condolences to the friends and families of the victims of that crash . #% Do you take into account farmers on the periphery of Europe - Ireland , Greece , Spain or wherever - who can not get here ? #% My duty as a MEP , is to stress the necessity of climate change protection to : the people we represent , our EU counterparts and our international partners . #% I recall Commissioner Bjerregaard saying at the press conference at the end that we would have wanted to achieve more , that we always do , but that this was as much as we could persuade the other parties to the conference to agree to . #% One of the extraordinary aspects of this issue is the fact that those outside the UK who purchased policies from Equitable Life did so believing that they had European Union protection and that the regulators in their own country would protect them . #% The idea of setting up a case book and collecting evidence is an excellent idea . #% But this is a sterile debate and I do not propose to get into it . #% I consider these comments from the chairman of the Convention unacceptable and inappropriate . #% Hopefully , the EU will get the nerve to say to China , ` we love you , we will trade with you , but we will not cooperate with you or say you are right when you are wrong ' . #% There should be more consultation when administrative changes of this kind are made . #% Today 's comedy of errors and misjudgments would be gravely compounded if the error of naming Mr Giansily for expulsion was on some technicality to be followed through . #% In Ireland we consider VRT to be a national tax and we consider the mix of taxation , the rate of taxation , to be a matter falling within national competence . #% While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round , the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement . #% It must be one of the priorities of the European Union to tackle drugs . #% What are we to make of the fact that this investigation by the UK Nuclear Inspectorate resulted from a press report in the UK Independent , following which the UK Government sent in a posse , as it were - the Nuclear Inspectorate . #% If Europe is to protect the future diversity of crops , it must ensure that farmers are guaranteed such free access and use . #% From the example of last weekend , it is clear that the over-centralised EU is presently not working . #% It is unacceptable politically and economically that some Member States should seek to revert to protectionist policies . #% Mr President , as we have already heard , there are many actors involved in what we have to do in order to meet our responsibilities . #% I appeal to the Commission and to the Council to insist that the Irish Government reverse its decision to abandon the carbon tax . #% I myself know what it is like to have a healthy child become disabled . #% For my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions . #% The one thing we can say for certain is that the present common fisheries policy is not one of the best-loved policies of the Union , and there is certainly no guarantee that future changes will endear any future policy to the industry , especially given the pressure on fish stocks and the differing views of scientists and fishermen . #% Racism is a crime - a crime that is not pursued in the Union , an offence against a law that is not enforced in the Union . #% Indeed , in her reply , she referred to the action plan , the climate strategy and the Sixth Framework Programme . #% The good news is that Morocco has recently become the first Islamic country to sign this particular piece of international legislation , for which I would like to congratulate that country . #% I thank the Commission and the authorities concerned for including for the first time a protocol in an FMD contingency plan for a non-susceptible species . #% This recast was born because the original directive was being poorly implemented . #% I think there has been a will on the part of Ministers and , more than that , a will on the part of the Heads of State and Government to make real progress . #% It is a fundamental right for people to be able to protest throughout the European Union . #% When environmental damage occurs , the first question always is : who is going to pay ? #% It is clear that the proximity of residential areas to landfill sites poses a huge risk . #% Mr President , I agree with and support most of what has been said , but I wish to raise two points . #% I feel it necessary to say this at this time because there are many calls for the return of the death penalty for certain crimes , and I am very glad indeed that the resolution includes a proscription on that . #% We should export on the hook and not the hoof . #% The Irish Government is presently putting together a national development plan outlining our economic and social investment priorities for the seven-year period post-1999 . #% deputising for the author . - Given the fact that we live in an increasingly digital world , as you have acknowledged , where so much of our daily business is carried out online , one group that , in my view , has been left behind are older citizens , who have limited or no access to the Internet . #% The key we believe is sharing best practice . #% The opium trade is now said to provide work for 7 % of the Afghan population . #% I welcome the enactment of new codes of judicial procedure and criminal procedure and the establishment of a standing committee to investigate complaints of torture and a national programme to eliminate poverty . #% We must not give any succour to the forces in US politics who show a tendency towards isolationism , many of whose voices are now raised in the current US Presidential election . #% He will have the support of many people in this Chamber . #% It is important that the European Parliament has the necessary budget to properly fulfil the mandate which has been given to it from the European people . #% Motor insurance is a multi-billion euro business and further competition must be encouraged so that consumers can reap the benefits . #% I hope that this great wrong which has been done to Northern Ireland will be put right . #% Commissioner , I say this regardless of precedent or quoting interinstitutional agreements , because I would like to say yet again on the record that , just a few weeks after you were appointed , Commissioner , at the conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires in relation to climate change , COP 10 , you made great strides in including the Members of the European Parliament , both before and after various meetings , in terms of full briefings . #% I was particularly moved by what Commissioner Piebalgs said in his opening statement about the people who went in immediately after the accident to do the clean-up work , to try to put concrete into the sarcophagus , and to try to protect the rest of the population . #% Our task is not made any easier because we are asking the electorate to overturn a decision it has already made . #% It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva ; otherwise , no one will take us seriously . #% Currently both consumers and retailers have to contend with the fact that goods can be physically moved across the EU in one or two days , yet the payment in relation to these goods can take between three and five days to clear . #% Borders are being shut down , sometimes arbitrarily , and sometimes following a terrorist attack . #% I accept that there are regions within Objective I regions and sub-regions within those regions that have not done as well as others . #% Yet , as Mr Tindemans says , the Amsterdam Treaty makes a common defence policy a more credible prospect given that it strengthens the organic bond between the European Union and the Western European Union , created by Maastricht . #% It could well be that this directive is insufficiently ambitious and that it should also apply to much smaller surface areas . #% The work undertaken by the Irish presidency has already established many of the yardsticks we need to follow . #% Ever since the European Convention was set up , however , extensive negotiations and discussions have taken place across all elements of European Union society . #% This fund can provide for those who have lost their jobs to retrain and acquire qualifications to get back into the workforce . #% Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to wish the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Spring , every success in the course of the Irish presidency agus go n'eirí an bóthar leat sa post atá romhat amach anseo . #% First and foremost it must restate the commitments to establish a single currency in 1999 and the advantages which this currency will bring to most of Europe 's citizens . #% It is also correct in asserting that the issue of the budget threshold is a delicate one , and must take into account global costs . #% I am most concerned about the issue of sanctions ; it is regrettable that they are not included . #% The debacle over nitrates does little to endear the Commission to EU citizens . #% Mr President , approximately 58 000 people die each year in the European Union as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury . #% Those who would have us believe that in Northern Ireland we have the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other , do not accurately describe the situation . #% As you know , this commission also deals with the question of reparations in the aftermath of the Gulf War . #% China is a gigantic sweatshop of exploitation of workers . #% 
I do not think that is acceptable . #% Setting up a system that allows for safety and civil aviation authorities to share information available from the different reporting schemes will enable all parties involved learn from their mistakes thereby producing a safer system for all air users in future . #% The minister representing the United Kingdom presidency , John Battle , is one of the enthusiasts for renewable energy and he has personally reassured me that he will not allow ALTENER II to slip away until it is too late to implement . #% I would like to see a uniform inspection regime throughout the Community and the harmonisation of penalties for infringements . #% Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur . #% The Péry report on the crisis in the fisheries sector quite correctly points out that there are several problems that affect the industry , but surely the most important is the fact that there are too many boats chasing too few fish . #% If carbon dioxide is not reduced , the Arctic ice cover will disappear . #% I welcome the new Commission 's commitment to continuing this fund which provides people with a ` hand up ' as opposed to a ` hand out ' following redundancy . #% However , they are worth repeating . #% We are back on a typical Green agenda , Mr President , the same old story : no matter what you give them they want more and more . #% Without being complacent , we have established some protection for EU citizens . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner , and the rapporteur for his report . #% Some EU-based multinationals previously wreaked havoc in countries such as Bolivia with water privatisation and their baleful influence is already being felt in Canada . #% Look at the century we have just left . #% The report has not dealt with serious concerns such as ethics in biotechnology , public health , consumers ' concerns regarding food , and indeed the effects on the environment . #% Let me say that we wish you a Happy Christmas , but also a very prosperous and politically active New Year . #% In this regard , we deplore the continued failure of the Council to deliver the financial protocol for Turkey , and ask today how the presidency proposes to unblock this unhappy situation . #% Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform . #% Mr President , in making our decisions on the aviation industry in Europe we have to take account of the interconnectedness of our economies and politics in Europe and globally as well . #% Mr President , this debate would be amusing if it were not so serious . #% That serves only to increase the number of poultry reared in appalling conditions . #% Obviously the whole area of new technologies is one that has presented us with many problems as well as boundless opportunities . #% I would like to acknowledge the historic period of enlargement which will happen under your watch and welcome into the Community our ten new Member States with their considerable scientific enterprise and research skills , which must be harnessed and developed to full capacity . #% My apologies for the inability of the shadow rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , to be with us this evening . #% We need a positive operational environment for SMEs . #% We would also like to see States create a stronger possible verification regime in order to curb the hostile misuse of biological technologies . #% Many Member States welcomed refugees from Chile . #% The question of whether participation in the emissions trading scheme provided for under this directive should be mandatory in the pilot phase has been the subject of much debate in Member States , including Ireland . #% I was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Group 's objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues ; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say . #% Now the whole world - not simply America - is paying the price of these errors of judgement . #% The President of this Parliament , Mr Cox , actually attended one of these meetings in Sweden a couple of years ago . #% Multiannual plans are vital to allow the sector to plan forward . #% I strongly believe that Parliament should endorse the opinion of the report before it . #% The European PVC industry has signed a voluntary commitment concerning the sustainable development of PVC and this programme is to be implemented this year . #% This Parliament can not afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions , be it Parliament or the Commission or , indeed the Council , being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time . #% Tax incentives must be used to encourage the early introduction of vehicles containing advanced anti-pollution equipment . #% We all know that the beef sector has come through a very difficult period , but many serious problems remain for farmers . #% On the question of principle , no Member of this House surely has so little respect for him or herself that they feel they should not be paid a proper salary at a level common to each and every one of us . #% European funding alone can not achieve this for them . #% We based our decision on political ideology rather than scientific investigation . #% I am more than a little disappointed with the answer from the President-in-Office , but it may well be outside the competence of the EU as he has said . #% These require a full and proper debate in Parliament . #% It is clearly necessary that the use of mercury is properly controlled and we have made substantial progress in recent years on related matters such as storage and export . #% It does not address the question of how the current situation in Iraq evolved over the last two years and therefore fails to criticise the Bush Administration 's defiance of the UN in its rush to invade Iraq . #% Parliament will support the Commission and make sure it is not sidelined by one or two of the larger Member States wishing to do so for any particular reason . #% Anybody who examines closely trends in public spending will find that , and the fact that this has not been identified by either the Commission or the Court of Auditors means that there is some weakness in our system of evaluation . #% We now have the ludicrous situation of the nuclear industry shopping dangerous radioactive material around the planet . #% I would ask with respect that the Commissioner , in the interests of probity , satisfy herself fully as to the genesis of this regulation in question to ensure the impact of its roll-out on the aviation industry world-wide . #% In Europe we went on to bring in the euro and concentrate on enlargement . #% However , I can speak on behalf of the people in my constituency in the south-west of Ireland , whom I met last weekend . #% But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude . #% We particularly welcome the Council 's invitation to the Commission to make proposals as to how new and creative ways can be found to support the fresh opportunities which the peace agreement will bring . #% It was a historic occasion . #% The Presidency should also have been aware of the public attacks on the EOM by several government ministers , using such inflammatory language as ` these Western whites have no interest in peace in Pakistan ; these people come from unfriendly nations and have hostile objectives ; this Mission is interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan ' . #% My own Member State , Ireland , was known as the island of saints and scholars , with a great tradition for producing literature ; and the encouragement and promotion of reading and literature is always welcome . #% The United States Government has more than doubled the level of subsidies per farmer . #% I was very much against it . #% What was everybody 's business was nobody 's business . #% I concur with the people of Ireland . #% Firstly , let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East . #% Anti-pollution devices must remain effective for at least 80 000 km or five years from the year 2000 onwards , and for at least 100 000 km from 2005 . #% What does it really mean ? #% On that basis , I support a medical and scientific evaluation of the impact of such a law two years after this legislation comes into force . #% I am prepared , as rapporteur , to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary . #% I plead with colleagues , whatever your views are on the important topics in that report , do not let what we do in this Parliament be misused and abused by those people . #% Mr President , I am very alarmed that no real effort has been made to act on the experiences that the UK had during the devastating outbreak of foot and mouth . #% 
Furthermore , how can Yasser Arafat exert any authority when he is humiliated in this way by Ariel Sharon ? #% Other points can certainly -- and probably will -- be made in political dialogue . #% Quite frankly , I do not think it is a particularly just system because some of the hardest criminals are being released . #% There is no other way in which we can achieve that cooperation in the longer term . #% Perhaps if she concentrated more on the documents , rather than speaking in a language that no one cares to understand , she might not have made such a fundamental mistake . #% We are aware that the Germans and the Japanese are sending their nuclear waste for processing to Sellafield because it is politically too uncomfortable for them to do it in their own countries because of concerns about this . #% Between 15 January and 25 January last , over 45 people were injured from bomb attacks alone , while ten people were killed during the same period . #% Indeed , we could even call it fraudulent accounting practice . #% EU leaders are now meeting next week , on 12 December 2003 , to see whether they can hammer out the final agreement which will govern the future of the European Union . #% For the first time in the history of this particular Parliament an alternative resolution to the Swiebel report on fundamental rights is being proposed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro . #% With regard to rural tourism , there is a need to link projects together for the purposes of marketing and promotion in order to create a critical mass , and it is essential to decentralise tourism functions to the regions . #% The other point is the question of the just return . #% These proposals are flawed and will not achieve the aim of sustainable development . #% As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive , we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services . #% The areas of concern I have about the amendments and some of the proposals put forward relate firstly to tax harmonisation , which I oppose totally , and secondly to increased regulatory supervision over the operation of these funds , because we already have a raft of legislation governing investment vehicles and investment instruments . #% The most effective way to achieve European goals in relation to sustainable development and environmental policies is through full cooperation across all Member States . #% This report emphasizes the importance of space , the need for support from public funds - commercial interests will be totally inadequate - and the real added value that comes from European Union work . #% Commissioner , you mentioned the Hague Convention of 1996 which , thankfully , was recognised last November . #% We failed to protect them . #% The first concerns the very important amendment tabled by my colleague Mr Piétrasanta in committee . #% We do not want to see further disintegration . #% The next logical step , also in harmony with the Charter of Fundamental Rights , is the accession of the EU institutions to the European Social Charter . #% Commissioner , could you just clarify for me , in your comments regarding the Vaxholm case , that you are not in a position to comment ? #% It was not the common fisheries policy in itself that destroyed the stocks , it was the lack of the necessary supervision . #% I would like to thank the Members , and especially my own colleagues , for their support for the Dell application and ask as well that they will support further applications in similar circumstances coming down the road from Waterford Crystal and SR Technics . #% I have been assured by Commission officials that negotiations for third country fisheries agreements are based on information provided by this committee . #% I strongly endorse the priority which the presidency proposes to give to the objective of showing the peoples of Europe that the European Union is working for them in practical ways . #% It is one thing to be in a job and have this condition , but if you have the condition it is virtually impossible to access a job subsequently . #% Having visited Kashmir and seen some of the devastating effects of the past violence but also having seen a people ready for peace , I support this report based on the importance it has for the way the European Union seeks , by offering best practice measures and experience , to show other countries how an economic zone can develop peace and prosperity in regions that have a history of war . #% The ultimate crime is to do nothing , to neglect our duty to protect children everywhere including those who are forced into child prostitution . #% I would say to my colleagues from the Black Sea region : learn from the mistakes of the CFP , examine the consequences the present regime has had on the small-scale fisheries of the north-east Atlantic and ask is this what we want for the Black Sea ? #% We will be able to get on with our business , as so overwhelmingly decided by the electorate , and he can get on with his . #% It seems to me that a number of the forestry schemes that operate in Ireland most of the benefits go to speculators , particularly from outside the country . #% One of the tragedies of our planet is the waste of human intelligence and creativity in countries which have been politically discriminatory or else riven by poverty . #% We should not seek to reopen the debate as to the merits or demerits of what happened in Iraq earlier this year . #% It could also play a number of additional roles in EU waters , such as providing an adequate emergency response mechanism should an environmental disaster , such as the , occur again . #% There is no doubt of the need to diversify , but there are not many new ideas out there . #% This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning and is committed to a universal ban on human cloning . #% There is just a note of caution I wish to give my colleagues in Parliament . #% I would be grateful if colleagues whose assistants are experiencing difficulties in their travel arrangements and , indeed , colleagues in the same predicament , could contact my office as soon as possible . #% While not wishing to dispute assurances given by researchers that the breakthrough is not aimed at creating a human being , the reality is that such a fundamental issue can not now be entrusted to individuals who are free to operate outside existing legislation . #% We can fully support the vast majority of this report and we welcome many of its recommendations . #% We have had much talk but we have had no great success to date . #% Operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in , and out-of-date equipment . #% The Commission must also demonstrate to us that cooperation between service providers and copyright holders will not impinge on citizens ' fundamental rights , especially the right to privacy , the right to freedom of expression and the right to due process . #% I do not agree with the views of my colleague , Mr de Roo , in the specific amendments he has introduced on noise at airports and in the environs of airports in this piece of legislation . #% The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate . #% Can he confirm to the House that this is no longer on the table ? #% There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research . #% access to religious institutions #% Also , the added value will come from the fact that the EGF will not replace actions that are the responsibility of companies , but are a valuable addition to measures taken at national level . #% So far I can not see how training compensation is going to deliver that . #% They have sent a signal to Berlin that these areas and communities are not a political priority for them . #% There are several aspects of concern for Chile 's coastal communities : unfair competition with the local artisanal sector and the unknown impact on marine resources , for example . #% If we are to provide these medicines to those who need them , we have to override the intellectual property rights of companies who have patented the technology to combat these diseases . #% Medicated feed must not be used to support or underpin poor farm management or weak animal health and welfare standards . #% I would like to say to Mr Prodi that we , in our group , believe that as part of his European vocation for a new millennium and for the new enlarged Europe - he should perhaps reflect on the desirability of introducing into the debate the concept of a constitution for Europe . #% The European Union must be equally professional and use all its combined forces to tackle these crime barons throughout the European Union . #% We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out , and then Aer Lingus , which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland . #% After immigrants , we take on the gypsies , then citizens we do not like the look of . #% There is no legal certainty in the area of risk assessment for exposure to solar radiation in the workplace , and it is a legal certainty that in a litigious age it will end up as a lawyers ' charter , and nothing else . #% The principal purpose of the Shelter Improvement Plan must be to close and decommission the plant completely , as quickly as possible . #% Sadly , this agreement can not be straightforward . #% in writing . - I support this report which seeks , in light of the EU 's commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and halve extreme poverty by 2015 , to address the most pressing health problems in sub-Saharan Africa and the question of what systems can be put in place to do so . #% In this regard , I have two main criticisms to make of Ecofin and European Council work so far - and I mean this in a very constructive way . #% The fact that we only have 14 amendments to the report tomorrow is a reflection on the work he has done . #% 
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , can I also express my appreciation to the rapporteur for a very good report . #% I shall confine my remarks to the Maaten report . #% It is easier for us in the institutions to advocate these things ; we are expected to do so . #% Commercial services are one thing , but core public services , like social housing and welfare provision , are something quite different and should not be the plaything of profit-driven providers . #% This will be expensive , but it is well worth paying that price . #% It shows that the Union is currently working with other international organisations to deal with the discard problem . #% The Member States must ensure the budgetary flexibility required in no way endangers continued full funding of PEACE 11 , as envisaged last year when funding for that programme was guaranteed into 2006 . #% It updates Directive 90/426/EEC on the import of equidae and Directive 92/65/EEC on animal health requirements governing trade in imports into the Community of animals , semen , ova and embryos . #% For Europe , in good faith and in good conscience , the ELDR Group believes this Commission should go . #% So that is terribly important . #% It is incumbent on us , because of the institution that we are part of , because of the moral authority which we have in this Parliament as the democratically -- elected voice of the people , we should stand up and resist all violence against people . #% We look , too , at the great tenacity you have displayed in the past 30 years in trying to find peace . #% As you can see , even in the electoral process in Member States positive discrimination is the only way to get women elected to national parliaments and to the European Parliament . #% I would appeal to the Irish presidency to put this matter on the agenda of the EU-US summit in June this year . #% This is a high-profile case in Ireland at the moment , but there have been a number of cases in recent times where workers ' rights , particularly immigrant workers ' rights , have been trampled on . #% Wherever the last speaker conjured up his figures , he certainly did not conjure them up from the published Commission figures . #% Never again will the future of Europe be decided behind closed doors , provided we do our work constructively in the Convention . #% My group will be supporting the report as it stands in its entirety and will not be expecting or requesting any deletions of parts of paragraphs or phrases . #% This agency must be equipped with the resources to undertake this task . #% I firmly believe that the benefits of the information society must be spread to both urban and rural areas and to all regions within the Union . #% With the creation of the single market it is now basically up to Brussels to control everything : indirect taxation , national budgets , interest rates and corporate tax . #% I share the view of other colleagues that it is unfortunate to describe the role that this House can play as one merely of observer . #% I agree with Mrs Pery when she says fishing communities throughout Europe have little confidence in present policy . #% I have a very simple question for the Commission and I should like to have a reply tonight . #% These issues can not be addressed in a piecemeal manner . #% We need to have a concrete example of your commitment . #% Mr President , the Commission has claimed that it is entering a new phase with respect to fisheries agreements and that from now on they are to be called ` partnership agreements ' . #% Mr President , I appreciate and thank you for your kind words . #% Finally , to come back again to the point of Morocco ' s right to make its own decisions . #% We all know what the answer to that is , so the Syrian troops must be swiftly withdrawn . #% The impact of domestic and physical and/or sexual violence should not be underestimated , as it results in severe damage to individuals ' physical and mental health giving rise to severe depression and even suicide . #% Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union . #% The only question I have about the Giansily report is paragraph 5 , which talks about importing products without any cost to the European budget or disruption to European markets . #% I supported Amendment 170 in order to put down a marker that there is a need to control the issue of marketing of unhealthy foodstuffs to children . #% With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro , our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border transactions remains fragmented , resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions . #% Its operation will clearly be fragmented and distorted if national governments within the EU have to contribute 25 % of all CAP payments to their respective farmers . #% Mr President , I support the action plan of the European Commission , which seeks to promote the greater use of alternative fuels in Europe between now and 2010 . #% I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria . #% -- Madam President , this plan proposes to implement actions through existing initiatives and programmes to which resources have already been allocated under the operational budgets of the services concerned , in particular the Public Health Programme and the Sixth Framework Programme for Research . #% This report suggests that the abolition of VRT will be good for the Irish consumer . #% Today I voted in favour of the package of amendments designed to ensure the inclusion of key ethical safeguards in the legislation on advanced therapy medicinal products . #% This provision - Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty - is clearly a recognition that the European Union must introduce confidence-building measures in the field of public and human health , in the light of difficulties which arose as a result of the problems relating to BSE and blood-contaminated products in many European states in recent years . #% Would this damage European Union science and , most importantly of all , would it damage the prospects of helping people who are suffering from terrible diseases ? #% I am however concerned that the Commission might be repeating the mistakes already clearly identified in the BSE report . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report . #% I have to say I am angry at how some of our citizens treat these strangers . #% If one fish is found dead in a stream , lake or inland waterway anywhere in the European Union , there is war ; someone is taken to court , and people are brought to justice . #% The final issue on which the debate rested was whether a doctor would be responsible for the assessment of the eligibility of donors , whereas the Council wanted a health professional and deemed that to be sufficient . #% The Prestige disaster highlighted the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation and the lack of a sufficient EU response mechanism , which aggravated the environmental impact . #% America Online , for example , runs its own merchant business programme where it guarantees to support the consumer in getting legal redress from any of the businesses that use them as a provider . #% The report states that the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects provides a good basis for greater protection of the environment , especially by promoting energy efficiency , but the wording is meaningless . #% What I am asking you today , Mr President and Members , is that we have a rotation process in those offices so that every four years there is a rotation of the A grades in those offices so that they become familiar with one another , with the workings of this Parliament and with the work of its Members . #% When there is a demand for live animals , we have to meet this demand within the strict rules and regulations outlined of course . #% I appreciate the enormous difficulties . #% The problem is set to get worse , as waste quantities will increase significantly over the next decades . #% I do not believe that our current difficulties over our divided response to the Iraq crisis should give rise to pessimism and paralysis . #% Would it be in violation of our obligations under GATT ? #% I do have a reservation about paragraph 4 because the main terrorism , in fact , has come from the Rajapaksa Government against the people . #% I thought the Council was going to say again that this is not its responsibility . #% On 28 August last , you requested the assistance of the Spanish authorities on the issue of the competent authority to transmit this document . #% We need to get a grip on proliferation , and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal . #% I would hope that , after this debate , the House will give it its full support . #% But then that is not an immediate priority under the plan . #% I would like to ask Mr Juncker in the remaining days of his presidency , Mr Borrell and Mr Barroso , to support that initiative and demonstrate to the people of Europe that we have a future together . #% It is extraordinary that while we know that 20 % of the weapons that the United States sells fall into the wrong hands , we have no statistics whatsoever on the quantity of arms exports from the European Union that fall into the wrong hands . #% Firstly , we must of course - and I think all Members in this Parliament agree - have the best possible environment for each of our citizens to allow them to have full freedom of health and safety . #% 
We need in the global context to insist on appropriate regulation , but to try to discover as parliamentarians what it is . #% On my own behalf and that of the ALDE Group , I warmly welcome the sisters and partner of Mr McCartney to the European Parliament in Strasbourg today . #% Trying to find agreement and , if necessary , compromise on all of those considerations was never going to be easy . #% The value of domestic work is not included in our GDP calculations and , for that reason among others , domestic work is very often invisible and is certainly undervalued . #% Poverty inevitably outweighs concerns about conservation and makes enforcement measures seem unjustified and hard to implement where people depend on bushmeat to survive . #% So now that we have gained some experience of drafting regulations , I think we have learned a bit about how to go about it . #% The adoption , ratification and implementation of the ILO convention can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor and improve the position of the large number of women on the labour market . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office what stage has been reached in meeting the Lisbon commitments . #% That can help to eliminate or to reduce our dependence on oil , it can also contribute towards a cleaner environment and , most importantly of all , it can offer many farmers around the European Union a valuable crop to grow , which would guarantee them economic security for the future . #% IRA Army Council member ` Slab ' Murphy is a leading crime boss in Ireland presiding over a border empire built on fuel smuggling . #% The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe . #% And on behalf of my group I must say we were very disappointed to have to take that negative position because we have supported many of the positive aspects of the report . #% I will vote against to ensure that in the longer term the Northern Ireland agriculture industry is not destroyed in the name of efficiency . #% But it is clear that in some European countries horses are produced for human consumption - in the Benelux countries , France and Italy , there is quite a large consumption of horsemeat - and we have to take this into account . #% By the Commission 's own admission a new protocol was not negotiated because a scientific survey had not been conducted . #% This is all about ensuring that women have the freedom to choose . #% We know what our collective challenges are in this regard , so let us go and meet them . #% One might consider that a minor matter over which we should not get so upset . #% I would ask those in this House who are supporting Mr Berlusconi in opposing the European arrest warrant to ask themselves why are they supporting a situation where the criminals who put these people into this container will escape the justice which needs to be meted out to them ? #% The Minister intends to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases : if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years or if the quota owner has a leasing arrangement which expires in March one year and he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year . #% I am intrigued by your answer in pretending that the British Government stands in favour of more transparency . #% I am happy to see that in the caring provisions men are increasingly becoming , for example , state-registered nurses , giving wonderful care and cheering up the old ladies . #% However , the prime responsibility rests with the Irish Government . #% One of the most interesting is the simple idea of a national holiday on Europe Day . #% At the very least , all full-time mothers ' work must be credited for contributory pension purposes . #% If this House does not give assent to the general regulation , there can be no agreement for the regulations that follow on from it . #% The issue of who is going to regulate any new liberalized gas network in each Member State of the EU appears to remain unresolved . #% Cost-cutting and cutting corners caused the biggest environmental disaster in history . #% If actions like this continue , either on the part of an individual Member State or a group of them , the EU 's common foreign and security policy will be in tatters , despite the best efforts of Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana . #% 873 000 people commit suicide , and that is probably underestimated . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I hope this debate and resolution will add , in some small way , to the international pressure to successfully achieve the release of Alan Johnston following his abduction two weeks ago . #% I am also somewhat surprised that the last speaker seems ignorant of the fact that there are different provisions in the Republic of Ireland and that it has been granted an extension and deferment until the end of 2011 . #% This point should not be forgotten , especially if Milosevic fails to honour the US-brokered agreement and comply with UN security resolutions in letter and in spirit . #% We abolish national embassies . #% The signing of the ratification protocol for Kyoto by some of the major players has been a much-welcomed event . #% I certainly agree . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Andersson on his report despite the misgiving that I have with regard to some parts of it . #% Discussions were based on the debate about what happened in the North Sea . #% It is revolting to see right-wing politicians scapegoating gay people in Lithuania . #% When the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified by all the Member States and comes into being , how do you view the unanimity clause as regards the non-discrimination and social exclusion provisions . #% He has done a splendid job and it has rightly been recognised by Parliament . #% ` As you are aware , the Regulation is an important step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the European Climate Change Action Programme . #% The European Parliament is also concerned about reports of serious overcrowding and poor conditions in the refugee camps established by the Sri Lankan Government . #% The continent of Europe is not our fatherland and never can be . #% Our problems with the resolution are not just on this point - although it is a very serious issue . #% We have to ask why they do it , and whether they are doing it to make a lot of extra money , as Mr Häusling says . #% Rather than criticising or pointing the finger and saying that this tragedy was more dramatic , more damaging or more influential in European politics than others , let us agree that it happened and use it as an example . #% Now is the time to chart the new way forward and to dust down the roadmap , invigorate it and make it new for the 21st century . #% We do not want to jeopardise what has been a successful job creation mechanism by sending out strong signals to investors that we do not want to remain at the heart of the European Union and at the heart of the internal market . #% The implementation of those lines has been heavily criticised in the past . #% Four times more women than men across Europe work part-time . #% Mr President , the job Parliament has here today is quite simple : to adopt or reject the compromise achieved in conciliation . #% At a national level , legislatures need to come down hard on those convicted , and resources must be given to police forces so that it is not for lack of finance or manpower that trafficking is allowed to continue . #% The promotion of liberalisation and mobility must not be achieved at the expense of public health and consumer protection . #% Only 700 000 of the 6 million who needed antiretrovirals could access that treatment . #% Commercial banks multiply the money supply issued by at least 10 to 15 times , and this is the reason that states get into debt , i.e. so that banks can make these huge profits . #% Madam President , I voted against this resolution . #% On the issue of radioactive substances , during the debate in the committee the Commission representative said that it was `` implicit '' but we want it to be explicit . #% Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion . #% Over 70 000 Sri Lankans have died in this conflict since 1973 and any initiative to prevent further loss of life would be very worthwhile . #% There will be access to a frontier-free trading bloc encompassing over 20 European countries , assuming that the accession negotiations with the countries of Eastern and Central Europe prove successful . #% The agreement needs to be limited in duration and liable for immediate termination should any obligation not be met . #% We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort . #% I also congratulate Ambassador Anderson and the Irish civil service . #% Firstly , legislation is what works . #% I am very pleased to concur with the suggestion put forward by the honourable Member . #% 
The Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme known as EMAS afforded an opportunity to EU companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations . #% author . - Like myself , the Commissioner is totally au fait with the Irish situation , where 18 000 workers cross the border every day from one jurisdiction to another and where 5 200 students and 1.7 million people either take holidays or go shopping from one side of the border to the other . #% This is about choice . #% It is a complex and very un-user-friendly piece of legislation regulation at the moment . #% I support a strong political dimension to the new cooperation agreements with ACP countries , especially in the areas of human rights , good governance and the rule of law . #% That Committee must also be mandated to investigate the whole issue of protection of human rights and democratic transparency in the context of the fight against terrorism . #% Member States should finance measures , including observer programmes , to monitor their responsibilities . #% I feel slightly uncomfortable , given that Ireland is the home of the Dublin Convention and has only very recently begun to receive an appreciable number of refugees and asylum seekers , that unfortunately , the Dublin Convention is not working terribly well . #% Increased profit and market control by multinationals has been at the expense of small family farms . #% We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy . #% The truth is that this disease can strike anywhere and at any time . #% The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform . #% We held out the hope and the desire and the wish that those countries could become part of the European Union . #% Perhaps you can not prevent what has happened , but you can ensure that it does not happen again and that this will not be a signal to other Member States to follow suit , because freedom of the press is an extremely important aspect of democracy . #% I attempted to delete paragraph 125 , but was unsuccessful in doing so ( the vote was narrowly lost ) . #% Obviously nobody within this House would condone a breach of the regulations or rules . #% Many of the prisoners transferred in November 2005 from the European black site prisons are now in unknown black hole prisons elsewhere . #% With regard to the Commissioner 's difficulty with + / -5 000 tonnes , I would say to you , Commissioner , that this was a pragmatic solution . #% In whose interest was it to depart in this piece of fast-track legislation from tried-and-tested procedures and the practice of using objective performance criteria for environmental standards ? #% I concur with the previous speaker 's comments about groups already beginning to work inside Lebanon to destabilise the country yet again . #% In fact , for the first time , specific mention was made of that doctrine whereby the Union can only operate on the powers conferred upon it by the Member States . #% It is a real shame on us and the other European institutions that we can not respond to these kinds of disasters . #% Personally , I believe a zero threshold is the only one acceptable . #% Therefore the fusion budget is a financial black hole in pursuit of an ever-receding holy grail of fusion energy . #% Finally , on the knowledge society , it is very clear that we need to convert our thinking , not just at a technological but also at a social level . #% If that is what the rapporteur has given you , then I am happy to go along with that division . #% However , we must be committed to an end to human rights abuses in the whole region and should not lessen our criticisms of one country because of our approach to others . #% I say to you today that one slow , lingering death of one child from radiation is one too many ! #% As one of my colleagues from Ireland mentioned , it can not be taken in isolation because of the amount that Ireland exports . #% Mr President , before I start I should like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council , Minister Fitzgerald , to the House . #% Madam President , I agree with the two former speakers that this is an annual report of the first rank and of the highest political order . #% So the life of these communities rests in a proper appraisal of their needs and their voice needs to be heard . #% I am extremely concerned about this issue , because once again Europe is trying to bring in and implement a draft regulation that tries to make one suit fit all . #% With a little more effort by the political establishment in Ireland , a ` yes ' vote could easily have been obtained but now that the referendum has taken place , many people , including supporters of the Nice Treaty , will be reluctant to overturn it . #% I think it is the Presidency that stands indicted tonight for their absence . #% We are codecision makers , colegislators in this regard . #% This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently . #% We hope he will soon be back with us . #% I have been at a meeting where they invited the scientists to come and look at the Irish Sea and the scientists would not even come and look at it . #% Mr President , there is no justification under Euratom for allowing the Commission to extend the Euratom loan by EUR 2 billion , as proposed in November 2002 , bringing the loan up to EUR 6 billion altogether . #% While I am opposed to Amendments 2 , 7 and 12 , my biggest problem is with Amendment 26 , which proposes that all NGOs , regardless of the legitimacy of their interests or the transparency of their constitutions , should be granted the right of unfettered instigation of court proceedings against Community institutions for their administrative acts or omissions , such as in enforcing the implementation of EU environmental law . #% The Resolution calls for the Commission to conduct a full impact assessment of the EU 's policies and programmes in the areas of agriculture , development and trade in order to guarantee a coherent , sustainable policy approach to global food security . #% Finally , I have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place . #% Madam President , I would like to join the chorus of praise for our Ombudsman . #% In this regard the Irish Government and authorities are not at fault . #% At present , the funding is decidedly inadequate if we are to attempt seriously to meet the commitments entered into at the Essen European Summit in 1994 . #% I feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU . #% If we want to play a role in this and want to be seen as honest brokers , then all Member States should follow the recommendation of this report and grant visas to the Taiwanese President and members of the government for private visits to the EU . #% Indeed , I can give you a list of other areas where there are serious problems . #% This imbalance is very clear in my own country , Ireland , and I would like to dwell on that for a minute , if I may . #% I wish to raise one concern , however , with regard to beef imports into the EU . #% We have made mistakes and we should recognise those mistakes and put those mistakes right sooner , rather than later . #% We would all welcome the setting of standards of quality for blood products . #% I believe that any alternative to that would handicap the development of the sector , which has significant commercial potential . #% The only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research . #% Droughts and floods in particular are the direct result of environmental neglect and mismanagement : they are manmade . #% The Commission should adopt a communication on children ' s rights to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention and create a children ' s policy unit . #% First , I think the Council is too big : 47 members are too many . #% It is worth noting that those countries which are currently net beneficiaries are situated to the south and the west of the Union and , as a result , they are likely to benefit far less from enlargement than the already better-off countries in central and northern Europe , which will be better able to take advantage of their proximity to the markets in these new Member States . #% I was a member of a local council for many years and I did not think it would take so long for the various Member States to coordinate action in this area . #% Too often in the past the Commission presented Parliament with a long list of planned initiatives covering a wide range of policy areas . #% Mining companies need to establish decommissioning plans for new and existing mines and tailing ponds . #% Mr President , the continued increase in air traffic , which is expected to double over the next decade , is placing unprecedented pressure on air travel safety . #% By the way , Iraq currently has a GM ban . #% We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices . #% 
We are all aware of the success the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has had over the last five years in confiscating the proceeds of crime . #% It would be very regrettable if Japan , for example , were to surpass us in the new technologies which we have developed and researched over many years . #% This has led to a situation in Europe where TB is not the persistent threat is once was . #% In the limited time at my disposal , I want to concentrate on his proposal in paragraph 6 for the carrying out of a feasibility study into the establishment of a military and police unit responsible for keeping and restoring the peace . #% A considerable number of actions to fight cyber-crime are already under way in international fora . #% Commissioner , I am very interested in what you said . #% I wonder why it has not already been circulated to Members , as I believe it has already been circulated to the industry ? #% Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III . #% We must therefore coordinate these . #% The message to the public with regard to biotechnology must be balanced and devoid of emotion , unlike much of what has happened so far in the area of biotechnological research . #% I would like the President-in-Office to reaffirm his commitment to continue this kind of process to find the best way of ensuring that people know exactly what we do and what we do not do at European level . #% In this context I welcome the decision by the Palestinian National Union to reaffirm the nullification of the provisions of the Palestinian National Charter , which called for the destruction of Israel . #% I must confess a conflict of interest at the start . #% As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity . #% European Community policies have promoted the development of the sheepmeat industry , but wool is another product that it is possible to develop and add value to . #% In the last few days , following many meetings , including briefings from UK ministers , we have seen some positive developments . #% We do not need to develop them : we already have these weapons of destruction . #% In particular , his efforts to achieve a consensus have led to the Socialist Group 's amendments - both to strengthen the ` must carry ' provisions and to give stronger rights of access to disabled users - being carried in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% Ignoring this problem and not providing the facilities and treatment that are needed costs Europe three to four per cent of our GDP per year . #% Next it will be income tax and fiscal harmonization . #% Finally , there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address . #% We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta , umbilical cord and adult stem cells . #% The President-in-Office spoke very passionately this morning about her concerns but , as Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out , these concerns were no surprise to a great many of us . #% There is such a broad consensus for her report in the ENVI Committee that practically all amendments tabled were adopted , making the report somewhat long and repetitive in places . #% I trust that all governments will be urged to accept that necessity . #% What is happening to him and has that case been raised by the Council ? #% I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so . #% The hormone issue was decided by the European Union some years ago not on the basis of science but rather on emotion . #% These chemical substances are known to be very toxic , persistent and bioaccumulative . #% I am satisfied that the EU is committed to safeguarding the interests of its farmers and in this regard I believe that Commissioner Fischler has shown credible leadership . #% This is highly regrettable because , in the eyes of many , it is felt that the targets set by the Kyoto Accord will not even achieve the goal of substantially reducing the use of greenhouse gases . #% I do not wish to repeat all the comments made on the situation in Northern Ireland , but I believe it is important to realize that events there in recent days are an offence against the European ideal . #% In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation . #% For example , we need a code of conduct on arms exports . #% We must recall that the European Union has been a success because the interests and concerns of both the smaller and the larger Member States are respected within the institutional structure in Europe . #% I particularly welcome the demands that nuclear decommissioning funds be fully subject to EU competition law . #% As it is currently proposed , CCCTB would mean the redistribution of European profits across the EU , so a country like Ireland , which exports a lot of what it produces , would be penalised because the profits , of course , would be at the point of sale . #% It is still not too late for the Sinn Féin leadership to rectify this failure , provided it has the commitment to do so . #% The EU demands traceability , cross-compliance and food security from its farmers , and rightly so , but in return it is threatening to break its promises , causing huge uncertainty in the agricultural community , and it is proposing to sell out its primary food producers for a quick-fix deal . #% Ultimately , these new structures will be able to help resolve cross-border disputes for aggrieved consumers within the European Union . #% Can I ask you for one assurance , one guarantee at least , that when your proposals finally come before us , you will not allow the sale of quotas across national borders ? #% They prepared a boat for them and they would not even go out in the boat . #% One of the key factors in assessing the work programme is to verify that the ideas and proposals put forward in it respond to the current needs of the citizens of the European Union . #% The European Union is not simply about mutual economic progress . #% It may be a reduction of 8.5 % in the fishing fleet but it is a reduction of at least 18 % in capacity . #% If that opinion was that , in some way , a ` one size fits all ' approach to the social model is required , then that opinion is wrong . #% I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to . #% Here , we are talking about balance and the need to get it right . #% For that reason I felt both challenged and privileged to work on this report . #% The current healthy state of the Irish economy , including a labour market which has increased by 10 % over the last 5 years , has meant that our dependency ratio is actually improving . #% I share these concerns and I share some of the real concerns held by many people , and I understand them . #% The specific proposal is part of a number of measures presently being proposed by the Committee on Transport of this Parliament to improve the quality and safety standards of air travel for all users . #% In fact in 1967 when the last outbreak occurred , the type of farming we have now did not exist . #% Mr President , that situation can not continue and needs remedying . #% The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination . #% Earlier this year , we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers , without any regard for the lives or well-being of citizens who , in my view , are used as pawns by all sides , resulting in 90 000 dead . #% Europe needs to set an example if it is to insist on other parts of the world following its lead . #% It is the first COP -- I accept that -- and perhaps we will not have as much to report as we would like because we are only developing structures and strategies to deal with this most important issue . #% On a final point , I believe that the quaestors asked you to take those signing-in sheets inside Parliament but that you refused . #% Education and training needs to be improved and the number of women in higher level education needs to be increased in order to afford them the opportunity to become more involved in politics . #% I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today , in the clearest terms , to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union . #% We are also very well aware that good progress in this whole area is being made under the Irish presidency where there is a passionate attachment and a very positive experience of progressing film production . #% We can not just let it remain outside Parliamentary control although it has been useful in some respects . #% I would also like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that I asked the Director of the UK Neurofibromatosis Association to provide Members of Parliament with information during the patenting directive debate , and that she was subsequently censured by the Charities Commission for this action . #% I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur and all the draftsmen on their work on what may appear to be a very simple topic but , when you get into the detail and analysis of it , proves extremely difficult . #% What is happening here is that we have looked at all sides of it and we have come down , on balance , in favour of employment . #% 
My final point is that I do not support - and I made this point previously - genetic engineering as it applies to humans . #% He has not gone back and told fishermen around the Irish Sea that the European Commission is trying to persecute them or to do them an injustice . #% In particular : the patenting of the human genome ; human cloning in its various forms ; the manipulation and modification of the human germ line - which is a particular concern - and the creation and use of human embryos in research . #% We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments . #% As I see it , the Germans have no objection to this woman being released on bail but the objection comes from the British Government - quite unnecessarily so , given the treatment this woman is receiving . #% Therefore you have to go down in a lift to the ground floor and cross across the buildings outside or inside and get to another lift and go up there to get from one side of the building to another . #% But we can only imagine the trauma that she has suffered with a death sentence hanging over her head throughout the past year . #% If the Commissioner could come forward with an idea of being the collator of information , at least we could then say that there is 10 % or 12 % or 50 % , instead of using guess-work or guess-figures as regards the extent of disease , illness or disability prevalent in our Union . #% Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever . #% Madam President , I congratulate Mr Viola on his report . #% I will deal with the future , because that is important in terms of the review . #% In Agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development . #% On the Kurdish issue , a guerrilla war using terrorism continues in the south-east -- a Kurdish area of Turkey -- and must be condemned . #% This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning . #% It is even worse that EU governments fail to practice what they preach . #% Additionally , if we are to learn any lessons from the current debacle and disarray in which the European Union finds itself , then the European Convention and the subsequent IGC have to consider the arguments advanced at the heart of this report . #% The exploitation of natural resources has become unsustainable , with the developed industrialised nations dominating the acquisition of resources . #% We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives . #% The new President-in-Office , Tony Blair , in his speech to the European Parliament -- and what a marvellous production that was ; obviously the diplomats had got at him , or it , since the summit -- rightly focused on this as a priority and on the illiberal so-called European social model , which protects the privileged and does nothing to create jobs and investment or increase economic growth . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his tremendous work on this report . #% The one plea I would make , and we have already asked Parliament 's Constitutional Affairs Committee to deal with this question with some urgency , is that before us now is the responsibility , among other things , to begin to implement one major part of the structural economic reform programme of Lisbon , namely to create a single European market for financial services . #% I too am concerned about diluting and weakening the European Union through too quick enlargement , although I am encouraged by progress towards monetary union . . #% Likewise , there can not be a simple free-market area , where everyone can do whatever they wish , without any restrictions . #% The directive should explicitly propose a system of support and advantages for the small and medium-sized companies in decentralised production and distribution of renewable energies . #% My biggest concern relates to who is monitoring the control bodies and who is checking the auditors . #% Indeed , often , women from less developed countries come to the EU and work in low skilled jobs , or even illegal employment . #% I accept that we ought not to increase prices indefinitely and we should relate it to area aid or the number of people on the land who protect the environment and maintain the rural fabric . #% I have studied this report and can see no reason to put in any amendments to it . #% The vision of the founding fathers of Europe has been further realised as a direct consequence of the accession of ten new countries into the Union . #% On a related issue , it is important to note that some concerns had been expressed that the applicant countries would have been able to export food products which were not up to current EU food safety standards . #% Mr President , I wish to compliment those who are still here after this long debate , in particular Mr Dini and Mr Santer . #% I have been here for the last 16 years and I am at least entitled to the respect of the House . #% However , serious action is needed , and , to begin with , we need to examine what is known as ` demand-side ' management . #% In fact I would go further and say that the EU Convention runs the risk of blurring the enlargement process . #% The current directive on money laundering is clearly ineffective given the scale of this drug problem in the cities mentioned and in other areas and also the ease with which the proceeds appear to be laundered into legitimate businesses . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his very clear reply to the oral question . #% For example , during the present global fight against terrorism we have , on occasions , turned a blind eye to the shortcomings of the undemocratic regimes we have enlisted to support us . #% I conclude by saying that I have no time for the arguments of those who view enlargement in selfish nationalist budgetary terms . #% In January , an Irish Christian Brother , Father Larry Timmons , was killed by the police , having attempted to speak out against the corruption and irregularities associated with the distribution of ID cards for the forthcoming election . #% The notion that most people want judges , well-dressed lawyers and fine courtrooms as a setting to resolve their disputes is no longer correct . #% I believe that Members of this House can play a role in communicating effectively and without panic what is happening throughout the European Union and why we are taking action . #% That is a practical measure of the potential if we can get the policies and methods right . #% Sugar beet growing and sugar processing have a long tradition in my country , dating back almost 80 years . #% Afghanistan 's vast opium fields are feeding a multi-million dollar drugs business . #% Farmers are being asked to make further reductions and sacrifices , despite being told that the 1999 reform constituted a final settlement on the CAP . #% We must also ask for effective coordination between the Gárdai , the revenue commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare . #% The setting of a common base is intrinsically linked to a harmonised rate . #% Since the recommendation , we have seen scientific research and conclusions change and evolve as well as significant technological developments using EMFs such as WiFi and Bluetooth . #% Despite Commissioner Fischler being very dismissive of this when he presented his proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development last month , I still hold firmly to my view . #% It may upset the consensus here this morning , and I do not mean any offence by this , but could many of the new Members of this Parliament even name the Ombudsman ? #% I should also like to thank the people in the Commission responsible . #% Are they not concerned ? #% There are many oppressive regimes , such as Turkey and Indonesia , which could take advantage of this . #% We want to see them either released or for them to be formally charged and receive an immediate and fair trial . #% That is what the House is voting for . #% In part , the Santer Commission , ironically , has become a victim of its own willingness to examine fraud and corruption within the Commission . #% Does this mean we are giving up and accepting the dire prediction in the 2005 Green Paper ? #% That has now changed , and the common position now includes a breakdown of funding by programme and , in some cases , within programmes . #% I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted . #% By way of explanation , consider the following quotes : #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for the outline of the situation . #% The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland . #% To its credit , the Commission has proposed a far more comprehensive and important cut in fleet capacity than the Council was ever able to accept . #% Let me say that I understand the general thrust of this report is to ensure that we prevent distortion of competition while achieving a fair and level playing field . #% Nevertheless , discard is not only about juvenile catches but is also about the harm done to fish stocks . #% They are all denied by the IRA , by word and by deed , on a regular basis . #% 
I am very disappointed that this very important issue is not further up the agenda . #% I would like to know what commitment the President-in-Office intends to show to ensure that EU policies will always give special priority to assisting peripheral and island regions , including those regions on the Atlantic coast . #% I have to say that it can not bring in closures and tie-ups to help recovery without compensation , as this will not work . #% I would like to make the following recommendations to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention . #% As the previous speaker pointed out the ideal is approximately 0.7 % . #% I totally disagree with Mrs Baldi . #% Mr President , I also rise to oppose referral back to committee . #% The other issue - Kaliningrad - is also directly linked to enlargement . #% The Annual Report is an essential tool in assessing the activities of the Cohesion Fund . #% Mr President , the essentials have been covered , but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission . #% Ritalin is the most widely prescribed drug for children in the US . #% The European Parliament today must send a very strong message out to General Musharraf that his recent actions violate all respected international conventions and he is moving Pakistan in a very negative and very dangerous direction . #% They are used in all sorts of applications , some essential , others less so : in insulating foams , aerosols , refrigeration and air conditioning systems , in fire protection equipment and even in the soles of air technology jogging shoes . #% Will Turkey be a participant in the process ? #% That is the first step : reply to the letters of the Commission . #% But we must also ensure that small software developers are not faced with a minefield of trivial patents . #% And , is it any wonder that there is such a glaring gulf between the European citizen and the European Union , when the policies we pursue disenfranchise people . #% Mr President , we can write all we like about human rights and we can report and discuss the issue , but unless we follow through on our intentions and the reports , they are meaningless . #% The markets are reasonably stable and the Berlin ceilings are not threatened . #% One of the key elements we in the European Union must focus on is our relationship with the countries to the east of the existing European Union borders . #% So we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region . #% This was despite their not having the exact qualifications laid down elsewhere in the directive . #% Parliament has to accept that EMU is going to proceed according to the timetable . #% It is also clear that industrial fish catches contain an unknown quantity of edible and even valuable fish . #% They were extremely courteous . #% What is required from the EU is to recognise what has happened and to support the work to date of the Arab League , for example , which initiated a dialogue in Khartoum on 22 June between the Transitional Federal Government institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts , which controls the south . #% I see it as imperative that all future legislative impact assessments should take into account the increasing level of global competition . #% Nothing I have heard in this debate would cause me to change my mind . #% A further shocking waste of resources , Commissioner , is that women in technical , scientific and information technology fields are squandering their skills . #% If we go down the route of denying basic human rights and basic democratic rights to those we suspect of terror , then we are giving them a victory and we are shaping a society which in the long run will not be in the best interests of the people of this world who want to live in a sustainable peace . #% My colleague , Mrs Scallon is not here because we understood President Nicole Fontaine to say at the end of the beef debate that the Smet and Hughes reports would be taken tomorrow . #% It is important that the fund plays a role as an incentive to less film-friendly banking countries to participate in film financing , to take a risk , to take a gamble , to take a toss at producing something so that they might ultimately not just be very proud of their own involvement but also it might actually make some money for them as well . #% This is an affront to individual and collective dignity and it gives us at least 15 million reasons why we should carry on with the project that you have highlighted here today , Mr Prime Minister . #% The European Union has a special responsibility to insist on that through dialogue . #% I understand now that all the political groups have agreed to this being removed . #% There are many fledgling industries , such as the rape-seed oil industry , that need to be financially promoted and supported . #% I am in some difficulty regarding a particular case because it is sub judice . #% Without a clearer definition of what is meant by this , the Green Group can not support the report . #% It is in contradiction with Article 153 . #% It is crystal clear that the species is under threat of extinction unless decisive action is taken . #% I support initiatives at European level which contribute to the efforts of Member States to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector . #% in writing . - Mr Leichtfried should be commended for a thorough and conclusive report , which had dealt effectively with many of the issues left open by the Commission paper . #% The common agricultural policy has been radically reformed , and this morning 's vote basically gives truth to the lie that if we reduced all EU agriculture subsidies the poor in Africa would be better off . #% I commend the rapporteur and his report . #% I would like you to give us the real reason for this delay and also to bear in mind that in Madrid in 1995 it was decided that negotiations would start with Malta six months after the end of the IGC . #% Complementary and alternative medicines , where scientifically substantiated , must be included in any Community action programme in the field of health . #% I greatly welcome that , but one has to recognise that , without real governmental commitment , the full potential can never be achieved . #% That is what happened in this case . #% Discrimination on the grounds of age is one of the aspects covered in this regard in the Irish presidency paper . #% Time for deliberation will be needed if we are to address the complex issues and concerns which arose during the referendum debate . #% We owe it to our European passengers to increase our knowledge and science in this area . #% I would like the President-in-Office to continue to put pressure on the Commission to have the moral courage to stand up to this awful situation which is staring us all in the face . #% Hours spent discussing better regulation and relations between the Commission and the European Parliament come to nothing if they are disregarded in this House by the Commission and Commission spokespersons . #% In fact , the whole question of why some people choose to deal with life through the haze of drugs , why some people become addicted and others do not , is also part of the issue we have to face . #% There are a number of key things we can do in the coming Council meeting to try and drive things forward . #% It lacks the characteristics of good tax law , which should be simple to understand , easy to collect , predictable in its statutory implications and difficult to evade . #% They can not understand why we impose on ourselves international impotence in the face of the conflicts that surround us in the world at large . #% It is important that , in the transatlantic dialogue , we continue to champion the values and the desire for sustainability that we all share and believe in . #% It is the last one on our schedule today and it is not a coincidence that it has been taken out of turn . #% There must be a parity of esteem between the different sides of the argument ; there must be respect for the divergence of opinion ; but , most importantly of all , we must never forget that lives have been sacrificed needlessly because people refused to talk to each other on an equal basis and on an equal footing . #% We really have to do something more than just adopting resolutions . #% It has been well documented that air transport is a very safe mode of transport and this should , and must , remain the case . #% The EU exports about 500 , 000 live animals annually . #% It is clear that , in the form presented , the mergers and acquisitions ( takeovers ) directive , has now fallen . #% As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever . #% I want to warn against that because we in the Committee on Budgetary Control used to see ourselves as working with the Commission for the improvement of the management of our resources . #% 
If half or one-third of what he wrote is true , then Sinn Féin / IRA has a serious problem about controlling what is happening in the communities it says it represents . #% However , we will have to ensure that the burden of admitting these new countries , all of whom will be net beneficiaries from the EU budget for the foreseeable future , must be shared equally by the existing Member States . #% When we speak about a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities , our main focus is always on legislation , on new innovation with regard to buildings or access to transport . #% It seems to me quite appalling that we have a situation in Europe where people are so desperate that they have to put themselves into the hands of criminals in order to try and find a new life in Europe . #% Can Mrs Schreyer confirm that ? #% I can assure the Members of this House that in doing so , the French National Front was abusing the Irish flag and everything it stands for . #% The recent Irish Permanent tsb/ESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by 2.1 % between January and May 2007 and a further decline in Ireland is expected . #% At the moment the Israelis are insisting that their ban on contacts with those who meet Yasser Arafat also applies to people from within the European Union . #% Huge numbers of EU citizens choose to take supplements to reduce the possibility of their falling ill and needing to seek medical advice to obtain prescribed drugs . #% The issue is that there is an opt-out and it is wholly predictable that the UK has reservations , as you said in your letter . #% In that way , if people look at the screen to see how we voted , they will not know . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible at a global level to achieve the dream of democratic global governance . #% Is it because that presidency is afraid of offending the United States by saying something at that country would take offence ? #% It is estimated that around 20 000 young Africans have been brought to Europe to play football but now live in the EU illegally because they did not secure a career as a football player . #% The struggle against dictatorship must be linked to the struggle for genuine socialist change in China , whereby the vast wealth and resources in China are taken into democratic public ownership and the economy is democratically planned to raise the living standards of ordinary people . #% I also welcome the decisions to place all relevant scientific committees under the authority of DG XXIV and to establish a new unit on the assessment of public health risks and the inspection of foodstuffs also under DG XXIV . #% They exchange their money at the rate that the Euro gives them . #% The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia , which I support without reservation . #% It is going to very difficult for us to justify our position . #% What is common to all the public utilities across Europe is the fact that they were originally established to ensure there was a social equality with regard to the distribution of services . #% Our citizens want more Europe . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his brief response . #% A working group has been set up in Europe to bring forward conclusive proposals on the basis of draft regulations which have been drawn up , so that a level playing field can be reached on this issue . #% We are in the process of ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty which includes a special chapter on unemployment and we are introducing this new coordinated path of having national employment plans submitted to Brussels to be assessed by the Commission and evaluated at the end of the first year . #% It is completely unacceptable that some Member States have a very good integrated coastal zone management strategy and plans , whereas other countries do not . #% However , it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise . #% With regard to the EU operational programme for forestry and the generous funding available for afforestation , it is imperative that the end product of this investment is a quality , sustainable forest product , one capable of yielding over time a return both for the individual farmer and the community . #% I had also hoped that I would have a chance to personally thank President Gil-Robles because he has been a continual support to me in my work as mediator for abducted children , and also to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work as European Ombudsman . #% Mr President , important as this debate is , it pales into insignificance when compared with the atrocious terrorist attacks in my capital city today . #% On this latter point , I note that Belgium is the only Member State still to ratify the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil aspects of child abduction and I would urge it to do so immediately . #% Please protest on behalf of all of us . #% Collectively we must defend our rights to choose when and how to engage , or isolate , regimes such as those in Cuba , Libya , Iran or elsewhere . #% It is a matter for the Cypriot people and the Turkish people to find a solution themselves . #% I fully support this programme and commend this report . #% So , we should stand in solidarity with the right of all people in Lithuania , in Russia , throughout the European Union , and elsewhere , to live in peace and in accordance with their own identities . #% As you know , the Assembly has been shut down for some time , so it is even more important that a clear signal is given that this programme will continue . #% The time has come for us to take a long-term rather than just a 6-months to 12-months view . #% I also wish to welcome Commissioner McCreevy to his first Question Time in Parliament and to re-emphasise at the outset that I am fully in favour of the Lisbon Strategy and objectives because they can create greater wealth and employment within the European Union . #% That is why I do not support it . #% Coming as I do from a small island state similar to Malta , I can testify to the EU 's commitment to the development of small and underdeveloped peripheral regions . #% Madam President , cadmium is a dangerous chemical . #% He is right as well to say that a concerted assessment of needs has to be made and that we have to take a more user-friendly approach when delivering information and practical support for the operations of EEIGs . #% In addition to being a day set aside for religious observance , Sunday is also a day dedicated to family responsibilities and to recreation . #% Efficient public administrations are necessary not only to enact new EU laws completely , but also to ensure that the Community 's financial resources are used effectively . #% Then we will have a future . #% A proper UN force is needed and it is needed quickly with a proper mandate . #% The European agricultural model , based on family farms , in my view provides the infrastructure necessary to give our consumers quality and choice . #% In my area in the Irish Sea we now face , for the third year running , the closure of the fishing area for six weeks . #% It was with some regret then that one noticed that , if there was a delay , it was among your ` line managers ' from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers . #% I believe it was very fitting that John Hume , who has played a most significant role in getting the peace process to where it is today , should have been our main speaker . #% I strongly support efforts to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion so that the new programme is not delayed any further . #% The European Union should engage in the reconstruction of Iraq and in a situation where the United Nations is at the centre of this effort . #% I also believe that the WTO is the best structure to open up competition in the industrial services and trading sectors . #% The cost of the EU enlargement will be borne from within the budgetary parameters of the Berlin Agreement . #% Mr President , we understand the reasons why Commissioners Lamy and Fischler can not be with us this afternoon . #% The lack of transparency in most Member State processes to determine their first NAPs has resulted in legitimate questions and concerns on the validity of the data within the first set of plans . #% In its initial communication , the eight biophysical criteria proposed by the Commission to assess the classification of areas with significant natural handicaps were undoubtedly biased towards the warmer and drier climates of continental Europe . #% These same people , of course , are those who would have been quite content to allow Saddam 's tyranny to continue undisturbed . #% Job losses are mounting in the airline industry . #% We need a level playing field for conservation measures taken against small fishing fleets and those taken against deep-sea fishing . #% We should also remember that whatever laws or whatever rules we make will apply to an enlarged Community where economic convergence will be much less than what it is today . #% Finally , the elimination of transaction costs is good news for the Irish tourism industry as the costs of travel and the costs of holidays are greatly reduced . #% As a result , many moderate-thinking Muslims see certain efforts being made to combat terrorism as adding to the problem and fuelling fundamentalist thinking , rather than providing an effective solution . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber . #% Surely this is a prime example of where we can achieve best practice among ourselves by all Member States ratifying the relevant conventions and promote best practice externally or globally by , as the Commission itself suggests , setting an example by ratifying the up-to-date conventions . #% 
We will indeed leave a terrible inheritance to our children if we do not ensure that the current situation changes . #% The EU Member States must not falter when it comes to fulfilling their commitments in the framework of the European Consensus on Development . #% Mr President , I was part of the delegation with Mr Spencer and Mr Linkohr at the conference in Buenos Aires . #% That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard . #% Is this the Pauline Green who , in January , defended collegiality ? #% Perhaps they are telling me whoppers in my home country ! #% Your personal efforts and the work with the High Representative , Commissioner Patten and others , particularly in Macedonia , where the situation remains so explosive and difficult , show impressive commitment towards pressing ahead with a common foreign and security policy . #% One of the things which surprised me in preparing this reply to the honourable Member 's question was that we were not able in the short time available to determine or even make an accurate estimate which I could give to the House of the number of alcoholics within the European Union . #% There is at times an attitude in some European quarters to the effect that ` we know best ; we will bring about the appropriate changes and the people will thank us for them later ' . #% What sort of world will we leave to the next generation ? #% The American Government could be boosting the armaments or the oil industries at home or it could be geared towards the re-election prospects of President George Bush , à la Margaret Thatcher . #% We questioned Commissioners Liikanen , Lamy and Busquin and we went to the hearings of de Palacio , Patten and Wallström . #% We export 90 % of our entire production , be it processed or live . #% We have worked hard scrutinising the strategy papers prepared by the Commission and to formulate positions on different aspects of those strategies . #% Until genuine economic equality has been achieved the Commission must be extremely careful not to impose rigorous harmonisation which could lead to a reversal of gains already made . #% I have experienced this myself and I know how urgent it is to get this resolved for people in Europe . #% The UN is the accepted custodian of international law , with unique structures and processes to uphold it . #% Effectively what we are voting for is something which will not , in fact , be the law after Ecofin has made its changes . #% I welcome the fact that EU Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU ' s emission of six greenhouse gases by 8 % between the years 2008 and 2012 . #% The latest text allows a situation whereby the collection of fees will continue to apply to those activities that are currently subject to fees -- i.e. meat and fishery products inspection , veterinary residue testing , and controls on live animals . #% Secondly , the European Union should use all its weight in highlighting this crisis at the meeting of the UN Security Council in Nairobi . #% Now the question arises , how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan ? #% Regarding energy , equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required . #% As well as deeper knowledge , we need wider knowledge . #% What can we do to ensure that they are not excluded from society , and what can we do to help them ? #% We are prepared to judge each on his or her individual merit in the belief that not all were personally responsible for the ineptitude or incompetence of some . #% Despite our wealth , when you left office last year , we still had one of the lowest social spends in the EU . #% Dr David Nabarro , UN coordinator for avian and human influenza , has stressed that , to prevent a pandemic of human infection , the global response to the bird flu epidemic must be intensified . #% The statement protects the right of people to protest , which is one of the fundamental issues that people were very concerned about . #% I support you also , Madam President , in making space on Thursday 's agenda for a debate on this tragedy . #% The Commission and the Council should also take this advice , that it is time we sought to ensure that fish stocks remain , and not just the industry , which will have nothing to fish for in the future if it does not realise that there is a problem . #% That does not mean that we want to bring an end to subsidisation . #% It is bad for Britain , bad for Europe and will only prolong the crisis . #% The trade in wildlife in South America is also growing and wild animals such as monkeys , birds , capybara and other large rodents , as well as tapirs , armadillos and deer , are for sale . #% I have put my suggestions before you . #% We wonder how the Commission would propose to try to induce the Council , with its Article 99 privileges , to do that , and not simply to take more tax and ignore the labour taxation . #% Indeed , if Dublin II does not resolve these issues , why are we rushing them through this Parliament , in this debate , so as to accommodate the other institutions ? #% This is a clear case of the British government using the war on terrorism to distract attention from awkward and contentious decisions . #% That is the biggest disincentive to investment which will hit job opportunities . #% Finally , I want to put on the record that I object in the strongest terms to threats to the marine environment around the Irish and other north-west European coastlines posed by the so-called ` Ghost Fleet ' of clapped-out American ships being sent to British scrapyards . #% Finally , the CFSP has been one of the European Union 's key successes . #% Conditions in Zimbabwe are now spiralling out of control . #% Yet when you look at what happens in society - not just to young people but also to older people - one of the major problems we have is the abuse of alcohol , which contributes to violence in the home , violence on the streets and to serious crime . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , this regulation has been in gestation for almost two years . #% After that there will eventually be a second referendum . #% I do not believe we have . #% We want explicitly to exclude computer methods , algorithms and mathematical models from patentability , as set out in a new Article 4 . #% Also very significant was the appointment of the special envoy to the Great Lakes area . #% This decision will allow the PEACE measures , designed to support reconciliation , to be carried on for another few years . #% Which comes first : children 's health or the vested interests of industry ? #% The principle underpinning this new Community Action Programme is to create an open method of coordination between the Member States to help eradicate poverty and social exclusion . #% That is why I commend my amendment to you . #% The British Society for Human Genetics says : ' Article 5 appears both to permit and to exclude the patenting of human gene sequences . ' #% For example , companies could find it more profitable to officially relocate their headquarters to countries outside the EU and then to post their workers to their European branches to avoid having to provide the same rights and conditions for their workers that are legally applicable to EU citizens working in the EU . #% There is a positive side to this , namely safety . #% Member States will not be able to allow the registration and entry into service of light commercial vehicles if they do not have a valid certificate of conformity for this type of approval after 1 January 2007 . #% The CAP is not perfect , but it has been reformed . #% Before the terms of a final EU Treaty are agreed upon , we must ensure that cautious , careful and wide-ranging discussions take place with all interested parties from both the large and the small countries . #% It also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.7 % in the number of farms within the European Union . #% Although there have been differences within the European Union as to how best to deal with Iraq , we are all agreed now that the European Union must remain at the forefront of this reconstruction effort . #% The fact that the phasing-out of these will be based on a case-by-case review , taking into account new information on details of uses and on safer alternatives , is a constructive and realistic way to encourage the affected industries to actively seek alternatives . #% But having said that , we must also provide for the unpredictable . #% Therefore I would ask you , once again , to specifically either deny or admit that you made the statement and also to explain why you interfered in such a way ? #% Mr President , coming as I do from a small country which landfills 99 % of its waste , I am particularly anxious to make a few remarks about this extremely important directive . #% Yesterday an article was written by Jim Cusack in . #% We here in this House must express our concern for an enhancement of regional policy focus in those places because these regions will carry the most immediate consequence of enlargement . #% 
Forty per cent of travellers in my own country , Ireland , do not bother to use packages , and I know this is replicated in many other Member States . #% In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse . #% Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market . #% The US invasion of Afghanistan was undertaken not to advance the interests of the Afghan people but the geostrategic interests of the United States in Central Asia , which of course is rich in energy , oil and gas . #% In addition , the annual TACs were decided . #% UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction . #% The second was one of three cases to lift the immunity of a Member , as it happened I think from Spain . #% Pesticides are expensive commodities and farmers only use them where necessary . #% By the stealth of this proposal , it is clear that Brussels aspires to replace the nation state as the deciding authority on company taxation . #% For a lot of people , that one click is like trying to climb Everest because they have not been brought up in the information technology age and they have no access to education or training to ensure that they can make use of this wonderful new tool . #% I do not want to see any more people buried in my country on either side . #% There is therefore a general urgency and , in some parts , even a specific one . #% Mr President , as the House knows , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy was deeply divided over whether or not to ratify the third generation agreement with Pakistan . #% I recognize that even though it is a Friday morning it was on Friday mornings in this Parliament that we eventually brought this problem to the attention of the Commission . #% I wish to assure him that the common Council position , adopted on 28 October , makes provision for further restrictive measures against Burma to be considered and in this context the presidency will continue to monitor developments , including the implementation of the common position , and report regularly to the Council on this matter . #% The one thing I now see clearly is that there are no real level playing fields in agricultural production , be this organic or conventional , and I firmly believe you can only achieve this from the centre and with positive encouragement . #% Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off ? #% This is a good step forward , but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States . #% Should the Union be in a position not only to allow a Member to leave but also to expel a Member because it no longer meets the criterion , which is that it must be a democracy ? #% That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market that fluctuated from EUR 31 per tonne down to EUR 8 per tonne and back up to EUR 16 per tonne . #% It is imperative that we should avoid simplistic assertions that these atrocious killings are the results of religious hatred alone . #% These systems need to be modernised and centralised so as to guarantee that flights are not delayed because of air traffic control deficiencies . #% On that subject , the matter of paedophile priests and their victims , which affects the whole of the European Union , is one of very serious consequence to us all . #% We could draw up a whole list of the casualties and suffering caused by nuclear discharges , and immediate action should therefore be taken . #% A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt . #% From 2007 on , 1200 Irish salmon fishermen face the loss of their livelihood due to such legislative and policy changes . #% Clearly there is a lack of public consent here . #% As the leaders of the largest republican party in the six counties , and in particular after last week 's election , they have a duty to separate the cause of Irish Republicanism from the acts of common criminals . #% The former US Secretary of State , Madeleine Albright , considered 5,000 children a month as a price worth paying to get rid of Saddam Hussein . #% The practice of there being a de facto national quota for senior staff appointments in the Commission must end . #% Measures such as enhanced levels of consultation and mechanisms to quicken the resolution of disputes need to be investigated . #% The UNHCR has been very slow to react , to say the very least . #% I regret , Commissioner , that you did not fulfil your task . #% In many cases these are the local and regional authorities . #% Rare though they are for obvious reasons , the potential consequences to very large numbers of people are extremely serious . #% The conclusions of the Göteborg Summit of EU leaders with regard to the enlargement negotiations and the accession process stated that the road map should make it possible for those countries that are ready to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 . #% We propose starting with the Commission 's Year 2000 tax rate proposals and then applying an accelerator formula , subject to five-year review , but which would stay in place pending the outcome of the review . #% Neither is it possible to evaluate that role in economic terms . #% Recently , when asked how far I thought certain Members would go in foreign policy , I said I would be convinced of the intentions of colleagues when I saw Members of the Union who hold permanent seats on the Security Council of the United Nations offering one of those seats to Europe . #% One has to ask , therefore , why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it . #% The Commission has supported Turkish NGOs and professional organizations promoting human rights for a number of years , including the Human Rights Association , the Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Medical Association . #% I would like to see that broadened to include those representing the development area . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the Giegold report because there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues that arise in this report . #% I am extremely proud of your presence in the chair and of the Taoiseach 's presence here as President of the Council of the European Union for the coming six months . #% Firstly , the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment . #% But unfortunately , with the quota management system under the common fisheries policy , it is exactly what we have : first - and second-class fishermen . #% I hope I will be able to report back to these architects that the result of what we are doing here today in conjunction with the Council will contribute to the ongoing completion of the single market . #% This is a gross abuse of the freedom of the press and of the freedom to report what is going on . #% Mr President , I should like to refer briefly to the importance of forestry from a rural development as well as a family-farm perspective . #% However , the discharge of Tritium from the BNFL Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria and Chapelcross Nuclear Power Station , to mention only one discharge , is extremely large - millions of litres of tritiated water and air every year . #% Some inspectors think that it will actually have a negative effect . #% It seems to me that we must ensure that is not the commitment we bring to Lisbon , rather that we really drive forward . #% Many of our policies affect children 's rights and interests but this week Commissioner Prodi said he did not feel it was necessary to have a dedicated unit looking at children 's rights within the Community . #% I just want to say , as somebody who comes from a peripheral area of the west of Ireland , that the European rural model is seriously endangered by the various enactments of the European Union in many cases , especially in the reform of the common agricultural policy . #% That is not to forgive the atrocities that were committed or to say that the wrongs did not take place ; it is to say that you can not go on living in the past , you can not remain bitter . #% Two hours might be too much in that case , let alone four hours . #% On the question of food security and food quality , we must ensure , and I think this is important in the context of the next world trade talks , that the European Union commitment to consumer protection does not place our consumers at risk or place our industry at a competitive disadvantage . #% I disagree , for two reasons . #% The Union must continue to take structural measures to encourage balanced development around the Union and to avoid a drift to the centre by mobile investment . #% The solution lies in EU level cooperation , namely in the form of some tough legislation . #% Some trade restrictions are acceptable in view of the social environmental problems that are so obvious . #% I would ask him to give this House this evening an assurance that he will use his undoubted influence to have the matter discussed at the summit in your country next week . #% It is important to bear them in mind and we should move on with this proposal . #% I had to let him go because there was no help he could give , all on the basis of health and safety . #% This right to determine , to control , to have any say about the risk of nearby concentrations of nuclear installations is denied to those of us who inhabit the western shores of the Irish sea . #% Promoting social and educational interaction between students can only serve a positive function . #% 
Madam President , firstly let me thank Mr Prodi for this initiative today . #% I want to appeal to you to take Question 9 , which is the next one and in my name . #% Mr President , I , too , want to welcome and salute members of the McCartney family , who continue their crusade for justice outside Ireland and within it . #% The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission . #% President Santer has accepted reforms proposed by the leader of the EPLP , Alan Donnelly . #% Finally , it is important that , as newer technologies come on stream , this process must involve the consent and widespread participation of the general public and local communities . #% So it goes without saying that BSE has been a disaster for Ireland . #% Thus far , 22 countries have submitted an Annual Summary , meeting the basic minimum requirements of financial regulation , but not all are satisfactory . #% Could you please expand on that and not leave it in suspended animation ? #% Coming from a region that depends heavily on the fishing industry , I want to refer to Commissioner Byrne ' s proposals on dioxin levels . #% The system is due for a shake-up and this regulation will significantly help that process . #% I call on colleagues to bear this in mind when making proposals on this matter . #% Mr President , sadly the anti-Americanism of some in Europe is so great that I sense that some even take a perverse satisfaction from the turmoil prevailing in Iraq . #% Are these not our waters in that sense ? #% People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse . #% Scientists have been predicting a lethal cyclical resurgence of influenza for some time , one that will be more deadly because of our low levels of resistance . #% Lastly , the African Union force must be strengthened and its mandate expanded to deal more effectively with the security situation . #% . I thank the rapporteur for his hard work on this important matter . #% Already 13 out of the 15 countries in the European Union have ratified the provisions of the Treaty of Nice . #% Mr Wynn says that the Council says there is no more money : absolute rubbish ! #% The way to persuade those consumers to take the plunge is to ensure that their rights are intact and this has to include , in my group ' s view , the right to take action in their own national court . #% This report leaves that avenue open , and I therefore welcome it . #% Each of us must have concern for those who suffer the horrors of addiction and we must do all that is possible to assist them to recover from their addiction : facilitating the use of drugs is not the way to assist them . #% In the Commission 's press release in June it noted that these two aspects have been separated . #% Women are still portrayed stereotypically even if a few new stereotypes have been added . #% The tax change will lower wage expectations and therefore inflationary expectations . #% This requires an assessment of the impact of ACTA on data protection and fundamental rights . #% I am involved in several amendments . #% It has been very important because the maintenance , safety and development of our railway system throughout Europe have to be encouraged and not discouraged . #% We will not be divided or have our role as a legislature ignored . #% This issue relates to the Irish referendum . #% In conclusion , I would like to see the reprocessing of nuclear products terminated at Sellafield . #% Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing . #% ( The President urged the speaker to conclude ) I am sorry , Mr President , but I am sure you , unlike the Council , can allow a few moments for the disabled and less well-off in our society . #% in writing . - I support this resolution on Policy Coherence for Development . #% We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made . #% However , I should like to ask my colleagues in the new Member States not to give their national governments the power to decide at central government level how and where the money is to be spent . #% Mr President , I wish to raise an issue of pressing importance to the farming community in my constituency . #% The Commission , Council and Parliament know what needs to be in a framework document of that kind . #% in writing . - I voted against this motion . #% One of the lessons learned from my report on the control of the CFP was that even the EU vessels registries were not accurate . #% The scope of public services concerned covers healthcare , education , security , climate change and energy efficiency , all issues which benefit the entirety of society . #% However , the conditions must be right . #% The system should be changed . #% Mr President , could I just remind all the Members in this House that whilst we may have difficulties or disagreements with regard to procedures or undue interference directed against individual Members of the Commission or anybody else , the most important issue we are discussing here today is the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people involved in the fishing industry . #% Can I say that the European Union recognizes the need for further improvements and progress in the implementation of human rights and democratic freedoms in Turkey . #% I was incensed when , as late as yesterday , the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in ` category ' . #% Concerning the comments by the Burmese Government , they are wholly unacceptable and uncivilized in the circumstances . #% I do not think it satisfactory , even in the motion recently adopted by this House , to express the that this will happen by 2015 . #% I hope this Parliament will give a strong mandate to the Commission to carry this directive forward with renewed momentum following Thursday 's vote , and I look forward to seeing a further improved version of this directive before Parliament in the not-too-distant future . #% Passengers should not need to pay for security . #% If Mr Markov had lived in Northern Ireland he would not have come out with the rubbish he spoke tonight to try to justify the cause of provisional IRA/Sinn Féin , who are sitting behind him . #% The real problem is that the costs of producing food are rising faster , and this is a treadmill on which farmers can not continue . #% In the context of the WTO , it is vital that Europe defends the rights accrued under those regulations and does not give in to the pressures coming from third countries . #% Under the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty , the interim agreement between the European Union and the USA , signed in November 2009 , required the consent of the European Parliament . #% I hope EU governments now respond to this strong message from Parliament . #% Mr President , let me begin by endorsing much of what Mr Farage had to say in his pertinent observations about the state of trade policy . #% Turning to the Irish presidency , I am sure that Mr Ahern will remember my illustrious predecessor telling him six months ago in this House , with characteristic humour , that the most beneficial thing likely to emerge from the Irish presidency would be that Mr Ahern would have less time to meddle in the affairs of British Northern Ireland . #% If we could move away from thinking in terms of facts and figures , sums and statistics , markets and merchandise ; if we could remember at all times that our policies impact on the real lives of real people , then we would demonstrate a genuine commitment to the fundamental values we claim to cherish . #% In the short time available , I appeal to the Commission and , indeed , Parliament to urgently expedite the conclusions necessary to allay consumer fears concerning the public health , environmental and ethical aspects of a technology which has the potential to make a significant contribution to food production and public health . #% Also the proposal for a multinational approach to legal deposit may also run into linguistic difficulties . #% You can be sure that we shall be following up very carefully the sixth framework programme , visiting projects , speaking to scientists and asking for evaluations . #% CAP reform was undoubtedly sold as a means to protect agricultural tariffs from future attack . #% In this respect , the role which the market can play is particularly important . #% The five children involved were supposed to be returned to their parents on Monday , but have not been as yet . #% A recent study revealed that 40 % of young Irish adults demonstrate permanent and unsightly tooth mottling and staining related to dental fluorosis . #% 
This is not the truth . #% If I could say one last thing , it seems to me it would be very useful if we did this next September and completed the debate by December and that you , Madam President , as President of this institution , and Mr Prodi , as President of the European Commission , could go to the European Council and tell them ex ante : this is our priority for Europe . #% Mr President , I wish to bring a very important matter to your attention . #% I do not know about you , Commissioner , but that shook me . #% I do not regard that as a very democratic system and it is certainly not a system which fully reflects the views of the Members who spoke here . #% The announcement of the continued financial support from the European Union is exactly what Northern Ireland needs at this critical time . #% In this vote , Labour Euro MPs have backed the hundreds of thousands of campaigners who are actively working for a Robin Hood Tax - a tiny tax on financial transactions that can raise billions to meet priorities at home and our commitments to fighting poverty and climate change internationally . #% We should remember the experience of Maastricht . #% I do not know whether you have ever heard it described in that way : it is my personal description of the problem . #% I support the innovative approach taken by the Commission in proposing rules that will cover security measures during flights . #% Yes , the scientific jury is out , but 13 out of 23 developing countries working under the WHO guidelines have serious problems with fluoride poisoning , or fluorosis , in the dental care of their people . #% I raise it today but hasten to add that this is in no way a reflection on the qualities or capacity of the nominee Commissioner charged to deal with both of these issues in the current sphere of responsibilities . #% What is your opinion on that ? #% Of course we have to defend our democratic way of life when it is threatened by violence , but we have to do so in a way that does not deny or reduce basic human rights , not only for society in general , but for those sections of society which are alienated from society at large . #% The key question these days is not so much one of technology itself but how technology is used in a way which contributes to growth through improved productivity . #% What flexibility is going to be granted to Member States ? #% If you were to have a request from the UK Government to reinstate that ECU 175 million to use to solve the crisis and help the workers in the industry , would you be prepared to look at that favourably and would you be prepared to released those monies to the UK ? #% What you are dealing with is vitally important for all of us . #% Cedefop provides policy makers , researchers and practitioners with information to promote a clearer understanding of developments in vocational training and thus enable them to take informed decisions for future action . #% Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan , and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult . #% Perhaps it is only a problem of interpretation , but some of the suggestions for the fast-track approach seem to be saying we have to cut through some of the present legal impediments for instance with regard to the right of appeal . #% At the same time , cuts must not have a negative impact on the quality of Parliament 's legislative work . #% We had group meetings at the time and saw on the screen `` Question 41 '' . #% It also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour . #% What they all share is a desire to achieve political ends through anti-democratic efforts . #% I believe there is now too much emphasis placed and too much pressure put on such projects . #% Perhaps the emphasis could be shifted from Ecstasy smuggling to the major problems of smuggling from areas such as the triangle around Afghanistan , and via shipping routes . #% The basis of this proposal is that the discovery of any TSE or the first incidence of BSE in a Member State would be covered by common rules which would take effect automatically . #% We would instead like to see public money work more intelligently , both alongside private investment and through better public procurement . #% It is for this reason that the original resolution of the European United Left Group calls for the logging industry to be in public ownership and under democratic control , crucially involving workers in the industry and the indigenous communities in the forests affected by logging . #% Each national standards authority carries out a comprehensive and full review of all the activities of a prospective applicant under the EMAS scheme that may affect the environment . #% I believe that the importance of bees within agriculture , in broad terms , is generally undervalued , even within the sector itself . #% I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction , but an important one just the same , because it will awaken Members of this House to the importance of detail . #% I urge sensible handling of transport and the individual identification of animals . #% A prerequisite is the necessary information sharing with all parties . #% This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured . #% Mr President , I , like my colleagues , would like to congratulate both our rapporteurs on the presentation of their work . #% I would like to bring to your attention a delegation that has gone from this House to look at the construction known colloquially as ` the wall ' . #% Madam President , I want to welcome the President-in-Office and to congratulate him on his enthusiastic and competent approach to the whole business of guiding the affairs of this Union over the next six months . #% ADRs , therefore , can not be a replacement for legal remedy . #% It is harder for EU companies to compete with third party countries who do not observe the same safety standards and who can pay employees much lower salaries . #% Notwithstanding the fact that Britain will not be joining a single European currency at the first stage the benefits of economic and monetary union for Ireland far outweigh any negatives . #% Mr President , I was dismayed by President Barroso 's contribution at the end of the debate on the presidency 's programme -- particularly his defence of his intervention in Portuguese politics . #% At the moment , it is the continent most affected by AIDS . #% It also includes a litany of unreported incidents , falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel rods resulting in the loss of confidence by the Japanese in safety standards at the plant and the cancellation by the Germans and the Swiss of mixed oxide nuclear fuel pellets . #% In reality we know that regulating the e-commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach . #% I know that the Portuguese presidency is very familiar with this issue . #% Most of all , we need to have a pensions reserve fund , so that there can be inter-generational solidarity between this generation and not just the next generation but also the generation after that . #% According to the Commission , this measure was possible because opportunities had been created by the departure by a number of Far East vessels which used to target particular species . #% However , to get a 48-hour week , junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years . #% An opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act . #% In particular , I want to signal on behalf of my group an interest in the non-debate that waxes and wanes every so often about the reform of the UN Security Council . #% It is not just about lack of social security protection . #% It is an unfortunate fact of our life in this world today that many hundreds of journalists die virtually every year in pursuit of their vocation of serving and informing the public . #% The technology is there . #% However , it is also necessary that the parliamentarians represent the same European people by ensuring that there is no frivolous spending , no unnecessary price increases , and that value is found in a market where suppliers and businesspeople are fighting for every last euro . #% Self-sufficiency has to be a goal . #% It must deliver a letter , which may originate in the UK or elsewhere , regardless of the cost and regardless of what area of the country it is addressed to . #% There are a lot of circles to be squared here , less revisionism about what conditions were like in our industries years ago , and we need an honest , open dialogue . #% Let us make them legal with these rules . #% That must be spelled out also so that we do not panic the consumer into thinking that the disease is continuing to spread . #% Turkey 's position today should not be seen as a rejection by the European Union in any shape or form . #% This would be a bold step but one that can allow the European Union to increase its control , in a more realistic way , over the export of arms from European Union countries . #% Because of that , I have had an increasingly heavy work load in relation to this issue . #% It is a human imperative , but also a deeply ingrained cultural imperative in Europe . #% I should also like to thank Mr Busquin , an excellent Commissioner , who has been very skilful along with his staff in ensuring that we could get a result early in the process . #% 
Let me turn to some of the specific points in the resolution before us , which I largely welcome , although I find it rather long and verbose . #% All the institutions of the Union have to apply themselves to simplifying the regulations by which we implement European regional policy before the new programme comes in and before enlargement in four years ' time . #% Amendments to the Treaties have to be agreed by European Union leaders and any proposals emanating from this Convention must be balanced , progressive and achievable . #% I doubt very much that they could . #% The President-elect of the Commission , Mr Prodi , has certainly made it clear that he intends to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work extremely closely together on the implementation of a comprehensive work programme within the Union over the next five years . #% I know that it is very late at night and everyone is very tired but I did ask a specific question of the Commissioner and I think the Commissioner misunderstood me . #% Eventually that approach , which allows Member States to decide on the basis of river-basin management plans -- which under the Framework Directive will eventually manage all freshwater sources once they are put in place -- will also allow Member States to manage their nitrate and pesticide pollutants . #% Madam President , you will be aware that I raised the issue at the Bureau last week about a grossly intimidatory and intrusive demonstration in front of the Parliament in Brussels , so I was equally surprised yesterday to see exactly the same thing happening again . #% I believe that the citizens of Europe are demanding to know the exact responsibilities of the new political portfolios that are being created within the European Union . #% Mr President , Prime Minister , thank you for your presentation of the Spanish Presidency 's priorities . #% We need to get clarification from the Romanian authorities about these children . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report . #% Therefore I strongly support the interoperability aim of IDA and its support of community policies as outlined by Mrs Read , those that are traditional -- agriculture , employment statistics -- and those that are newer -- civil protection , humanitarian aid and justice and home affairs . #% Following on from that , I know it may not be his exact role within this House , but he may be able to enlighten us as regards the Swedish difficulties that may arise with regard to ratification of the International Criminal Court . #% That question can not be shelved . #% Beef producers were already facing heavy financial losses before the BSE crisis . #% Since I came to this House in 1984 , Wagonlit has provided an excellent service . #% It is true that agreement was reached on an increase in the financing of the trans-European networks but it is very disappointing for many of us that the money must be found from existing resources . #% The Union has , over the last months and years , infringed on people 's very basic rights , which are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights . #% We chose life two years later in a referendum to protect the life of the human person from conception to natural death . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate you on the speech you made the night the heads of government met in Brussels . #% Actions , not words alone , can cleanse the hands of those nations in Europe which have both armed and furthered the aims of terrorists and have then refused to extradite those criminals for proper trial . #% This right may be exercised in only two cases : if the contract was signed before the consumer knew the contractual terms and conditions and if he was subject to unfair pressure during the reflection period . #% The initial figure of 70 % Community participation and 30 % national participation in the Haug report , was adopted by a very large majority . #% I believe that the recent readmittance of Burma to the Asean and EU-Asean meetings was a major mistake from the start . #% If we can not even do it in our own Parliament , we should not preach to others . #% If this is the public perception I think it is outrageous . #% When the President of the Vietnamese Committee on Human Rights addressed Parliament in December , he described Vietnam as a prison for its people , governed by a red mafia financed by the European taxpayer . #% Commissioner , why did ECHO not foresee this and foresee that food was needed there when so many people were threatened ? #% If it does , nobody will have an overall view of what is happening ; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future . #% Skeletal diseases began to afflict the children and the adult populations too . #% New rules are necessary for many reasons : scientific progress in the last decade , new elements such as carbon sinks , the transboundary nature of gas emissions and the obvious need for a Community approach and the harmonisation of rules in this area . #% What I despise most is the false pretence , particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom , that this Constitution is merely a tidying-up exercise made necessary by enlargement and that it will settle the constitutional shape of Europe for generations . #% It is inevitable , given the complexity of the problem , that everyone will have some significant reservations about some part of the package . #% In particular , they should now consider bringing in flexibility with regard to the compensation payments to sugar beet growers and sugar producers who have lost their livelihoods , and targeting those resources instead towards the creation of alternative energy crops and alternative fuels . #% Unlike Mr Cunha I can not offer him a remedy for a speedy recovery , but a hot Irish whiskey is not bad for the flu either . #% There are also signs of concern in Britain about sub-prime lending . #% The European Union has to address this issue . #% Ideally , I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges . #% I welcome the focus on better research in Europe , especially as we know that 85 % of research today is without EU coordination . #% To have voted for Mr Fabre-Aubrespy 's motion of censure to sack the Commission today , at the critical juncture when the Commission needs to be capable of taking major decisions on Agenda 2000 and reform of regional grants , could have thrown this decision-making process into paralysis . #% In order to make the most of the industry 's unique selling point - the high quality of its output - we need further promotion as pointed out in the Scottà report . #% There are reports of headaches , sleep disruption and a number of other effects , which are not referred to by the Commission . #% Mr President , I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary . #% We call on those countries which possess nuclear weapons to fulfil their commitment to disarm by virtue of Article VI of the NPT . #% But I must say that I am disappointed here today that the Council have already decided and that we are debating a report when a decision has been taken . #% It is frustrating that the United States through its present stance is becoming much more part of the problem than part of the solution . #% In the UK and Ireland this little creature has been responsible for devastating woodlands as well as driving out the indigenous European red squirrel -- -- from many areas . #% I rise specifically , Mr President , to ask you to raise with Mr Uribe , the President-in-Office and the Commission the question of support for a proposed conference on humanitarian rights later this year . #% Enshrined within this process must be recognition of the role of smaller states , which must be protected within any new future institutional framework . #% These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states . #% These decisions and discussions are not taking place at an honest level within the Member States , and especially within the neutral countries : the public is being misled . #% The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators , some for toxic waste , be created in my country , thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water , air , soil , plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc . #% While subsidiarity dictates that each Member State can decide what kind of research may be carried out within its territory , we must not forget that we are talking about European taxpayers ' money here . #% Please give the Irish people the tools ; we will do the job ourselves , but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying . #% However , without prejudice to the overall support of the European Police Office , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and its effects on police cooperation , the rapporteur , and his fellow rapporteurs in the LIBE Committee , feel that there should be no amendments to the measures implementing the Europol decision until such measures can be adopted under the new legal framework provided by the Treaty of Lisbon . #% This seems to be very much in relation to the fact that the Vietnamese are trying to modernise and the modernisation costs are being basically borne by the peasant farmers . #% Finally , the Commission has already stated that action to uphold international agreements with the EU , and I am quoting , `` does not represent a sanction against Israel but demands correct implementation of existing agreements freely entered into by the parties '' . #% Now I have no difficulty with having a political argument on ideology with anybody . #% The fact that accidents in different countries can now be dealt with in the country of the injured person is a huge plus , and I congratulate the rapporteur once again . #% It considers itself the moral police force of the world and yet it carries out the most appalling crime , basically a crime against humanity , in imposing the death sentence . #% This is a proposal which is strongly supported by the artisanal fishermen in Senegal . #% In this crisis the European Commission must move immediately to reintroduce to Parliament and Council the draft directive on manning conditions for ferries , which this Parliament approved in its first stage in 1999 and which has since been blocked by the Council . #% There will be a 17 % increase in the number of tuna vessels , from 57 to 67 . #% I would hope that the Council will take this issue very seriously and not give in to pressure , despite the fact that there may be some countries in the European Union that would wish to do so . #% Similarly , there are tens of thousands of unpaid carers whom we should be supporting for the valuable work they are doing , but whom your government treats like Oliver Twist asking for more . #% 
Restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinian leadership does not contribute to fighting terror . #% If BNFL had such a blue chip record in the field of public health and public safety why do lobsters along some parts of the east coast have levels of contamination 247 times greater than was the case only in 1993 ? #% This would involve a more regional approach to food aid , helping specific regions to build up their food-producing infrastructure . #% But consider for a moment the plight of the millions of people in long-term unemployment and the many people who have never had a job and who struggle through life in dire poverty . #% Individuals are not being treated as individuals , they are being treated as groups coming from the country concerned . #% As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP , this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who authoritatively speaks for the EU in this field . #% The current LIFE III programme is due to finish at the end of 2006 when a new package , LIFE + , will be introduced as part of our new Financial Perspective on which we await a Council decision . #% This is an issue that will have to be resolved if the European Union is to have any effective role in the region . #% We have also seen the success of the internal market in terms of net job creation . #% Madam President , I was told quite explicitly that I had to be present to indicate that I wanted to make a written explanation of vote . #% I support both those ideas . #% We are all agreed that the way forward is through the democratic process . #% It supports the militarisation of Europe - something I do not support . #% From the Minister 's reply , I take it that assistance in this area would be an immediate priority as part of the EU 's monitoring of issues in relation to persons with mental disabilities in Romania . #% I would like some sort of assurance from the Council that this will not actually happen because it is an interference in the democratic process of a Member State . #% We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves . #% As Mr Bertens said , Parliament supports the initiatives taken by the eight countries in the New Agenda Coalition . #% Also there is a suggestion that Continental AG is putting obstacles in the way of selling the plant to another company or to a management/workers buy-out . #% I have to say that , expressions of concern apart , there do not appear to be any concrete proposals . #% The financial crisis , driven by unscrupulous financial speculators , who continue to make vast fortunes , whose activities have brought the world economy to its knees , need to be circumscribed . #% We must look not simply at the quality of water but at its location , its availability , and how it is managed . #% The honourable Member will understand from my previous answers that the European Union , and certainly the Council of Ministers , sees possibilities for developing relations with Albania and influencing it in that way . #% I will oppose strongly any attempts to turn that review into a reform . #% The one area of concern I have is in relation to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers - ICANN . #% This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance , the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen , rather than dictate . #% Mr President , the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed less than 18 months ago by all the Heads of State and Government . #% Thank you , John , you have done an excellent job . #% I hope that you are successful -- Europe needs you to be successful . #% Mr President , this report takes on an even wider significance following the tragic events in Yugoslavia and Kosovo , right in the heart of Europe . #% Bearing in mind that it is the Commission that is ultimately the guardian of the Treaties , what steps is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States fully apply all these criteria ? #% Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely . #% I would highlight one special case in this regard : the situation of the lime industry . #% The modification to the regulation seeks to permit and extend this possibility targeting low income households in all Member States . #% Mr President , the Greek Government assumed presidency of the Union at a time of great international uncertainty and political instability . #% I fully support the aims of rural development but I firmly believe that direct payments are a key element in keeping alive small family holdings and maintaining rural communities right across Ireland . #% The Committee also intends to introduce a leverage ratio to help contain excessive build-up of leverage in the system and other supplementary countercyclical measures such as capital buffers to be built in good times . #% These fears must be addressed as must also the wish to see the introduction of an accelerated timetable for the introduction of universal suffrage . #% If that is true , I should then like to suggest that we change our order of business for today and , respecting the 24-hour deadline , I would ask the rapporteur , Mrs Buitenweg , to introduce her report at 3 p.m. , followed by a debate , urgencies and then the vote , which would fully respect the 24-hour deadline . #% I appeal to you , Mr President , to ensure that we proceed in that way . #% We have become starkly aware of more frequent and more severe natural disasters across the EU and the world . #% Secondly , such a programme would be extraordinarily difficult to monitor or control . #% I had better clarify the first part of my answer . #% A final comment : I could not sit down without mentioning our deep concern about Chechnya . #% I hope that the record of this House will show very clearly where we stand in relation to this question . #% If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising . #% Therefore , in this context , given the wide variation of climatic conditions across Europe , I consider it appropriate that decisions regarding the health and safety of workers from exposure to sunlight are best taken by the national authorities . #% The people of Europe recognise that they are protesting not against America , but against President Bush and against war . #% That is the law in my Member State and in the UK and we wish to continue that practice . #% I am sorry to have to raise this issue , but it is becoming a bit of a problem for us , and I notice that quite a number of colleagues are concerned about it . #% That is my interpretation of what you have said , Commissioner . #% But let me ask you what exactly is the situation ? #% I strongly support the notion that citizens who wish to take up temporary residency outside their home country should be allowed to bring their personal motor vehicle without running into financial and administrative obstacles . #% That should have been the line to take : if they are dangerous then they should be banned , rather than saying ` they may cause problems ' . #% Mr President , if you watch the language groups that are participating in this debate you will see that there is a lot of pressure in the north-west of the Community on the fishing industry and deep concern , which is reflected here . #% Can I also ask his view in relation to this being an issue best applied by Member States ? #% People who have allergies look at the list . #% While , as a Socialist , I believe that guerrillaism under the conditions in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution , the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military repression . #% Doha was oversold for its potential for lifting the poor out of poverty . #% Mr President , organic food production is becoming increasingly important in my constituency in Ireland . #% The Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party believes that there is a credibility gap at the heart of Union economic policy , which is undermining public confidence in the entire enterprise . #% I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues , the Belgian Presidency , the Commission and others , because , while America has been looking in another direction , we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions , a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace . #% The fact that I did not comment on what the Swedish Prime Minister said does not mean that I agree with what he said . #% This presents us with certain opportunities to pursue the line suggested by the honourable Member . #% We have the technology , the know-how and the resources to ensure that these things do not happen . #% Perhaps it is a kind of progress that they agree on 19th century absolute sovereignty , although it is unfortunate that they continue to fall out over the outcome of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 ! #% The provisional IRA has instilled fear into people . #% 
It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes . #% That is part of what is wrong with our transport system . #% A government has been formed and the transfer of powers and devolution is only hours away . #% In areas such as Ireland farming incomes have been decimated through no fault of the farmers concerned . #% We should ensure that it is in step with scientific best practice in this area , with minimum red tape , that it is SME - and consumer-friendly and , most importantly , that it does what it says on the tin , i.e. it becomes a tool to help combat obesity and other chronic diseases . #% The criminal fraternity throughout the European Union has enormous resources - resources unimaginable even to the European Union budget . #% I especially want to thank the staff of our own Committee on Budgetary Control who were most diligent and expert and generous with their time , despite being moved around a lot recently , which is not very helpful . #% However , I support the remaining provisions of what is already an emaciated directive . #% I would like the Commissioner herself to state what exactly she did or did not say . #% EU Enlargement is a win-win situation for the European Union and for the people of the applicant states . #% If you are looking for the respect and the hearts of the people of Europe , and particularly the young people , why do you not start by reversing the 10 % decrease that the Council of Ministers have proposed in the development cooperation budget ? #% The ELDR believes that the Union and the international community must maintain pressure on Mr Milosevic and must be prepared , if necessary , to back this with the credible certainty of military intervention . #% I am very pleased that she realises , as we all do , the added European value of telecommunications for all of the Lisbon agenda . #% The convention should not be seen as giving a green light to the nuclear industry for such trafficking of deadly material . #% Could we have a guarantee from the President-in-Office that , whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1 % , they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being ? #% I hope , therefore , that they are quite clear we will not accept something which cuts the Fifth Framework Programme in real terms in comparison with the Fourth . #% In particular , lifelong learning is becoming more important to people 's everyday lives , whether as regards access to opportunities to employment , or in using ATM machines to get cash , or having to go on-line to get banking and other services because local public services are being closed down in an era of competition and liberalisation . #% I thank him for his efforts in this respect . #% I also agree that the legal basis is clearer under Art. 175 ( 1 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and support the rapporteur . #% I agree with Mr Van Orden . #% The cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective . #% There are areas that are open to improvement . #% In other situations , I see the failure to pay levies whereby the national government , again , picks up the bill . #% Industry needs to be allowed to place on the market equine veterinary products that do not have MRLs , to be used according to the cascade principle , with a record of treatment and exclusion from the food chain . #% The main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ? #% Yesterday evening after the votes in the Chamber , a comment was made which I would like to distance myself from and not to be associated with . #% This is the current situation and has proved reliable in terms of protecting public health . #% But the question here is how can this actually be ensured ? #% On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings . #% I voted against Prodi basically because he is a complete federalist and also in favour of the militarising of the EU which I do not approve of . #% Morocco is the first , but there are more to come . #% On the contrary , I believe that this differential treatment should be a spur to the Council to renegotiate our cooperation agreement with ASEAN . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for her very full reply . #% This is a European matter . #% Of course , in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and , unlike national budgets , it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union . #% Europe is suffering from a credibility problem and to deal with it we urgently need to evolve from rule makers to economic performers . #% In relation to the UN review on the programme of action coming up in July 2003 , we also need to look at things that remain to be done . #% The unemployment rate in the European Union is twice the level of the United States and three times that of Japan . #% Therefore , any mechanism that helps to protect these businesses from the added costs and financial implications surrounding late payment should be welcomed . #% I also call on the Commission , as guardian of the Treaties , to ensure that the requirement for unanimity is upheld . #% The time has come for the implementation of a positive renewable energy programme , rather than continuing debates , both within governments of Member States and here in this Parliament . #% I welcome the issues highlighted by Mr Busk and Mrs Attwooll in their respective reports . #% We are conscious of the damage inflicted on our society by alcohol abuse and the social costs that this entails . #% The Greens have tabled a series of amendments with a view to converting the money spent on fusion to promoting sustainable and renewable energies . #% You will recall that fisheries control is the responsibility of the Member States , not the Commission . #% Failure to reach a final agreement on the controversial Constitution will not mean failure for the Irish presidency -- unless of course the government is foolish enough to give the impression that such an agreement could somehow be reached . #% Mr President , I wish to ask you to raise urgently with the United Kingdom Government the issue of its failure to properly and fully carry out its obligations under the Euratom Treaty and European directives on nuclear safety . #% Do you know the numbers of Community citizens travelling outside the Community as against the number of Community citizens travelling within the Community on a regular basis ? #% This integrated two-pronged approach , which marries environmental and economic concerns , is a positive departure . #% Competition must not just be free : it must also be fair , and it seems to me that principle is being swept aside . #% For instance , the US , Canada , Australia and New Zealand have all implemented major legislation to progress integrated management of coastal and marine areas . #% Mr Crowley welcomed the report . #% The body is no longer balanced and is now discriminating against the unionist community . #% It is only right and proper where there is a system of wholesale freedom of movement of persons and cross-border traffic that a streamlined and structured procedure is in operation so that recourse is available to injured parties in the case of accidents . #% The case of the young British au pair who was found guilty in the United States of fatally injuring a child in her care has raised other concerns . #% This is more than a missed opportunity . #% No matter how good our tax regimes or infrastructure , if we do not have the brains , intelligence and capacity to utilise and exploit those ideas , then we will fail . #% I now enter the world of science fiction and explain that to be energy-efficient , computers must go to sleep , but they must wake up instantly when they are required to do so . #% In December 2002 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was a great success and , amongst other things , it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied . #% The most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation . #% in writing . - As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and a committed environmental campaigner , I expected a Dess report which would represent a CAP for the carbon era - one based upon environmental incentives , resource management , and a strong investment in the wider environmental issues facing the EU . #% I am glad , but slightly concerned , that they were unanimous because they might not be taking seriously what is being required of them . #% Most Iraqis do not see the Council as being responsible for the country 's administration and continue to blame the coalition for the many hardships they endure . #% On the other hand , the United States Government has accepted a request from its textile industry to investigate the sharp increase in the import of textiles from China . #% We also continue to have a serious problem for abductions outside the Community . #% in writing . - MEP Schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety through the introduction of increased safety measures requirements for car manufacturers . #% 
Multilateral environment agreements can not be discarded in the name of free trade and the precautionary principle must be explicitly included in WTO rules . #% I would ask the Commission and the Council to listen to this united voice and to adopt ` European Food Safety Authority ' as the title of the institution . #% Sound economics , realism and results are what citizens are demanding and what are needed to continue to build the European project . #% Mr President , this is a very important report because the European Community is discussing recovery plans for fish stocks for the first time . #% I am supporting this Conciliation Agreement , which guarantees that the elimination of hazardous substances will now feature in this Directive and addresses this imbalance . #% I would ask Members to be particularly careful not to undermine the confidence of Europe 's electorate by going over the top about scandals . #% It will speed up the process of getting rid of this unsatisfactory situation . #% Mr President , my Group very much welcomes this report . #% We would indicate that we want them to join as soon as possible and as soon as they fulfil the necessary conditions . #% We , in this House , should not accept that there is any doubt about EMU . #% Over the next six months the Belgian presidency will have a coordinating role as we put in place the finishing touches to the launch of the euro notes and coins on 1 January next . #% Commissioner , if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives , including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear . #% This should be protected and maintained at all times . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Pérez Royo for his report and the efficient conduct of business in committee . #% It should also help local and regional authorities to develop networks to cooperate in the field of cultural tourism . #% Commissioner Fischler told us we had no co-responsibility , but that our views would be taken into consideration . #% This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses . #% Consumers should be free to choose their own level of potency and nutrients , provided that they are safe and appropriately labelled . #% In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events , but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties . #% We have good postal services accompanied by a quality social service which is of immense value . #% What I am about to do is to read the wise wisdom of all his words that he has thought out and put on paper . #% We need to ensure that this is not the case . #% As a Member of the European Parliament for the West and North-West of Ireland , I represent a predominantly rural constituency . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming some of the conclusions of the European Council , but I would also like to caution or criticise others . #% Again , we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget . #% I think the example of UNICEF is a good place to start in understanding the desperate and urgent need to reform the UN . #% I ask you to do whatever you can , in your last days in office , to ensure that this issue is given a higher priority in the progress towards accession . #% The European Treaties have espoused a need for the freedom of movement of goods , persons and services within the territories of the European Union . #% So what should we do in the EU ? #% If this happens in future , I would like Parliament to request that this masthead be removed from this magazine . #% Employees will be protected from predatory funds bent on short-term profiteering through the destruction of viable companies . #% We discussed it in the group and with other groups in this Parliament and passed a motion for a resolution on the plight of Amina Lawal . #% The outbreak of FMD in the European Union in 2001 was a disaster not only for agriculture but also for many related enterprises and organisations . #% Decommissioning of nuclear power stations is not research . #% I do not have the time to concentrate on the need for ongoing research in the food sector and the potential of new technology in improving product diversification , quality and consumer satisfaction . #% Would the Commissioner agree with this particular statement ? #% At present , many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU/IMF programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks - both Irish and European - and the government . #% Fishing is very different from other occupations . #% Our refusal to do this , even at the height of the bombing in January , indicated that we prefer the status quo of business as usual , with our contribution of humanitarian aid possibly being a salve to our conscience . #% This was a specific case not a general ruling . #% However , the aid sent from the European Union and other donor countries is a mere token , given the scale of the destruction and suffering , and particularly in view of a statistic mentioned by Mr Howitt : almost half a million people have lost their homes and their belongings . #% It also raises questions for the transport of nuclear material such as MOX fuel and , indeed , for nuclear safeguards because of the production of plutonium stockpiles . #% It is a first step in a good direction for the legislative process that will hopefully be completed in the not too distant future . #% Legislation to take this on board is vital in Member States . #% If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future . #% I am fundamentally opposed to any kind of European army or European police force or to a European defence identity within the EU . #% This model effectively separates ownership interests from planning decisions , which helps overall efficiency . #% If we are intent on imposing further layers of procedure , if we insist on a whole range of modifications to animal transport , we will stretch the system to breaking point in terms of increased costs and reduced efficiency . #% We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September , a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore . #% This is absolute nonsense . #% This can be a help , but on its own is no panacea for all the problems facing the rural dweller . #% Unfortunately , that has not yet been agreed , but we would ask the Commission to proceed in this direction . #% I note the firm stand taken on several occasions by the President of the Republic of Lithuania , Dalia Grybauskaitė , denouncing draft homophobic legislation as being harmful for Lithuanian citizens and the image of Lithuania , and encourage the President to veto the amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences should they be approved . #% Let me also remind him that when his party leader , Mr Hague , was Secretary of State for Wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements . #% As I travel to Montreal next month as part of the European delegation , I look forward to seeing the global players face the reality of this year and work together as partners in tackling this extremely important global problem . #% If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms , then the cost of these medicines will be substantially reduced . #% One seeks to limit organic seeds to less than 0.1 % GMO contamination , adding another safeguard to the original regulation which only specifies that the parent plant , not the seed , should have been produced organically . #% Whether a child is raised within or without a family , both circumstances will have a profound effect upon that child ' s social development . #% I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week . #% We can not afford further risk to the industry . #% This House will no longer be the junior partner . #% The overall objective of any development policy must be to strive to build and strengthen democracy and the rule of law , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% It is about their way of life , the only one possible in many areas . #% As Mrs Corbey rightly points out in her report -- and I thank her for her work -- it is only fair and equitable that the same approach be taken with regard to our colleagues in the new Member States , as was indicted to them during the accession negotiations . #% This would offer welcome assistance in their current plight . #% While that persists , we will persist with our call for the appointment of our own prosecutor , who can look after our own resources and be seen to do that . #% 
I certainly welcome the active role the High Representative of the EU for the common foreign and security policy is playing in the Middle East . #% For me , however , it is a question of injured people and their families . #% Those who take pleasure in pointing out that agriculture takes up almost 50 % of the budget should keep in mind that this general support is as much a subsidy to consumers as it is support for the farming community - the people who are expected to guarantee food supply and quality and at the same time maintain the rural environment . #% As far as my own group is concerned , we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage . #% I do not want to go into the details of her continued detention . #% It means that men and the policy-makers are going to have to look at the way society is structured . #% Since then there has been a change of government in 1996 and the decision was taken to suspend the application and to look instead for a strengthened association agreement . #% I say that with deep regret . #% More civilians have died in Darfur than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined . #% There are , however , serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999 , when it was agreed that Member States ` determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty ' , but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices . #% On this occasion , I have been contacted by farming organisations , veterinary groups , agricultural co-operatives , pharmaceutical interests , health stores and numerous individual constituents . #% We have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living . #% As this was clearly inaccurate , according to the regulator 's report , this independent verification now lacks credibility . #% I did miss a vote during the week because of the lifts , but I recognise that in due course these matters will be resolved . #% That is why the debate has been so robust and why all groups have had Members working on this directive almost full time in recent months . #% Following on from a number of scares in recent years , tremendous steps have been taken to fine-tune the whole food production process so that nothing can be left to chance and so that our consumers can have peace of mind . #% Following on from that , could I urge firstly the President-in-Office to use his good offices and his benign influence on his colleagues within the Council to ensure that there is a strong European Union voice and presence at the United Nations Convention on Disability ? #% She did not say what it was , but she certainly signalled that it was going to go in during the debate yesterday . #% They are a group of people who want to start a co-op to produce Fair Trade coffee . #% People in Europe are involved in scams and bogus companies that are lending and giving money to Africa and they have to be stopped . #% That is irrational behaviour . #% In conclusion , the Commission and Parliament must ensure that tough decisions are worked through in a spirit of understanding and common purpose . #% She also failed to deal with issues such as coherency with development issues and the very strong trade complex that we had . #% There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously . #% The devil will be in the detail , of course , and we still have a long way to go to agree a new round of regional aid programmes . #% So it is very timely that we should now lay down a marker in this Parliament , because there is no point in doing this in November , or indeed December , when everybody will be aware of the very serious situation . #% Mr President , I should like to begin with the disturbing problem of the lack of consensus which has re-emerged on the question of fiscal policy at the heart of the EMU debate . #% The list is very long . #% For many years the FAO has been warning of the problems , yet we keep looking for fish somewhere else until there is nowhere else . #% Mr President , firstly , may I congratulate the rapporteur . #% I apologise for being a member of a Conference of Presidents which may have put you in the embarrassing position of thinking you would not have to come to the Chamber . #% If you get a proper request for an official delegation , can you assure us that you will assent to such a request in view of the particular concerns of Members of this Parliament on humanitarian grounds ? #% Politically it was not very popular in the past but the fishing communities throughout the European Union are beginning to recognize that there are possibilities and that it can be achieved without damage to our environment and it can help to save coastal communities . #% All our countries need the Hague Convention . #% Does the presidency agree that it would be wise to set aside some resources under a special Community initiative for unexpected crises to enable the Union to act in such situations ? #% Again , Goldstone is clear : these detentions of PLC members are contrary to international law . #% It appears to me that the Dalai Lama , and indeed His Excellency the Chinese Ambassador , are singing from the same hymn sheet on this and I would urge them to make progress . #% in writing . - ECR Group MEPs supported this report as we believed that the legal basis of this legislation should be changed from ` Article 31 EAEC ' to ` Article 168 TFEU ' . #% As we stand on the threshold of launching this irreversible project , it is important to take stock of some of the unresolved issues . #% Can she say to what extent discussions have taken place with the Irish Government on the possibility of sub-dividing Ireland into a number of regions in the context of the regional policy programme expected to follow the present one which finishes in 1999 ? #% Mr President , this Parliament gave its views clearly during the reading on the Sixth Framework Programmes . #% Shop shelves are full of low value , perishable goods that have been transported tens of thousands of miles to satisfy consumer pricing expectations . #% There are so many issues before us . #% Let me outline the contribution I believe it can make . #% Last weekend 's political sparring and lack of conclusion to the summit was not worthy either of you , Mr Blair , nor of Mr Chirac . #% It was right to impose sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Iraq ' s expulsion from Kuwait , but it is certainly not right to continue them in their present form . #% ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 . #% The most effective way is by guaranteeing proper wages and ensuring that people can maintain as much of their own earning potential as possible to reduce labour taxes . #% However , the proposal to establish a single budget line could simplify the work of the European Parliament as a whole and increase transparency . #% Mr President , rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler . #% The emergency regulations prevent him from leaving the country for six months or from being in contact with any foreign person -- even by email or phone -- otherwise he will be rearrested . #% Can I ask Mr Prodi whether in principle , subject to Parliament and the Commission being able to formalise appropriate arrangements , it would be possible to do this regularly ? #% There are essentially two tasks for national and European authorities : they have to oversee the successful changeover to the euro and provide the public with information about it . #% What is that saying about French beef production and protectionism ? #% Mr President , we are standing on the threshold of a truly historic European Council where we expect the final political decision will be taken to give the green light to ten applicant countries to become full Member States in 2004 . #% Mr President , thank you for allowing my question and thanks to the President-in-Office for his answer , even though he has stated that it is a non-answer . #% I am appealing to you on behalf of the people who are trying to produce the food . #% Secondly , politically , we strongly welcome the green light which was given this week to Cyprus as part of that process . #% The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations . #% Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts . #% This has a very negative effect on the economy of future fisheries and on the health of marine ecosystems . #% He was a fearless journalist who over many years tirelessly illuminated that twilight world where gangsters and political terrorism and political extremism intersect . #% The current situation in the wake of 11 September underlines this point . #% The ultimate goal of Union sought by the overwhelming majority of Member States can not be held to ransom indefinitely . #% There has to be two sides , Unita and MPLA , implementing the Lusaka Accords to have a solution in Angola and the tension in the region . #% We also need to recognise that sovereign states have their role to play in that they control their national police forces and security services . #% 
Secondly , there can not be a reform of the EU Structural Fund programmes unless there is a continued commitment to financially supporting the four Cohesion Fund countries . #% in writing . - Cultural and creative industries are not only a source of wealth and employment but also contribute to Europe 's social and cultural fabric . #% We have come a long way towards achieving this . #% We should respect the undisputed scientific consensus that fishmeal poses no risk of TSE . #% How then will we feed the people of Europe ? #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Banotti for raising this very important issue in the House . #% Such deaths devastate families and tear the heart out of communities . #% Straight in front of me I can see at least four people , just in this row here , who are Group staff - not Members . #% The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism , their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse . #% It is deeply regrettable that for many transport users in Ireland , as I am sure in other Member States , this is a measure that has simply come too late . #% There is little point in sending Members of Parliament half way across the globe , to be part of a Commission/Council/Parliament delegation , a Community delegation , if one third are kept outside the door albeit with briefings when the business is done . #% McKenna report ( A4-3 / 99 ) : #% Since we are discussing the budget and our contribution , we have to look into our souls , and I very much hope that the Commissioner will give us an adequate response to the concerns I am expressing about this issue . #% I refer in particular to the Erasmus programme which dealt mainly with third-level student exchanges . #% Given the coincidence of each Member State 's separate and collective interests and the role of the Commission in the domain of international trade , this is classically the type of legislation that is more suited to the European Union than a multiplicity of bilateral Member State arrangements . #% We congratulate Mr Böge on his report and we are happy with its broad thrust . #% Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices . #% The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about . #% Decoupling waste from our growing economies is vital . #% I should like to compliment Mr Cabrol on his detailed and excellent report . #% The House has been divided and different groups have had the opportunity to put on the record their preferred optimum solution amongst the options available . #% Without people , we have very little else . #% Not only are we unwilling to risk upsetting a good business market for the sake of bringing injustice in Gaza to an end , but we are also unwilling so far to dissolve or even just suspend the EU-Israel agreement . #% It is not an inspiring example of responsibility in action . #% Mr President , we have come to depend in the 21st century on what we call a knowledge based economy and the information society . #% My group , through this House , will work with other parliamentarians and with the Commission to try to convince the incoming Portuguese Presidency to be more ambitious in the reform , all the while respecting the timetable . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado and Mr Tsatsos for the report they have presented to us today . #% They have now gone one step further and developed the first degree programme via the Internet which is a BSc in Rural Development . #% We were well placed in having a large parliamentary delegation . #% At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century . #% You lost . #% The slowness of payments is no longer tolerable in an age when we can boast of nanosecond technology . #% There are many things that need to be attended to . #% While we all condemn this , we have stood by and watched his henchmen murder innocent white farmers and be rewarded by the President for their actions . #% A critically important aspect of the launch of the new currency will be the attitude of individual citizens to the euro . #% As regards correct identification , a microchip would be very useful in tracing the animal 's place of origin . #% To this end , I am calling on the Government to launch a full parliamentary inquiry in the Dáil immediately into the use of Irish territory as part of the CIA rendition circuit . #% We have proved we can farm salmon and shellfish to the highest standards , taking all the necessary precautions to ensure good environmental practices . #% It comprises three funds , for Nature , Environment and Third Countries . #% Indeed , the RUC has more or less admitted so much by asking British and American police officials to supervise the investigation . #% In what way , then , will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market ? #% Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that , unfortunately , such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States . #% We believe that he has represented Parliament at European Councils and throughout the regions of this Union with authority and with distinction . #% The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed . #% This report will enhance our role as legislators . #% It is estimated that something like 400 000 people in Europe have this condition . #% Mr President , I fully support legislation to upgrade the quality and standard of telecommunication infrastructures within the European Union . #% As far as the Lisbon agenda is concerned , I say to our Taoiseach that we have failed yet again to deliver progress on our much-quoted ambition for the EU to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 . #% To conclude , Europe has a role to play in promoting health . #% My group believes that to do this the presidency must develop proposals to ensure that the European Central Bank , together with the Euro 11 Council , assisted by the Commission and accountable to this Parliament , fully develops the external representation of the euro . #% The non-agricultural industrial market access negotiations must deliver tariff reductions for all products . #% A Zambian Government official described to me the difficulty Zambia has in retaining doctors . #% The enlargement process provides the basis for a truly historic reconciliation on a continent which has been divided over the past century by wars and ideologies . #% Firstly , Mr President , I should like to congratulate you on your election and wish you every success during your term of office . #% There is a definition which excludes the use of municipal waste , gives permission for successful support mechanisms to continue and thereby boosts investor confidence . #% Without designated , ring-fenced funding specifically earmarked for the environment , we will not achieve our environmental policy objectives . #% This is a lesson in how not to resolve conflict within the EU . #% To come back to the issue of dumping vessels discarded within the European Union on other countries , we have to be very careful that we are not dumping unsafe and ecologically unsound vessels on countries at cheap prices . #% The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection , which would warrant an environment base -- an approach of minimum harmonisation . #% The response of the Commission is not what Parliament demanded ; we asked you to submit proposals to the European Parliament but your response has been to expand your previous committee . #% We wish him a fair wind only as regards that particular issue . #% I am disappointed that many conservative MEPs stood with big business interests on this issue . #% I am particularly anxious to hear an answer concerning the initiatives they hope to undertake during the Danish presidency . #% These have not been accepted by the Council . #% A major part of this work will be ensuring greater economic policy coordination between all 15 Member States . #% Thank you for your response , President-in-Office . #% 
I deem this to be very serious and would ask Members to consider the fact that , while many might not fully understand the science of this , if we do not accept the Socialist amendment and accept the PPE amendment , it means that we are going against the advice of scientists and are creating two total allowable catch areas within a single stock . #% Although radiological diagnosis provides undoubted benefits for patients , it entails risks , and for this reason we have to try to reduce the use of medical radiation where at all possible by employing alternative methods . #% Since the fall of the Taliban , drug production has increased tenfold , bringing misery and addiction to many and huge profits for the pushers . #% We need credibility , in practice as well as in theory . #% One of the biggest costs confronting small and medium-sized business , where the bulk of today 's jobs are to be found , is the cost of servicing the capital which is being borrowed to fund such things as product development or property and equipment purchases . #% Ireland is a success story , as we know , in this respect , with an economy which is performing well . #% The good news is that it used to be 34 000 . #% This tax has made cars unnecessarily expensive in Ireland . #% People are saying that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away . #% It is about time the EU owned up to its responsibility and made it impossible for light arms to be traded like this , causing the death and destruction of many innocent people . #% -- Mr President , recital A of our resolution says that the people of Burma are subject to human rights abuses including forced labour , persecution of dissidents , conscription of child soldiers , rape and pillage by government troops and forced relocation . #% Mr President , we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive . #% We must all be on the watch for that . #% I know that the Swedish Presidency wants to change that and involve citizens more extensively and be more transparent . #% For example , Ireland and Britain have common law systems in operation , but many other European Union states have a civil law structure . #% It has been very hard to have a reasonable rational debate on the impact of an outbreak of BSE , be it 3 , 4 or several hundred cases at a time . #% I continue to express my concerns that this EU directive should not undermine the competitiveness and innovation of our brightest and best companies in Europe , in particular by putting EU business and industry at a disadvantage in the global marketplace . #% It has never been allowed before , and it would certainly mean the end of the Irish sugar industry . #% At a time when the European Union is expanding to include ten new countries and when these countries are making stringent efforts to encourage economic growth , we have a duty at least to give these countries access to resources , which the existing fifteen have had access to in the past . #% Northern Ireland fishermen have made great sacrifices in the past but they are now being convinced that the knife has been turned on them . #% In 1991 the Council banned the use of driftnets longer than 2.5 kilometres in all regions except the Baltic Sea . #% Another key issue is the Lisbon process . #% Hard cases make bad law . #% In fact , they flout numerous examples of EU legislation , such as the 1984 Directive on Misleading Advertising . #% The House will recall the positive opinion on the substance of the measures and resolution of 25 October 1996 , the Gallagher report , and its opinion of 26 April 1998 on the implementation of technical measures in the common fisheries policy . #% Secondly , while the 10 % increase in complaints to the Ombudsman is not to be welcomed , we should recognise and interpret these figures within the context of the efforts that the office has made to increase its profile . #% Let us stop young people choosing to do other things . #% I beg the indulgence of yourself and the House to ask you , Madam President , on behalf of this Parliament , to express our outrage at the capitulation by the British Government , the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the security forces in Northern Ireland in the face of Orange Order mob rule ; also to express our outrage at the first bombing to take place in Northern Ireland in the last two years , which took place at the weekend . #% The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expeditious solution to this problem . #% I come from an island nation with a high dependence on air transport and improved efficiency in these transport models is extremely important to enable future economic development to take place in my country . #% I object strongly , as I am sure do many Irish people and colleagues here , to Ireland initiating diplomatic relations with a military dictatorship that controls the Burmese against the will of its people . #% As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , I would like to take this opportunity of restating that the result of the Nice Treaty referendum in Ireland should not be interpreted or construed as a vote against the enlargement of the European Union . #% I know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime . #% I am a friend of Islam and I think we should stop , in this European Union and the European Parliament , demonising the Arabs and demonising Islam . #% That also appears to be the view of the EU justice ministers , who are meeting today to put in place enhanced EU programmes to better coordinate EU asylum policies . #% . I should just like to respond very briefly to Mr Pannella . #% I should have had a reply on 25 April but still have not received one . #% Significant environmental pollution of air and water and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have become characteristic of the early stages of developing industrial economies , as they were once with us . #% The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns , but it does ask the hard questions , and rightly so , if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues , such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom ; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane , degrading treatment and internment without trial ; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps ; forced compliance with family planning policy ; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners . #% Consultation between the groups , in particular the shadow rapporteurs , has been constructive and positive and I wish to thank my colleagues in other groups for that process . #% Mr President , I am sure that you are going to mention it and I am sure colleagues will share our joy in Ireland at the ratification of both our referenda . #% It is important to substantiate this and it is important to note that for a number of years the economic growth in my country has been between 10 and 12 % - in sharp contrast with the late 1980s when it was 0 % . #% I do so because I am aware that despite the personal tragedies she has experienced at the hands of the LTTE , she courageously initiated moves which paved the way for the current peace initiative . #% Something has to be done . #% As a representative of the East coast of Ireland , I have always resented the Irish Sea being used as a rubbish tip for the activities of British Nuclear Fuels . #% The great danger now is that the further we get away from the terrible events of 30 January , the more likely that this -- like so many other murders of innocent people in Northern Ireland over the last 35 years -- will go unsolved and will be forgotten about . #% The report which is coming before STOA this week makes for worrying reading . #% The EU , the said , is the wrong institutional platform from which to deal with globalisation . #% There is the will to grasp the opportunity to have a treaty , to be called , I suppose , EURENEW . #% in writing . - Whilst I support the rights of pregnant women , I can not , in this current economic climate , support this report . #% Because of the way the world is changing , globalisation is unstoppable unless , of course , we erect iron curtains or bamboo curtains , and those too would be blown away by the winds of change . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and to pay tribute to him and to Mr Castagnetti for their initiative on this proposal for the promotion of European pathways for work-linked training including apprenticeship . #% Finally , to ensure that doctors in the Member States understand what these cards mean , a training or advertising programme should be put in place . #% I believe you have succeeded in restoring an effective and substantial working relationship which is so necessary at the heart of a proper functioning Community method . #% Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission . #% Sometimes we get it wrong as legislators and I think Equitable Life might yet prove that . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bauer for her hard work . #% In other words , as the European Environment Agency has told us , we need consistency and transparency in reporting on greenhouse gas emissions . #% I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market . #% Our position is very clear . #% Thus local employers , employees and , ultimately , local consumers , would be the losers . #% We must devise measures to minimise the effects of the increase of variable costs that results from high fuel prices . #% New research in this area will contribute significantly to its future development . #% Already , within the European Union , Member States have ratified and transposed into their legal systems the European Convention on Human Rights , which , although the document is nearly 50 years old , has shown itself capable of evolving in line with changing conditions as well as developing new rights . #% I would like to thank her for her particular contribution . #% It is therefore logical and beneficial to establish recognition of training given in third countries . #% 
Certainly this is something which we as a presidency will try to advance as best we can during our six months in office . #% It is very clear that there is a strong move to reduce farm prices to world price levels and the levels of Eastern Europe to save money . #% I hope that such a pact will reassure those who are concerned about the effects of a single currency on their jobs and businesses and on their savings . #% Finally , it is my personal hope that while I support this derogation , I hope that it would in no way hinder the much-needed upgrading and extension of the Irish rail system . #% In this House on Tuesday , I listened carefully to one speaker after another talking about ` respecting the dignity of difference , respecting the right of Members to hold different opinions and showing tolerance to those opinions ' . #% I welcome the fact that the threshold is to be increased . #% There seems to be a view that , by asking for the truth to be established , we are in some way taking sides against the Uzbek authorities . #% This was observed by the radiological protection institute in Ireland in 1994 , exactly one year after the British granted BNFL the licence , which is responsible for the environmental mess that we now have on our hands . #% A very big multinational company - Fruit of the Loom - is pulling out of a labour-intensive industry with thousands of jobs because they want to get the product manufactured in Morocco . #% Mr President , it will come as no surprise that my main plea today is for the Council to make the effort to meet its timetable to enable Parliament to fully exercise its democratic mandate and add democratic legitimacy . #% Has the Commission received from any Member States ' customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement ? #% One of my concerns is not actually about this year or next year but about the new programme which starts in the year 2000 . #% Inshore fishery activities essentially maintain the social fabric of those communities . #% In essence , dual pricing campaigns across Europe in all key supermarkets and shopping outlets must now begin . #% For any European strategy in this area to work , it is crucial that the various countries give priority to drawing up national action plans . #% Has the Court of Auditors any recommendations to make to the European Parliament concerning the procedures to be followed in awarding any future contracts , taking into account the experience over the last few years on this particular building ? #% This policy is doing the image of the Union no good either with its own producers or abroad . #% In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials . #% We have had situations where , because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples , people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant . #% One of the things that the sites constantly emphasise is education - the education of young people . #% The third countries simply do not have the resources to ensure that the vessels from the EU and other distant water fleets respect the rules . #% Hence the conciliation procedure which you , Mr President , were involved in . #% So , there was a problem . #% If Yahoo and Google can censor the web to suit a totalitarian Chinese Government , they can certainly censor the web for the benefit of our children . #% There are other aspects of the legislation which are also extremely disturbing . #% So , Commissioner McCreevy had the right to express his opinion . #% Mr President , I welcome much of what is in the report , particularly the need for transparency , the issue dealing with the end use of weapons and the illegal trade in arms . #% I am afraid I do not accept the logic of this wholly . #% This matter of the eggs is one of hygiene and is not a consumer issue . #% This reserve accumulates resources across a number of budget categories . #% I am sure that implication was not intended . #% With improving job opportunities outside agriculture I am worried about the continuity of family farming . #% I would like to seek clarification on aspects of the statement . #% The ECJ ruled that this provision provided too little in the way of additional health protection to justify the serious impact on the interests of the manufacturers . #% I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative . #% However , I do believe that EU Governments have been very pro-active with regard to implementing broad information campaigns concerning the forthcoming practical changes . #% I am thinking , in particular , of the tourist industry in Ireland , which is worth EUR 4 billion . #% I do not like dealing with so serious an issue through the back door . #% That is why the Walter report is such an excellent one , because it puts forward constructive policies on how we can help those countries move into EMU and into the third phase faster . #% Now is the time to set out a comprehensive strategy to address the situation in relation to the future . #% The Liberal Group will support the core of this proposal because it is the real issue . #% In conclusion , while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER + , I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme . #% With regard to energy efficiency , it is absolutely regrettable that the Council has not supported Parliament and the Commission on the SAVE II programme and that the Council has not adopted energy-efficient measures in the energy sector . #% There is no doubt that we need interoperability between our air traffic control systems ; we need better integration and better and more common equipment and training of staff . #% The proposed ban would apply only to products tested in the EU and would allow companies to export testing to other parts of the world . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the Commissioner and , in particular , the rapporteur for his work on this issue . #% The tóraidhe were Anglo-Irish people who were expelled from their land on account of their religion . #% We need to ensure that health and safety regulations are strictly enforced . #% They have hijacked the EU institutions and this will mean that some states become second class members including the new applicant countries . #% Mr President , the WTO negotiations on agriculture , combined with the Commission 's proposals for CAP reform , represent fundamental change for European agriculture and the welfare of farm families . #% They collapse and people lose jobs and our social security bill increases . #% I regret that the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy did not draw up an opinion on Mr Katiforis ' s report - it should have done . #% Enlargement can go ahead , but we want it to be fair and equitable . #% The European Union with its internal market and free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is a positive economic prospect for a country which is seeking to find more markets for its domestic manufactured goods . #% We need to redress the balance between economic policies and social policies by providing for a social audit of all European Union policies . #% The letter is signed by my colleague Professor Trakatellis and me . #% It is important that we remember that the people in the European Union are entitled to have proper representation in relation to their concerns . #% The political zealots in the Commission and in the Council , who support the abolition of duty-free , tell us that the continuation of duty-free is inconsistent with the single market . #% Only when real engagement and dialogue takes place with Russia can we guarantee a relationship of equality between the EU and Russia , despite our dependence on Russia for energy , despite Russia 's dependence on us for markets , and despite the interaction that there is in geopolitical terms between eastern Europe and Russia . #% I wish to ask the Commission : is it prepared to use Article 100a to set a consistent set of emissionsrelated targets , which are non-optional , to set within that a menu of tax options available to states to be chosen through subsidiarity , consistent with the integrity of the internal market and , in that way , to actually find a policy mechanism to promote what we all say we want based on a recognition that the current procedure of always falling back on Article 99 leaves us adrift ? #% In the twenty-five dark years of violence in Northern Ireland I would remind you that there was never an assault on , or the murder of , a journalist . #% No matter how you try and come up with solutions to deal with the problems that are there , the one thing we should learn from the practical experience we now have of a number of these various social models is that one size does not fit all . #% On the regulation on certain fluorinated gases , there has been serious debate over the legal base : whether the legal base of the regulation should be the environment ( Article 175 of the Treaty ) or the single market ( Article 95 of the Treaty ) or whether the dual legal base proposed in the common position ( Articles 175 and 95 ) should be maintained . #% I support adoption of the Buzek report , which will enable the common position compromise agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to put in place and implement the Seventh Framework Programme , despite my disappointment that the budget allocated to research and technological development has been reduced . #% The euro , the capital markets , the consumer and EMU #% Not only do we lack scientific rigour in our approach , but we are possibly going to come into conflict with the WTO . #% 
So I think we make too much of that issue . #% Of course the consumer is always right , but on this occasion the European Union legislators have had to redouble their efforts to improve the safety of the food chain in Europe and to restore consumer confidence in food products within the Union . #% However , in many of the villages around the cities of my constituency , houses are being thrown up with no thought for utilities , for enough water or sewage , or for the important elements of social infrastructure . #% Mr President , you will recall that since Christmas this House has taken a special interest in the case of Roisín McAliskey who was incarcerated in Holloway Prison in England . #% This is the only way to ensure that the fulfilment of basic human rights becomes an indispensable aspect of our cooperation , not only with the Republic of Vietnam but with all the countries of the region . #% Thank you for the progress on consultation you have made to date . #% Nobody can be allowed to pollute our groundwater or freshwater with nitrates or anything else . #% At the end of the day we should avoid complications that bring no tangible benefit to our consumers and only give ammunition to those who argue that the EU creates burdensome over-regulation . #% I have spoken about employment and entrepreneurship and social justice . #% I understand , and I would like it confirmed , that the proposers -- the Australians -- have now withdrawn the proposal for a zero quota . #% Mr President , while welcoming the programme presented to us today I must express some alarm that on page 12 , under ` Key initiatives - sustainable and inclusive economy ' , the mountain has laboured and made a promise to produce a green paper on public services or services of economic interest . #% He goes on to say that our defence industry is already at a serious competitive disadvantage , but the time has come for that industry to realise that it should move away from producing weapons that cause havoc around the world and start to produce something that will contribute to the betterment of society rather than to its destruction . #% In some cases , detainees ' family members have been arrested merely because of their connection to the accused . #% This has not been the approach nor the view of my group . #% This would serve a very positive function for all farmers in receipt of CAP payments in future . #% We are here not to hold on to one ideological viewpoint , but to give what we consider to be a fair , honest and truthful account of what is contained within the text of the Treaty . #% Let us urgently concentrate on the substantial risk of PAHs from sources such as incinerators , especially when those incinerators will burn tyres containing PAHs . #% Negotiations have been going on ; letters have been going backwards and forwards but nothing has actually happened . #% That is something we need to address . #% The success of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is beginning to create a cultural shift away from traditional litigation . #% I will not attempt to outline my objection to the CAP reform proposals in today 's budget debate , but I wish to make one very short and simple point : farmers need to plan ahead and they need policy stability . #% The security issues must be addressed , but not at the expense of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians . #% Mr President , the Northern hake stock is outside safe biological limits . #% At the heart of the issue is the failure to implement properly the 1973 First Non-life Assurance Directive and subsequent relevant directives . #% If we truly believe and truly want a common statute there should be no transitional system . #% It is incorrect and it is wrong . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this debate and I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work . #% Last year , the Commission was actually trying to do something ; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers . #% I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonight 's debate to continue with infringement proceedings . #% In it they say `` we pray at your end , honourable European Parliamentarians , that justice may prevail on us '' . #% The cost of the new building is unjustifiable . #% The Irish Government themselves have ignored the mandate that they clearly got from the people . #% I also wish to thank the Secretariat for its input . #% I join my colleagues in supporting calls for Europe to make a real offer of financing to the developing world to help it fight climate change in order to break the deadlock in the current negotiations . #% What goes for Azerbaijan should certainly go for a Member State of the European Union as well . #% The petitioners and complainants invested in what they thought was a properly regulated market according to UK and EU law . #% So either you give the floor to Mr Alavanos , or I would like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question . #% Truly a war of civilisations . #% I would echo the words of Mr Poettering -- and indeed I have learned from my own experience -- that it is much easier to make war than it is to make peace . #% Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience . #% On the question of aid funding , I believe that the budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country . #% Mr President , I thank the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , and Commissioner Busquin , who have both helped us to work efficiently , as have the shadow rapporteurs . #% What should Europe 's role be in an increasingly globalised world and how can the European Union be brought closer to its citizens ? #% You will not do that , Commissioner , by creating a situation in which it can continue . #% . Mr President , I would like to thank the author of the oral question and Mrs Attwooll for presenting it , particularly as she is missing her group 's Christmas party this evening by being here , which shows her true dedication . #% If not , it will come up tomorrow before the vote . #% While I understand the argument that bona fide cloning experimentation may contribute to scientific advances which would alleviate human suffering , I must point out that there exists a loophole for the totally unacceptable usage of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells , cultures ` out of their natural environment ' . #% Neither the Israelis nor the Americans want to give us any significant role . #% The problem in Vietnam is also that domestic human rights monitoring is not allowed , and that independent human rights monitors continue to be prevented from visiting the country . #% So we in this Parliament must use every means at our disposal to highlight this situation and put pressure on the Kenyan authorities to see whether they will respect basic human rights . #% It is in the interest of all the contracting parties that the bottom-line issues that remain outstanding are debated , resolved and finalised . #% I fully support the rapporteur in his proposals that the measure should only be introduced on a temporary basis and that aid should be introduced to cushion the effects on the sectors which are most affected . #% A key requirement in rural regions is access to information technology : to IT training and broadband . #% Mr President , nothing justifies the use of terrorism . #% If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is . #% I challenge her to do so , but instead I fear we will hear the usual Sinn Féin empty , pious , weasel words that reek of insincerity , with hypocrisy dripping from every syllable . #% It is certainly worth saying that , when the ILO was created in 1919 after the Treaty of Versailles , which ended the First World War , it was to reflect the belief that universal and lasting peace can only be accomplished if it is based on social justice . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . - Mr President , I should begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his very positive speech , and on everything he is doing in this area . #% However , the President-in-Office has made a very good start . #% If a farmer , his son or his daughter has an opportunity or an idea to develop their farm or to diversify , they should be encouraged to do so and to expand and not be forced into the nearest town or village . #% But yes , the organic sector is growing . #% We need it more than the larger states . #% Why can we not establish the sustainability of a wild bird or a species before trade begins ? #% We need to focus more on promoting and securing acceptance of women as they are , rather than allowing the advertising industry to impose some sort of idea of beauty as the norm . #% Research shows that the situation in my own state of Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe . #% Why is it that one euro was deducted from the minimum wage ? #% 
We have just debated the bathing water directive and it is quite incredible to think that we are talking here about a Member State of the EU irresponsibly posing a major threat to our bathing waters and also to our fishing industry . #% One of the things that was not widely understood was the importance of this policy from a social point of view : the fact is , that in all the depressed regions of the Union , the common agricultural policy has maintained the population and supported communities , in a social sense , that would not otherwise have survived . #% The Commission is too soft on this issue and it needs to be more radical . #% From an Irish perspective I welcome the recent initiative by the Irish Government which seeks to make Ireland the centre of electronic commerce in Europe in the very near future . #% The Irish presidency has made good preparation for its period in office . #% The EU has accepted these ideas for some stocks and I think it is high time that it implemented them for its own stocks . #% Madam President , when I heard that poor Mr Blak was in trouble again I naturally rushed to see what could be done about it as quickly as possible . #% Could I just point out the number of outbreaks in the UK yesterday was higher than at any time in the three weeks since the crisis started . #% I shall read one paragraph from the report : ` The study concluded that transport had no adverse effect on animal welfare based on the physiological , immunological and haematological measurements made ' . #% Many varieties of seed , both cereal and vegetable , are no longer in everyday use . #% So far as the arguments against the best available technology are concerned , they do not stand up to scrutiny . #% I hope we will not be looking back in a year 's time at another 100 000 dead . #% This would give us and the least-developed countries a distinct advantage over the US , which would find it hard to separate GM crops and natural equivalents . #% They document a massive loss of species , both plant and animal , as a result of climate change . #% However , the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP . #% The FIFG is due to continue until 2006 and so there are several years in which these reforms could bring some sort of positive effect . #% . Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder for the very collegiate and cooperative way in which he has worked with other committees , and Mrs Gill for the same reason . #% There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered . #% The modulation funds must go back to the farmer and must not be thrown away on useless projects that have no hope of surviving . #% My main priority has been to achieve legal certainty for industry . #% It is anticipated that this committee will report back to the Greater London Assembly by the summer . #% Mr Martin also accused me of some 32 problem cases of claiming the daily allowance . #% We are shortly going to cross the final hurdles so as to bring about the accession of 10 new Member States to the Union . #% In order to achieve this properly in this very difficult situation , careful monitoring of the funds and how they are disbursed is most important . #% China seems unwilling to accept binding targets . #% There is one way to ensure peace of mind , not only for our farmers and poultry producers but also for consumers , and that is to increase the resources of the Food and Veterinary Office so that it can keep the situation under surveillance . #% Needless to say , I disagree with my Irish colleague , Mrs McKenna , because I believe that the establishment of an EU defence policy is as much an essential prerequisite of genuine European integration as the single currency . #% Let us ensure that this is made more explicit after Doha . #% Harmonising electoral systems for the European election could actually be detrimental to the very fair and equitable system that we have in Ireland , and most people in this Parliament are probably totally unaware of that . #% Unless we are willing to cooperate with each other and learn from the best practices available , we can not hope to resolve these difficulties . #% Mr President , I would like to thank most sincerely our rapporteur Mr Perry for his report on the Lloyd 's Petitions which date back to 1997 . #% This directive , part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent , should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU , and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment . #% Let us grasp the opportunities that have been given to Romania and Bulgaria today , but , most importantly of all , let us grasp the opportunities which have been given to the European Union to act as a beacon of hope , of democracy , of freedom , of respect for human rights , across the world . #% The only way we are going to do that is to ensure that environmental damage is considered one of the most serious crimes in our society . #% Member States are adding too many cumbersome requirements to European directives , thus making it difficult for insurance companies to operate in other Member States . #% I would be anxious to ensure that any Eurodac register would be fair , reasonable and compassionate in its application . #% The proposals of the Irish presidency under the title ` Outline for a draft revision of the Treaties ' are the distillation of views and opinions gathered from a myriad of discussions , debate and seminars at political and official level with academics , NGOs and social partners , a process that began under the Italian presidency and gathered momentum during the last six months . #% It is also clear that negotiations on the provisions of the new EU treaty are being somewhat fast-tracked . #% While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding , it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject , if perchance this legislation , which has already spanned two legislatures , gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg , as was my concern from the start . #% Irish People , along with all Europeans live with the constant concern that an accident in the UK or France or a collision in the Irish Sea , could have devastating and immediate effects on us all . #% One is that we should somehow try to legislate , or to get Member States to legislate , for the 0.7 % of GNP contribution , as required by our commitment to the United Nations . #% You can not be unaware of its significance to some people here tonight . #% I welcome the measures proposed by the Commission to ease the direct transit of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia . #% It is vital , therefore , that we support a compromise that ensures the effective control and enforcement of workers ' rights by keeping the original purpose of the directive . #% It is a bad mistake and gives a wrong signal . #% While I know that the original intention was and still is to bring Mr McCartney 's murderers to justice , that search for justice has influenced the political landscape in Northern Ireland . #% I have no doubt that those who have spoken here regard it as a serious matter . #% We would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and can not deal with . #% Is it wise for this Parliament to start telling people what to eat , rather than providing them with information of what they are eating ? #% 500 of these 7 000 athletes will be coming from areas affected by SARS . #% It is all very well to have products that are labelled according to their area of farming or according status as a traditional speciality , but unless the consumer is aware of its meaning , it is , in fact , like reading an alien language . #% We should also not permit the human rights instrument , which Parliament has consistently been calling for , to be used to make us relinquish our policy-setting powers . #% Mr President , could I ask the President-in-Office once again to restate so everybody can hear that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a non-binding political declaration as approved by the Heads of State and Heads of Government in Nice . #% The abolition of import quotas on 1 January 2005 has , in the UK and elsewhere , caused soaring imports , especially from China . #% Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks . #% One small word of caution : let us not overplay our role and move into an area where we might be overlapping the negotiating mandate of the Commission . #% In the Middle Ages half the population of Europe was destroyed . #% The purpose of my putting this question was to shift the emphasis , because poverty can not be tackled through a continuation of the same old formula . #% Today 's budget in Ireland reflects the good health of our celtic tiger . #% The majority of the people in my own country support our Minister for Finance and the only people who do not are those in opposition in my country and they are using the recommendation of the Commission for what they deem to be short-term political advantage . #% Just look at the United States ' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan . #% Without longterm guarantees I am not sure it is sensible to talk , as the proposal does , of further adapting agriculture to the marketplace because this usually means lower prices and increased costs for the people in rural areas . #% Only USD 3 billion a year is being spent globally in trying to halt the spread of AIDS . #% Perfluorooctane sulfonates - PFOS - are chlorinated compounds with numerous applications in consumer products such as textiles and paper , are known for their repellent properties , amongst others , and are used daily in many consumer products . #% Mr President , I am speaking on the broad economic guidelines . #% This Parliament obviously shares the Commission 's desire for greater efficiency , simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain , but can not allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself . #% 
To a large extent the problem we face in Iraq is the unfinished business of the Gulf War . #% Indeed , officials from your own office , Commissioner , recently met representatives of the fisheries committee in the Irish Parliament , as well as meeting members of the Committee on Fisheries here in the European Parliament , to discuss the issue of criminal sanctions and administrative sanctions . #% The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish , not to mention damage to non-targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as coral beds . #% The Union and the applicant countries must sit down and hammer out an agreement on the difficult chapters of the discussions because otherwise enlargement of the Union can not take place quickly and will not be a success . #% We have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available . #% It has refused to take up any of our suggestions to safeguard jobs and ensure safety standards are improved . #% Indeed , this is further evidence for the need to enhance maternity and paternity leave provisions to enable women and men to strike a balance between work and family commitments . #% Mr President , the enlargement process is the bridge from the old Europe to the new . #% It is not his first visit to Strasbourg - he has been here on quite a number of occasions to prepare the groundwork in a careful way for a successful presidency , which I very much hope and am sure will emerge . #% Or is it simply a case of a voluntary agreement that you hope to have with Member States ? #% Mr President , I thank you for your very kind remarks about Women 's Day , and a very happy day to all the brothers and sisters in the House and indeed in the gallery . #% We should not go along with the US missile defence system . #% There remains the issue of the 'em pty Annexes ' . #% I hope that the Spanish Government can reach agreement quickly on the location of these important agencies , in particular the European Food Authority and the European Maritime Safety Agency . #% The review must be undertaken by the European Parliament in cooperation with the Ombudsman 's office and I hope that we can get review under way quite soon . #% I appeal to you to bear in mind that you represent Europe , not Portugal . #% Flooding from the River Barrow , the second longest river in Ireland , has meant much of Carlow has been under water for over four days ! #% I ask you , Commissioner - and I would like an answer - what part does our development aid play in this kind of suffering ? #% I wish to say on behalf of my group that when the IGC comes we will continue to press for Treaty reform on the question of individual accountability . #% in writing . - The issue voted on refers to issues of regulation of media ownership . #% We must all reflect on the difficulties of the last twelve months in particular and learn from the mistakes that were clearly made . #% I ask today are we satisfied that enough is being done ? #% The technical measures are all about trying to increase the selectivity of EU fishing practices . #% In so doing they struck a blow for millions of democrats across Europe , who were denied a say by the totalitarian attempt of the EU elite to foist the Lisbon Treaty on us all . #% The rapporteur was correct to point out that in view of the Kyoto timetable , we must be careful not to invalidate the directive by a long transition period , particularly for certification in specific areas . #% Similarly , dispersal of 1200g of powdered plutonium would deliver lethal doses of radiation by inhalation with a radius of more than 2 km . #% I feel , however , that we should be consistent here with other accession reports . #% The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law . #% Of course , this summit was spun in the media as a success when , in truth , we got nothing but waffle . #% There have been thousands of victims in the conflict of Northern Ireland . #% If both we and the US work together in common cause , there is just a possibility that we could halt the continuing slide into regional conflict and restore peace negotiations once again on the basis of the Mitchell recommendations . #% The fact is that the Commission has not enforced the Directive , and many Member States ignore its provisions . #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Hong Kong , the current status of the Macau Special Administrative Region holds obvious interest to me , and I have been fortunate enough to visit the region twice within the last year . #% I would like to say a special word of thanks and appreciation to Mr Santer for the magnificent work he has done for the European Union for the last four-and-a-half years . #% I firmly believe that the vast majority of the Irish people are committed to the enlargement process and I do not want to see the timeframe for the enlargement of the European Union to include countries from Eastern and Central Europe delayed as a direct consequence of the decision of the Irish people last week . #% From listening to this debate , one would not think so . #% If it is simply to provide for the provision of temporary cross-border provisions , how does it lead to a competitive integrated services market ? #% E-mail was non-existent on personal computers worldwide , but this is now changing at an accelerating rate . #% Therefore , we can no longer speak of exclusively having a social model that works according to the old ideology of high taxation and high social protection . #% You have to make reality the codes of conduct which have appeared very late . #% It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies . #% The US seems unable to pass legislation to curb its excessive CO2 emissions . #% Generally , you have a very good line -- up . #% It further stresses that respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law by all parties and under all circumstances is an essential precondition for achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East . #% Commissioner , you will probably remember that the late Phillip Whitehead , the former chairman of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , asked you as a Commission to take action . #% It is true that there are , in many cases , health and psychological reasons for breast implants , but we need to be careful in that regard . #% The European Commission has made a proposal which would ensure that consumers would have the right to take action in their own national courts and legal disputes arising from cross-border e-commerce transactions . #% I also oppose the Council 's position that Member States should be given eight years , rather than the five years proposed by Parliament , to ensure that existing landfill sites comply with the terms laid out in this directive . #% The next stage will be commercial exploitation , which our own bio-patenting directive allows for . #% In the General Election in a week 's time people in the regions will judge the government on their inability to deal with regional policy issues . #% We are attempting to raise the political temperature on this issue to increase the pressure on those who can , if the will exists , make things happen on the ground to protect people . #% I should also like to add my thanks to the Commission , to the Commissioners present , and all the others who have worked so hard during the period I have been in this Parliament . #% These amendments acknowledge the exploitative and ethically controversial nature of embryonic procurement and research and recognise that in order to fully respect the subsidiarity principle , EU funds should not be distributed to research that is illegal in various Member States . #% We urgently need to streamline the way we carry out our business in Europe and the sooner we secure agreement the better . #% I wish to give just one example of this . #% The truth is , and we have got to face it , Saddam Hussein has effectively made fools out of the international community ever since that time . #% However , particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland , whose prosperity and employment levels depend , to a large extent , on its capacity to attract foreign investment . #% That is not in any way to undermine or to ignore the suffering people have gone through . #% I also welcome the fact that we have a press release from the Commission on this . #% If it makes things more difficult , that is because it is a precautionary approach , it is the way we should approach aquaculture . #% I do not question your right , Commissioner , to do what you did , but I question your judgment . #% The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth , with notably Ireland , Finland , Greece , Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments . #% This regulation before us has the objective of applying these rights against the EU institutions : Parliament , the Council , the Commission , the ECJ , the European Investment Bank , . #% The directive puts downward pressure on wages and provides companies with numerous loopholes which they can exploit to pay less than the minimum wage . #% Under what criteria do you meet people ? #% I am also asking for support on Amendment 20 , which seeks to recognise the potential of assisted-living housing . #% 
The Commission has decided that the time for action is now , and I endorse this view . #% It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers . #% I also very much welcome the inclusion of sustainability objectives and the equal status given to sustainability together with competition and with security of supply . #% But incineration has to be considered as a last resort and - as has been said already - waste reduction , re-use and recycling are the main things we should be striving for . #% There are clearly circumstances relating to the island of Ireland and the isolated position of Greece as far as railways are concerned which require to be taken into account . #% I think there is unity in diversity and I would like to say that I feel myself very much a soulmate of the honourable Member in raising this question . #% Therefore , Mr President , could you contact the editors concerned in the Independent Newspaper Group and ask them to carry a correction of the remarks you made ? #% This will be the job of Commissioner Wallström , who will have a key role in explaining how Europe takes its decisions and why Europe makes these decisions . #% Setting the threshold at 150 GWP does not exclude the further refinement of CO2 technology , but it would allow our car manufacturers to maintain market penetration in all areas of the world . #% It would , of course , make it easier for other firms to enter , but it would also make it easier for Irish companies to do business abroad . #% This is the second time this has happened to me and the third time it has happened to my colleague Mr Aylward . #% Madam President , for the past six months to a year , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been calling on the Commission to do something about the drought in Ethiopia . #% I also want to congratulate you , Mr Spring , on your success last week with regard to ending the impasse on the MEDA programme . #% I would not trust any information that I get from an area with such meagre resources about what is happening in their waters . #% The truth is something different . #% The proposed slaughter premium , while it is a contentious issue , is not a good replacement system . #% I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector , the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion , which is a considerable proportion of the budget . #% I happen to believe that if you are going to have real control of the finances of the European Union , it can only be best carried out at Member State level , because the Member States also have the ability to follow such controls through . #% We know of a recent victim . #% If this means waiting for a second-reading agreement , then so be it . #% TGV is not an option for us . #% Unemployment levels should be used to determine eligibility for structural fund aid . #% I hope there will be plenty of men around when I need care at the end of my life . #% A small operator would not only be able to bid for and win a contract that would normally be beyond its capacity to complete ; but would continue to reap certain benefits even after the contract had been completed . #% It is time the European Union insisted that this resolution bring about real and sustained results . #% The Greens sympathise with their plight and trust that appropriate compensation will be made available for those fishery workers who are put out of work in the eventuality of a halt in fishing activities . #% Basically , the tragedy in Bam was totally horrific , with tens of thousands of people dead and the infrastructure of this very historical city destroyed . #% Every Member State has its own sneaky little tricks for making sure that people do not find it too easy to go to other countries and practice their professions . #% Its proposed premium period of ten years is far too short and its proposed grant rate is too low . #% Madam President , today offers an important corrective opportunity and an important step forward in this debate . #% We all know that the accession of ten new countries is not an easy task . #% It is our responsibility therefore to ensure that the wishes , not just of Parliament but also of the candidate countries who had travelled here and of the Member State representatives who came , concerning the position on the family are accurately presented , otherwise our time has been wasted . #% The Italian Government needs to be commended for accelerating the pace of these negotiations , and the holding of this recent meeting in Naples was a very timely one . #% At the same time , asylum issues are growing in importance . #% This can only happen if we seriously adjust the structures and procedures of the WTO . #% Firstly , there is clearly good will among European Union leaders to secure an agreement for a new European Union Treaty , and I would like to commend the efforts of the President of the Council , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern , for the very positive role he has played in moving these negotiations forward in recent times . #% I would ask Commissioner Flynn , who is with us here today , where he stands on this issue . #% Today 's vote means that we can now sign up to the WIPO Treaty and we can give international copyright protection to our creative industries . #% I have referred constituency cases to the SOLVIT network and have been impressed with how the issues have been handled and with the prompt responses to our questions . #% However , I have often thought that development cooperation is one area in which we could improve our cooperation . #% Yet surrounding it are grave and serious political issues that are not getting the quality time and attention that we believe they need if this is to be a success . #% This is the primary aim of this resolution . #% Perhaps that is something that our local authorities should look at : whether or not forestry schemes should require planning approval . #% To take account of this , I have added a clarification to include transit whenever importation is mentioned in the Directive . #% The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate . #% I am not surprised by the statistic which indicates that there has been a decline in the number of women participating in employers ' organisations . #% All conflict is about difference , whether it is a matter of race , religion or nationality . #% Madam President , I wish to point out that when we vote on the structural fund aspects of the greening block , in fact , our amendments and the comments on this line contravene the structural fund regulations . #% We consider that Malta has a natural vocation , both in terms of its democratic institutions and respect for human rights , to form an integral part of the European Union . #% It is completely unacceptable that the space policy and EU resources should be funding and facilitating military expansion or the development of new military weapons . #% The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity . #% In the immediate term , the need to assemble aid and coordinate its distribution is fundamental , particularly in inaccessible parts of the disaster zones . #% I look forward to the day when the EU will be compliant with its Kyoto obligation on f-gases . #% It is important that we support the continuation of the SAVE energy efficiency programme with a budget of ECU 120m for the period from 1996 to 2000 . #% I believe that is where Agenda 2000 proposals will take us unless we make changes without delay . #% This concession , which comes on top of the pain of CAP reform , involves sacrifice for Europe 's rural communities . #% I want the Commissioner to ensure that whatever is brought in is unified throughout the European Union and is financed in a unified way so that no one Member State can pour in more money than another to support their particular industry . #% Nothing I can say can adequately express the gratitude that the Irish people on both sides of the border feel for the investment that Europe has made for the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland , the border counties in the Irish Republic and the Northern Ireland Peace Process . #% Finally , let me record my opposition to the proposed minimum expenditure levels in the Commission 's proposal . #% My question also relates to the historical responsibility of the European Union , including the presidency , for colonialism and for the atrocities committed in various states . #% This mission has troops coming from Sweden , the Netherlands , Poland , Austria and Ireland . #% I believe that the Environment Committee has in this instance made a valuable contribution to the original Commission proposal . #% Questions concerning collective bargaining or collective agreements are a matter for the Member States themselves and not for anyone else . #% The Commissioner and others have said that it is too early yet to draw conclusions . #% We need more time and debate on these potential conflicts . #% The second key question is the issue of interoperability , and the McCarthy amendments in this area are worth supporting . #% 
The scale and European-wide nature of this problem have been tragically highlighted by these episodes and it is up to us as a European Community to respond far better than we have done heretofore . #% The actions of the Israeli army are simply disproportionate and this is a view that is shared by Kofi Annan , the EU foreign ministers and many more . #% Whereas some of these areas certainly are under the British Crown , there is no doubt whatever that , for example , the Isle of Man is the most Irish of locations . #% Now that the Summit is over , the vital work of ensuring sustainable development has to continue . #% If there is a precious and scarce resource , why do we exploit it and give it away at prices that are far below its real value ? #% It is important that we do not let this day go by without acknowledging the initiative taken by Germany , France and Belgium in proposing further United Nations intervention in Iraq to consolidate the search for weapons of mass destruction in that country . #% in writing . - I am supportive of extending the coastal limits from 12 to 20 miles as one of the key reforms of the CFP . #% It would be extremely strange if the European Parliament did not support this last request . #% Madam President , the EPP Group welcomes this initiative particularly because it is the first initiative on discard tabled by the European Union . #% Finally , I welcome the amendment respecting the principle of subsidiarity , which in this case gives legal certainty to Member States to opt out of the use of certain ethically controversial cells . #% The agriculture industry certainly does not need anymore bad publicity and I support Mr Stevenson 's position on the amendments put forward by Mr Mulder . #% It would seem that for the US , the transatlantic relationship is simply one of convenience , to be used when it suits , but ignored when US policy and interests take priority . #% We can not wait for a cooperation that will not come . #% Enlargement will surely offer opportunities to our regions but we will want to ensure that the proposals presented by the Commission match our objectives and priorities as socialists , namely to continue the Delors legacy of promoting jobs , sustainable growth and the competitiveness of our regions and the central objective of economic and social cohesion of the Treaty to enable all citizens , regions and Member States to participate on an equal footing . #% So , the sheepmeat policy is a very good one . #% I have no doubt that the greater majority of your fishermen would ask you to do the same thing . #% The success of economic and monetary union has eliminated the possibility of seeing hungry speculators playing one currency off against the other for personal gain , while doing serious economic damage to European countries and to their citizens . #% Some estimates have suggested that at least half of the hundreds of the Palestinians killed have been civilians . #% Almost no foodstuffs are inherently bad . #% Macau does boast a sound education system but its economic dependence on gambling and textiles , and its failure to attract high-tech industries do not augur well for the future employment prospects of the young population . #% We must also recognize the leadership of Chancellor Kohl . #% Such democratic deficit is one of the design defects of this EU . #% Since then , there has been such intimidation within the community that it has resulted in silence : people live in fear of reprisals if they speak out . #% This does not just concern major oil companies , it also concerns other European multinationals which ignore their responsibilities for human rights , for the environment and for basic civil liberties . #% Who would like to have their baby delivered by a doctor , a junior obstetrician after being on duty for 70 hours ? #% I know we are all concerned about the matters raised by the honourable Member . #% Therefore , the opposition you express to Sweden 's social model is not news to me . #% A resolution is clearly overdue and the question of compensation can not be side-stepped . #% Secondly , Rule 19 governs order and the conduct of the House . #% The death penalty , children 's rights -- and , in particular , children in armed conflict -- women 's rights and gender equality , the role of international business in human rights , human rights in the fight against terrorism and the role of the ICC in the fight against impunity are all issues that need to be given continued priority by consecutive Council presidencies and the Commission . #% We get very little opportunity to speak to the Commissioner . #% Local job creation initiatives must be supported by national and European Member States . #% Finally I would ask this particular question : is it because the vast majority of cabin crew are women that licensing was not introduced a long time ago ? #% Madam President , very soon the European Parliament will vote on public access to documents . #% However , I fear that we sometimes talk about this issue with great intensity -- as we should -- but ignore the bigger picture of commodity production in the European Union , which also needs protection . #% One is to protect the stability of the financial services market , and the other is to protect the interests of the investor . #% This issue has grave implications for every maritime state in the EU and it has resulted in the cancellation in Ireland of social partnership negotiations . #% Mr President , it is not actually on my own question but on behalf of Mr Gallagher , whose question is No 10 . #% The only person who mentioned the Swedish social model was the Swedish Minister for Industry . #% The Lisbon Treaty strengthened cohesion policy and thus , it is in all our interests that the future cohesion policy stimulates the development potential of the entire EU , encourages greater competitiveness of the European economy , and improves the quality of our lives . #% That is an important act of solidarity , and an important point of departure . #% How one judges the conference is a matter of opinion . #% If Objective 1 status was accorded to the midland region , it would develop as a region on the back of the infrastructural improvements such as the Portlaoise bypass , so as to attract more investment and create more jobs . #% The whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this House to act . #% But we had been in contact with the Netherlands , which represent the presidency , and they were asked to investigate the matter . #% I welcome the appointment of Commissioner-designate Kuneva and Commissioner-designate Orban , and I hope that all colleagues within this Chamber will not use political points to try and attack them in the important role that they will undertake in the future . #% Passports are now obligatory for all horses and contain a new annex for recording of veterinary treatments . #% It is imperative for all of us in this House , if possible , to avoid a second reading . #% I understand the final meeting is to take place today . #% Subsidiarity and decentralization must be the cornerstone of our future policies to ensure that our regional policies are relevant to the needs and interests of local communities . #% I welcome the partial lifting of the ban . #% It was a very useful development of thinking in the area of services of general interest , trying to define some of the territory and to mark out what is appropriate for the European Union . #% In this respect , it is worth mentioning the work of KIMO International and their ` Fishing for Litter ' Project . #% We expect and demand no less of our future partners . #% We want to see that promoted . #% Very often rust-bucket , single-hull , decaying tankers carry enormous quantities of oil which are , in effect , environmental weapons of mass destruction . #% But there is no reason , with an up-turn , that we should not , with public procurement and public funds , be launching far more satellites in the future for public , citizen benefit . #% Is it not time that we really got serious about this ? #% Mr President , for a moment I thought we were being left out . #% To conclude , consumer information must be complete and accurate . #% There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry . #% I agree with the rapporteur that this report is not about harmonisation ; it is about better coordination of the social security systems in Member States . #% The text before us is a very worthwhile contribution to the future development of rural areas . #% I have two very brief supplementaries in regard to that . #% For example a United Nations peacekeeping force in the 1960s in the Belgian Congo ( now Zaire ) oversaw what may have been an uneasy peace but , nonetheless , a vital one . #% We can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which is globalising fast . #% 
The European Union is committed to working closely with the UN , the US and Russia in seeking ways to encourage and assist the parties involved to end the conflict and move towards a permanent peace . #% In my own Member State , citizens advice bureaux are acting as a clearing-house . #% It is quite clear that the fortress mentality of Europe is what is causing people to put their lives at risk , by trusting people who are trying to make a profit . #% Outreach services need to be put in place so that these women and children can access the necessary services and be protected from violence . #% I wish you well and I will be with you right along the way . #% The rate of this tax should fully reflect each Member State 's requirements environmental , economic and physical . #% The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur , Mr Khanbhai . #% Likewise , we as legislators demand full respect from all sections and services within the Commission for our role . #% We are going to be using that new building and therefore we have a duty to have these questions answered . #% To date , the Council has failed to heed these calls . #% We allow food imports into the EU and , at the very least , we need to ensure that the standards of our imports meet those of our home-produced food . #% Under this directive there is a requirement to put in place trend reversal measures once pollution levels reach 75 per cent of the decreed quality standard . #% This Parliament and the European Union should , and must , be most vigorous in pursuing full answers to these most important public health and human rights issues . #% For example , there is a restriction on cigarette advertising on television , yet there is no restriction on alcohol advertising on television . #% We can only recognise the full potential of business-to-consumer e-commerce if sufficient trust and confidence is there . #% In the College of Quaestors we have also discussed - because we too are concerned - robberies that are taking place within Parliament . #% That is exactly what this debate on the Green Paper can do : ensure that we open up this whole area , focus on the major problems of stigma and discrimination and exchange best practice and epidemiological figures on this area . #% There is a growing awareness in Europe of the dimensions of the threat from the very well-resourced , very well-targeted United States of America . #% I compliment the candidate countries on their efforts to conform to the stringent requirements for entry . #% The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU . #% We certainly need action , because the disease travels extremely fast and we have to be able to vaccinate outside affected areas . #% This is the most unacceptable position for me . #% So , if this provision is removed from the technical measures regulation , as the Commission is proposing , then Member States will not be able to impose stricter measures outside their own waters . #% It is not a very generous outlay of money , but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best , then the money can be usefully spent . #% Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that . #% Madam President , I wish to speak on this report because it is necessary for the European Union to find a more effective way to ensure that Member States who make commitments in relation to matters of life and death actually comply with those commitments . #% In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands . #% Mr President , the principles of integrated coastal zone management are accepted worldwide as a mechanism to enable sustainable management of coastal areas . #% We need a system whereby those who have been convicted of paedophile offences are registered both nationally and internationally , with access only available to legal officers or those considering offering employment with privileged access to children . #% That should not be in his report . #% There is no such thing as national borders . #% I have no confidence that , without sustained international pressure at the highest possible level , Burma will make the positive transition to democracy . #% A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness . #% Near-misses are being reported more frequently . #% Therefore , we should study how that was done and how the philosophy behind it was sent to every area of conflict . #% I fully support the right of junior doctors and doctors in training to secure the benefits of this directive , but the Conciliation Committee conclusions will have reluctantly to be accepted . #% Within the European Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime has been put in place following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam . #% The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small , and its impact is political rather economic - though that is important too . #% When we look at horses that have been used for recreational purposes that end up going into the human food chain , it is essential that a precautionary approach is taken to ensure that public health and consumer protection take priority . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to undertake to look into this matter of the Scotch-Irish language and see to it that the principle of equality be implemented with regard to this language , along with all the other languages of the European Union , so that they can all stand on a level playing field . #% However , the human population explosion , combined with an expanding urban -- and world -- market system , has changed this . #% I , like others , have concerns about proper controls on third-country imports . #% The main priority of the European Union is jobs . #% I am aware of the report brought forward by Mr Hyland which he has referred to . #% These are matters that must be faced , they can not be swept away . #% Mr President , torture is always wrong and counterproductive . #% I do not take advantage in that way to make a point of order which is not relevant . #% That is why we are voting against this report . #% Otherwise , all research money , all researchers , all the top graduates at doctorate level will move to the US , Japan or elsewhere , because that is where their ideas can be protected and there is bigger investment . #% The whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual Members and also in Member States . #% This Parliament has to call for a number of things : recognition of Alzheimer 's disease as a major health scourge within the meaning of Article 129 of the Treaty ; establishment of an action programme to combat Alzheimer 's disease and related disorders within the priorities of the new Community public health programme ; recognition of the important role played by family care givers , Alzheimer 's Europe and their national member organizations ; and finally , the establishment of a European network and support for existing networks working with people with Alzheimer 's . #% To some extent this debate has now been superseded by the decision of the Heads of State to adhere to the decisions taken in Berlin . #% We must respect that decision . #% I hope that this report represents the first stage in a concerted battle against this type of fraud . #% Their work is , in itself , an example of intergenerational support and needs socio-economic recognition , although not as a substitute to the development of quality care services . #% The provisions of the Treaty of Nice do not change that . #% Particular emphasis will be placed on setting up schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help early school leavers . #% In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes . #% The Euratom Treaty is one of the founding Treaties of the Union , along with the Treaty of Rome . #% In conclusion , I want to take the opportunity to refer to the other group - the junior doctors . #% Internally and externally our economic relations are set to reach a new plane . #% President Prodi has talked about the indispensable necessity of the institutional triangle : the Commission , Parliament and Council . #% The European Council has since launched two action plans to combat organised crime , aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and encouraging more efficient judicial cooperation . #% Consistency and the rate of implementation need to be improved if the Lisbon objectives and the challenges of globalisation are realistically to be met . #% In conclusion , I am pleased that the recent uncertainty regarding the timetable for enlargement , which was partly due to our rejection of the Treaty of Nice in the first Irish referendum , has been removed . #% Unless you are a person with a disability , you do not know what is necessary to allow you to participate in society on an equal footing . #% 
We need to train and retain scientists ; women scientists in particular are a wasted resource . #% It also points out that Ireland has failed to implement the 1991 Health and Safety Directive covering agency workers . #% In the past where conflicts have arisen in relation to the legal basis , the Council has always rejected the Commission 's view and has changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94 . #% On the other hand , I feel deep disappointment at the result of all the discussions , at the waste of work which went into drawing up more ambitious proposals , at the lost opportunities , at the lack of investment in Europe 's economy and at the failure to respond to the challenge to our economy from elsewhere in the world . #% This would only help to erode public confidence in the institutions of the Union , which would be a very regressive step for all interested parties , particularly in the light of the key challenges that lie ahead for the Union as a political and economic entity . #% We must do what we can to make the Internet safer . #% When we come here and complain about fraud in the area of Community spending we get satisfaction , figures and action , but never in the area of fishing . #% The liberalization of electricity directive is one big reason why there will not be investment in nuclear power in Western Europe . #% The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions . #% It is about the Petten reactor in Holland , which we are always assured is for medical research . #% I found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years . #% It is not acceptable that these implants should be advertised as simple and straightforward , with no indication that there are medical risks involved . #% The final package must perforce reflect Parliament 's priorities . #% We wish Albania to understand clearly that the European Union will only be able to continue to develop its political and economic relations with Albania if progress on the introduction of democratic reforms continue to be made . #% We have moved from a time when there was heavy industrialised and intensive labour areas of industry , to other smaller networks , smaller cooperation . #% The accusation the Commissioner made here that it is for people in favour of abolition and that we who are against it want to support the hidden subsidies to the alcohol , tobacco and travel industries is not true . #% The approach of these reports is based on the need to create a system of transparency and understanding , so that citizens of the European Union can be confident that when they have a legitimate complaint they have recourse to the Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions , depending on the nature of their problem . #% In the course of lunchtime today I received a telephone call from a prominent radio station in my constituency which attributed opinions and behaviour along the following lines indirectly to myself as a Member of this Parliament in relation to our new building in Brussels : ' there are people in Brussels who are getting massive backhanders , there is serious racketeering going on , the procedures in Parliament have not been properly followed and Parliament has gone against its own Rules in the matter of its buildings policy . ' #% What it wants is access at high prices , because that is the only way that it can grow and prosper . #% They are not even afraid of further development or enlargement of the European Union . #% Deprived communities , poor children and elderly people are amongst the most vulnerable to climate change health risks . #% The fact is that the Internet genie is out of the bottle . #% In the European Union we land something like 10 % of the world 's industrial catches , and it is sold for approximately 30 % of the value of fish that is caught for human consumption . #% deputising for the rapporteur . - Mr President , we have had a very good debate this evening . #% During 2005 , some 4.9 million people became newly infected with the virus . #% - I respect the reasons for which the British delegation has abstained on Amendments Nos 5 and 8 - junior doctors - but I have not followed this line since firstly , this is a negotiating position and secondly , my close family experience of a highly stressed and overworked NHS midwife do not allow me to impose long working hours on vital medical staff for any longer than is absolutely necessary . #% I abhor this particular line of argument particularly in light of the fact that there has been a number of tragic deaths in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy . #% This is clearly going to be the route taken in future to circumvent legislation both here and in the United States . #% This is a very serious issue . #% In particular in relation to the installation he mentions , I will bring his comments to the attention of the Commission and ask if it sees grounds for taking any action . #% The people working on the site and living in the surrounding areas have paid a very heavy price for faulty design , very poor maintenance and a very risky working environment . #% Creating a Community of 25 countries will eventually involve close to a 30 % increase and will have serious implications for the annual budget . #% I also thank Commissioner Dimas . #% I would like to raise the question of whether we in the European Union would be prepared to share the vaccines we already have in our possession with regions where an outbreak occurs , in an effort to contain it . #% We need more secure systems if we are to boost consumer confidence in using the Internet . #% This morning in the Irish newspapers there was yet another report of a killing as a result of feuds between drug gangs - the fifth in Ireland alone in the last year . #% This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency . #% Mr President , at the outset I want to take the opportunity of congratulating Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on the preparation and presentation of his report . #% Indeed , here I hope you will not adopt the Stoiber formulation referred to by Mr Barón Crespo . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of the House the problems faced by the rendering industry in the United Kingdom as a result of European Union legislation setting standards for incineration plants in the United Kingdom , namely the Waste Incineration Directive , which is now due to be implemented by the end of this year . #% Make no mistake , this war is about oil . #% We want to give serious consideration to the setting up of an energy programme agency with the task of producing the coherent energy strategy I mentioned . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his report this morning and his presentation and for pointing out to us the problems that we have in this area . #% At a time when multiple crises seriously threaten the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is all the more important to ensure that our development policies are not undermined by action in other policy fields . #% About 85 % of the people arriving in Ireland have not been stopped at the original port of call or processed in the country in which they originally arrived in the Community . #% I want to address this paper on that basis . #% It is a shame on this House that we do so . #% It is important for the more stringent set of rules to apply to the provision of services for sectoral regimes . #% There is no room for complacency when it comes to the issue of combating HIV and AIDS . #% This will be a unique sporting and cultural experience for the athletes taking part , from 160 international delegations all over the world . #% There will always be demand for live cattle exports . #% I congratulate the rapporteur on this fine report . #% The operation of this sector can be carefully monitored through appropriate national legislation . #% Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings . #% As the UN General Assembly said today when adopting its declaration against the cloning of human beings , measures need to be taken to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life sciences . #% It is unacceptable that these animals are raced to death in places such as Spain and kept in appalling conditions . #% Self-regulation or co-regulation ? #% Therefore , for their sake , throughout the Community -- not least in Ireland -- I would invite you to vote massively in favour of the report . #% Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis . #% The International Court of Justice and successive UN resolutions have made it clear that Western Sahara is Africa 's last colony , with a right to self-determination for its people . #% It is important that Mr Mather focused in his Economic Committee report on the role of enterprise in particular . #% The Irish Hotels Federation is already reporting actual losses of EUR 55 million in the last month , with obvious knock-on consequences for employment . #% We need to look at the state of stocks and what is there for fishermen . #% Finally , on the issue of third country nationals , we have a major problem throughout the European Union with this ` Fortress Europe ' mentality , keeping out the so-called non-desirables : non-whites , non-westerners or non-Christians . #% Many of these children who are not in school are working . #% Thirdly , temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity . #% 
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives . #% But , unfortunately , far too much environmental damage still occurs and we must have tough measures to make sure those who cause such damage really do pay the cost . #% Harm reduction is the thin edge of the wedge leading to legalisation . #% Mr President , the aim of the proposal is to facilitate the sale by telephone , fax and Internet of financial services such as banking , insurance , investment and mortgages while at the same time protecting the consumer from fraud , high-pressure salesmanship and certain unsolicited sales communications . #% How can people across Europe be asked to take a single market seriously if the Commission washes its hands in this way ? #% Other experiences in the Irish health system have informed my reading of this report . #% There is no demand , no logic and no justification for the liberalisation of postal services . #% Madam President , I too welcome the decision to introduce a European health insurance form card and congratulate the rapporteur for her clarity and perseverance . #% Mr President , first of all let me congratulate Mr Moscovici on his country winning Euro 2000 . #% European taxpayers do not want their money going to fund something that causes distress and harm to animals . #% That possibility is still there and we should do everything we can to put aside our relatively petty differences , based on national egotism in many cases , to reach a common position for Europe . #% Mr President , I believe it is fair to say that the meeting of the European Union Foreign Ministers in Naples last weekend was a very productive one . #% We need a balance here in protecting the consumer from the lender and the lender from the consumer . #% It can not undermine the right to private copying as provided for in the Copyright directive , and in fact reinforces that right and protects the right of privacy . #% I ask the Commissioner to clarify this situation . #% What we do not need is irresponsible misinformation and scare tactics . #% How can people take seriously the idea the EU is promoting a social Europe when this proposal drives yet another nail in its coffin ? #% If the EU has a competence , things happen . #% Saving energy is like motherhood : it is always admired but seldom supported . #% The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions , regardless of how one might feel about the issue . #% Parliament is seeking , in this debate at least , to give some guidance to the Commission as to how it should proceed with regard to services of general interest , both economic and non-economic . #% I also said that this raising of the ceiling would be accompanied by a further effort to redeploy the available appropriations within Heading 3 to help the sectors concerned , allowing an increase in the total available funds of ECU 1.2 billion . #% We have already seen what happens : schools , churches and post offices close and people move away from the countryside to the towns . #% It behoves us to take this matter seriously . #% The Western European Union is a military alliance committed to the nuclear deterrent . #% The role of legislators in this area is even greater as we in the EU and Member States can with consultation and partnership create a better and brighter future for sufferers , family and carers . #% Madam President , first of all congratulations to Mr Linkohr , not least for his persistence and his patience over the years . #% I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to look particularly at the passport decision 2000/68/EEC . #% Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000 . #% It would be very wrong if we were to suggest that there should be a tax imposed on the farmers exporting from those countries if their governments are forced to submit to a devaluation of their currency . #% The White Paper raised expectations , and we look forward to the exciting campaign for take-off with its 1 million PV systems , its large windfarm , its biomass and most exciting of all its 100 communities where all the electricity will come from renewable energy . #% Mr President , normally a scientific and technological cooperation agreement is straightforward , very welcome and an occasion for optimism , especially if it is the successor to earlier agreements on which good scientific work has been done . #% Are we now throwing in the towel ? #% Out of over 110 000 applications received at the EPO in 2001 , 16 000 dealt with inventions in computer-implemented technologies . #% Do you really think that could have happened if there had not been cooperation - not just between them , but cooperation all the way to the Far East ? #% As ever with Marxist extremists , be they Castro or Sinn Fein , they simply pocket the concessions and carry on regardless . #% I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under the framework of the United Nations . #% What is the Council 's response to the statement by President Bush that the USA has decided not to implement the Kyoto Protocol ? #% I am not sure what the implications for the industry would be if there was a system as she proposes , but I certainly will raise her concerns . #% The figures agreed will permit Ireland only to increase emissions by 13 % relative to 1990 figures . #% The report calls on the Commission to replace this non-strategy with ambitious proposals , including clear targets and binding timetables . #% I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem . #% It is very simplistic . #% Madam President , in my previous contribution to this debate , I acknowledged the importance of carefully managed genetic research and its role in meeting the challenge of world food production and maintaining the commercial viability of family farming . #% We have to recognize that as the resources of the European Community have been increased over the years a lot of bad publicity has attached itself to the administration , to the European Commission and to the institutions of the Community generally because of what was perceived as a looseness in the whole administration . #% We discover that the modest amount they have earned on these short-term schemes is also being used to keep them out of the retirement scheme . #% The basic aim of the strategy is to reduce the impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment . #% I therefore support the Commission 's proposal to submit to the Göteborg Council a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources aimed at more efficient energy use . #% They have also reaffirmed their commitment to recognise and live in peace with Israel . #% The Irish electorate has the right to know what the consequences of the Treaty are for the people of Ireland and Europe as a whole , including candidate countries . #% But there are now welcome indications that the industry has taken on board Parliament 's concern in this regard . #% The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity . #% Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government . #% But we have already committed 80 % of the budget in agriculture and structural funds . #% I believe that the inability of the European Union to react to the tragedy with the same single-mindedness as the United States , which sent its Secretary of State , is a clear indication of the urgent need for an EU foreign minister . #% However , there is a very firm majority in Parliament who are in favour of a European involvement , not just in the exchange of best practices or the cooperation procedures , which we agree with , but also in utilising some of the previous programmes which existed in the past ; in particular the Poverty I and Poverty II programmes and the way that they dealt with the problems using a bottom-up approach . #% According to the report , the two projects I have just named provide good examples of projects built to meet local needs . #% in writing . - I support this allocation of $ 14.8 million of European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGAF ) support to the 2 840 workers of Dell in Limerick who have lost their jobs following the closure of their plant because , rather than Dell , it will benefit the redundant workers directly . #% in writing . - I have spoken on this issue before and I am voting for this report because I believe EU citizens have the right to know the make-up of the clothes they buy . #% There is an imperative to continue to invest . #% Finally , I would appeal to those people who buy black-market cigarettes to remember that they are putting money into the hands of ruthless criminals who are possibly also engaged in laundering money from drugs . #% I believe that the delay , for which you are now being reproached in debates like this , is totally undignified and unwarranted , and that you and this Parliament find themselves becoming the victim as bystander of a process of an Executive outside this House . #% Each individual brand should list all additives , not just the prohibited ingredients . #% The Tories used to announce every year that they were blocking a few arms exports to ruthless regimes while at the very same time proceeding with much greater deals . #% That should be clarified . #% Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it . #% 
This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas , but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing . #% Could the Commission explain what has changed and why it does not see any illegality at the moment , whereas a year ago it seemed that the Irish Government was in breach of the common fisheries policy regulations by allowing this vessel to fish in Community waters ? #% However , while benefiting from a fall in the euro , they were turning the other cheek within days to be hit with record high oil prices . #% Madam President , it is very simple . #% I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom . #% Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans . #% I am happy that Commissioner Špidla is in the Chamber at the moment and I hope he has taken note of my remarks because they are serious : they are not made lightly . #% We need to remember that the well-established groups were once small too . #% Market support measures will be essential in providing adequate safety nets against extreme market volatility which is likely to be a feature of the market in the future . #% Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs , reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice . #% They simply have to be if animals are to arrive at their final destination in good condition - acceptable to the final recipient . #% But the choice is clear : either you support Mr Oostlander or you send out the dangerous message that heroin and synthetic drugs for personal use and distribution are acceptable . #% The Commission can be assured that my group and the Regional Affairs Committee and others will be most supportive of the proposals when they come on stream . #% In part , it has been a victim of the chaotic , undermanaged and sometimes unmanaged growth of responsibilities during the Delors years . #% This has resulted in proponents and opponents alike paying inadequate attention to the practical consequences of abolition . #% The tobacco industry and tobacco growers have to realize that they will have to turn to alternative crops . #% We enter into a social contract with our governments . #% Even though the proposed budget for the programme is lamentable - ECU 28 million over five years is entirely inadequate given the scale of the problem - it is evidence of the recognition of the need for concerted action at European level . #% All four objectives are important and I congratulate the European Commission on its intention to establish coordinating measures . #% I agree with several things in the report . #% Here is a situation within the European Union that has been going on for a long time . #% Why were we testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific last year ? #% In the meantime , I have not altered my view other than to say , regretfully , that the dreaded virus has since spread to my country with devastating consequences for farmers within the control zone of Cooley Peninsula , and with worrying implications for Ireland 's farming and rural communities . #% I regret that the issue of arms exports has not been seriously addressed in the Rocard report . #% What we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis . #% They must also obviously be allowed fair access to the media . #% This directive will clarify the reimbursement of costs for treatments that patients have received in another Member State and will ensure the good functioning and the financial balance of national health systems . #% This CCCCTB proposal clearly sets out the path to tax harmonisation , that great but mostly unspoken threat to Irish prosperity . #% If stocks are to recover then the juveniles have to be allowed to mature and develop if the industry is to recover . #% Those who are more at home with the cosy familiarity of their own tribe , on both sides , must choose a more open and pluralist alternative . #% While this is to be welcomed , it means very little for millions of people throughout the European Union . #% We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant . #% We know how you cut apart pieces of metal and how you transport them ; but we do not have a publicly-acceptable solution to what happens to the radioactive part of nuclear power stations . #% It is totally unacceptable that vessels in the Mediterranean are exempt from the obligation to keep logs and declarations of catch in contrast to the requirements placed on vessels in other EU waters . #% As regards animals not being traced , I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on greyhound breeding and the export of greyhounds . #% Technology , telecommunications and transport have made the world a much smaller place . #% However , the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures . #% However , on the general issue of aid , it is important to point out that , although the total aid from the international community may seem enormous when compared to other areas in crisis , Afghanistan is at the bottom of the pile when we look at aid given per capita . #% The recent information about the falsification of documents just added to the deep sense of unease that is shared by people throughout our island . #% In particular I refer to Zimbabwe . #% The Bible as always is right when it states that there is a giving which does not impoverish . #% Not allowing Taiwan to join the World Health Organisation -- how sad is that ? #% What is not so readily acknowledged is that it has also been a successful prosperity process . #% I am delighted to support this report which will benefit us all . #% The European Union and national Member States must implement programmes which take account of the ever-changing nature of employment , both in urban and rural areas . #% Madam President , the common agricultural policy was to remain central to the medium - and long-term planning of European agriculture . #% I would just like to point out that Mr Titley himself has a lot of questions to answer . #% In some ways this Commission communication has been overtaken by events and I am delighted to see that in the General Affairs Council this week there has been a victory for common sense . #% Not for the first time , the EU is being taken for a ride . #% Please ensure that energy efficiency becomes a key national indicator at Barcelona . #% They have largely been treated - I regret to say - with indifference and indeed , very often with contempt . #% It is typical of the man that he died trying to fulfil his mission of peace . #% In conclusion , it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam . #% In that context I would like to make some very brief points . #% We should hang our heads in shame that we have more legislation on the books of the European Union relating to animal welfare than we have relating to the welfare of children . #% It is clear that there will be a cap on budgetary contributions . #% . It was my predecessor , Philip Whitehead , who tabled this question on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and I know that he would have wanted to ensure that we support the SOLVIT system and encourage the Commission to refine and develop the problem-solving network on behalf of EU citizens and consumers . #% This EP resolution follows a series of worrying events such as the adoption of the Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effects of Public Information , the attempted prohibition by local authorities on holding equality and gay pride marches , and the use by leading politicians and parliamentarians of inflammatory or threatening language and hate speech . #% Respecting your request , I understand that the Commission is undertaking a report on commercial and retail activities in US airports . #% One of the things that I miss from the information we were given is the cost of this operation or what the cost would be if every Member State involved themselves in it . #% Lets recognise that a debt moratorium for indebted countries will not do half enough to allow them rebuild their battered communities . #% In conclusion , it is about time that these directives were brought together , that the texts were clarified and that greater certainty was put into the legislative framework under which people have to operate . #% We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle . #% Unfortunately no technology can replace the driver 's fundamental responsibility to drive safely and adhere to the rules of the road . #% It is a major issue , along with exotic diseases and imports of diseases and problems . #% That is why I voted against the Rothley report . #% 
A qualified doctor tried for a number of years to register as a doctor in Spain . #% The response to climate change lies in strong international governance and financial commitment . #% For road transport we will now have three categories of operators , own-account , third party hauliers and self-employed with three different working time regimes under Directive 93/104 . #% I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report . #% Above all it needs monitoring . #% We know only too well that major environmental disasters respect no international frontiers . #% As it stands in our resolution , therefore , it may not make sense . #% Firstly , in the State of the Union address that President George Bush gave in January of this year , he committed , and the Congress approved some time afterwards , USD 7.8 billion to be put aside over the next ten years for research into hydrogen cell-fuelled automobiles . #% Unless the finances are provided , that Pact will , regrettably , still be left hanging . #% I believe that this directive is an own goal . #% Iceland can export fisheries produce to the EU tariff-free . #% Will the presidency back Parliament 's demands in the Council for a strengthened partnership pact , and what concrete and practical actions will the presidency take to ensure that partnership is not just an optional extra but an integral component of all programmes , strengthening the cohesion of a People 's Europe ? #% That is not the answer for those countries . #% Surely the way forward is the closest possible cooperation between the European nations , not the incorporation of those nations in a European superstate . #% in writing . - Promoting labour standards through the EU 's negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries . #% We must encourage an emotional environment that is conducive to having children . #% I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but , as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said , they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges . #% The scandalous exploitation of young African footballers is a problem which I would ask you to look at again , because it does not seem to me to be addressed by the ban on inter-club transfers . #% When we speak about Plan D for democracy and so on and we put forward these plans , they must be based on what people want . #% Mr President , you rightly say that the question of language should be dealt with by the Council with regard to what is and is not appropriate . #% Some are not even designed with those who are in real need in mind . #% I come from a State that is non-nuclear and against electricity being generated from nuclear power . #% I can understand Mr Lechner 's frustration as he and some of the members of his group worked closely with industry to try and frustrate this resolution , but we can not have the politics of the press release overturning decisions of this House . #% Mr President , I am very happy to add my voice to those who support the concept of voluntary citizen participation in the work of community development . #% Not only is it a nonsense , it is a scandalous nonsense . #% It is also essential that we look at new models and new ways of training , and that we create this synergy between the employers , the trade unions and the unemployed themselves to develop the best models for coping for them . #% Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen ? #% The EU got nothing that matters in return for its commitment to eliminate export subsidies by 2013 . #% Let me say to the President-in-Office that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well , and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda 2000 which are now more essential than ever . #% Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency . #% It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement . #% Unfortunately , he paid a high price for his noble and unselfish involvement in the Burundi conflict when he was murdered by rebel groups on 29 December 2003 . #% Mary Robinson , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against sanctions for a long time . #% There are a lot of covert subsidies to the nuclear sector that have been there for a long time and that are long overdue for a considerable review if not a total ban . #% At the end of the day what we need is a long-term programme - seven or ten years - with a bottom line that tells us what we can expect to achieve in the end and , in the meantime , the investment necessary . #% The oral question this morning raises an excellent point about the hypocrisy and inequity of the Western world demanding materials for vaccines from developing countries to protect their rich citizens , and then having the audacity to sell the selfsame vaccines back to the poor . #% This situation has to be addressed . #% The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive . #% But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depositories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve . #% Hundreds of Palestinians have been left homeless as a result of the demolition of nearly 100 houses by the Israeli forces at the refugee camp in the Gaza Strip . #% Instead of harassing Father Cullen , the Filipino authorities should welcome the work that he has been doing in their country . #% Revelations followed daily and the local authority had a heated and intense discussion on this question yesterday . #% We should also recall that we have worked very closely together in the battle against international terrorism . #% For example , our collective economies are only achieving moderate success at this particular time . #% Another point I want to make , as previous speakers have and , I suspect , most of the following speakers will , concerns the importance of this and other fisheries agreements to certain regions of the Community which are heavily dependent upon fishing . #% I would prefer to take this money and spend it in the regions concerned , in Spain , Portugal or France , and spend it in such a way that we have direct control over the development we promote and in a way that we could be sure would be sustainable - for fish farming or alternative industries , perhaps . #% I would have agreed with the US and would rather have seen a two-thirds majority for that purpose . #% UNIFIL II must also ensure that further arms are not smuggled into Lebanon to rearm any groups and that Lebanon 's sovereignty is respected at all times . #% I do not feel that harmonisation of fuel taxes has an essential part to play . #% It is all or nothing in terms of your new college . #% I endorse the proposal to establish a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships as it takes on board many of Parliament 's proposals . #% Rather than being bogged down in mere politics , let us look to the bigger picture . #% I hope we will hear more about this shortly from the Commission . #% Despite its high economic costs , its failure to deal with radioactive waste and the need for very high safety and security standards , ` stupid ' energy would insist on the promulgation of nuclear power , even in countries at very high risk of nuclear weapons proliferation . #% However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously . #% I deplore and regret the Commission 's breach of good faith . #% If you have no competition , you will have no service innovation , but if you have cut-throat competition , you will not have service innovation either . #% That is better late than never . #% Once again , we must point the finger at China as the main supporter of the Government in Khartoum . #% This is a big task but it can be done . #% Another concern for me are the amendments which were passed in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development calling for the reintroduction of the marketing standards of fruit and vegetables , which some MEPs are desperately trying to get back on the table . #% It is very important that the European Union and Yugoslavia normalise diplomatic relations . #% I should like to speak in particular about the social fund regulations and thank Mrs Jöns for her very visionary and forward-looking report . #% As regards GMOs and plant genetics , the proposals that were adopted in committee would put genetically-modified foods on our table and will be forced on European consumers , quite contrary to what many want . #% I am wondering if there is any further action . #% However , despite repeated requests , Commission officials have so far failed to provide a copy of this document . #% 
In my own country , Ireland , there has been an almost 20 % drop in farm incomes this year when inflation is factored in . #% If we can not be sure that fish are available these particular species should not be put in the agreement . #% It needs to be demonstrated that this is the case , because this will help to ensure the added value I spoke of . #% In February Mr Hans von Sponek , the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq , followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people . #% These distinctions are important and , in particular , we must ensure the continued free service for those who most need it . #% I want to make it very clear . #% No good ever comes from pandering to terrorists or their political apologists and I hope that Israel , the EU and Mr Solana will not waver in following such a line and that they will not waver in insisting that the only way forward is for Hamas to give up violence and recognise Israel . #% However , from what we see from some of the people proposing some of the amendments and from some of the lobbying that has taken place on this issue , they simply want a free-for-all : no protection within the European Union , and what would that lead to ? #% Mr President , we all know that counterfeiting and product piracy has reached epidemic proportions . #% We want to see independence for the people of East Timor , which is their democratic right . #% The Portuguese Presidency will organise a Social Affairs Council which we can engage with if we deliver a view . #% We need to have partnership . #% In relation to business directories - where companies , individuals , schools , have been trapped into paying money to companies that publish names and then require payment , where people initially did not believe payment was necessary , or indeed required , or worse still , where people did not want the service at all - we are still inundated by individuals who are trapped and feel powerless to resist the pressures of these unscrupulous business directory companies . #% One of the most important aspects of this directive is that it will restore confidence in blood transfusion services generally and in the movement of blood and blood products throughout the European Union so we can all have confidence in other Member State systems in relation to it . #% Basically , Ireland is very ill equipped for dealing with major accidents in the chemicals industry . #% We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long-term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO2 and its impact on the environment . #% A compromise has been reached between the institutions at a recent Conciliation Committee meeting which was held last March . #% First of all , most of the investment in Ireland is in entirely new projects and does not involve the relocation of jobs . #% I sympathise with the Commission . #% Mr President , I contest the European Court of Justice decision to annul the second sentence of Article 5 of the working time directive , which specifies Sunday as a rest day . #% I believe , as does the Committee on Fisheries , that it is important for Community fishermen that this agreement be renewed after 31 December of this year when the current prolongation expires . #% Public information campaigns must be supported both within Ireland and the European Union , because prevention is the best cure in such matters . #% Irish defence forces serving overseas require United Nations approval , the agreement of the Irish Government and the approval of the Irish Parliament . #% Rather than reinventing the wheel and coming up with new ideas , we should reinvigorate the whole idea of the roadmap that was agreed between the EU , the United Nations , the US and Russia . #% I think this is a major cause for concern , since the regulators have miscalculated . #% I am voting against this recommendation/common position because I believe it does not adequately address the technical issues involved . #% Indeed , as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Parliament has the power of codecision with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations in the area of consumer protection and public health . #% Mr President , I would like to propose an oral amendment to Amendment No 22 to include the words ` in addition to the North Sea and the Irish Sea ' . #% Patent protection must be excluded from such experimentation . #% Mr President , from an agricultural and rural development perspective , the delivery of EU policy objectives , taken in tandem with the most recent CAP reform , means that EU farmers can now plan to meet the challenging agenda of food security , quality and high environmental standards . #% It is quite clear that tobacco advertising has an appalling effect on young people in particular . #% The EU must aim to be an example of the well off always willing to give a hand-up to those less advantaged then ourselves . #% Finally , I should like to ask the Commissioner whether there will be another proposal from the Commission with regard to copyright and related rights in the information society in the near future ? #% We need an intergovernmental agreement which gives us something similar in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency . #% I believe that there is a role for the Commission in dealing with this sensitive issue and that this energy matter is best coordinated at European Union level in the interests of European industry and the citizens of the European Union . #% But the single market on its own is not enough . #% We want to see the creation of a European rating system for child-friendly Internet providers and the display of child safety messages . #% Nowadays we often hear the claim that the world is at your fingertips : one click and you have access to the whole world . #% There must be fair fishing grounds with all parties committed and forced to comply with the rules . #% Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Wiebenga . #% It provides an example and a message to other countries in the region which have very inferior human rights records and no respect for democratic methods . #% There are those in this House , and indeed within the administration , who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe . #% Therefore , mandatory data collection on the impact of economic activities by Member States is necessary . #% Another issue raised once again is the easy option : blame the CAP - as if the CAP were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world . #% A policy of strategic ring-vaccination around outbreaks may be appropriate in certain circumstances even though we still can not distinguish commercially between infected and vaccinated animals . #% Some EU countries are more exposed than others - Germany probably more than anyone else ; but even we in Ireland are not unaffected . #% Let us all work together for the benefit of those people and hopefully other parts of this continent would look towards Northern Ireland and strive to resolve their problems in a similar way . #% We ought therefore in future to either provide the money and the conditions under which it is paid or cease to ask the Commission to give assistance . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round , which is not always the case . #% My biggest fear arising from the failure of the Hampton Court summit and a lacklustre British Presidency is that it will make my government over-eager to secure a face-saving deal on the budget in December and that , as a result , Mr Blair will concede far too much on the British rebate , just so it can be said that something was achieved by the British Presidency -- that is to say something other than ensuring EU bankruptcy by opening the door to Turkish accession . #% An opinion , Commissioner , rather than a recommendation . #% However , some people at the EU Convention are rushing ahead with extensive reform in all matters connected with the day-to-day operation of the Union . #% I am delighted to hear so many references here today to the Cork Declaration . #% Firstly , it does not start on time . #% The conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo and elsewhere led to sudden large population movements and the need for temporary protection . #% The Commission , Parliament and the EU governments must substantially increase the financial budget for public health campaigns which highlight to teenagers the real dangers of smoking . #% The lack of a clear legal base in the Treaty has meant that children ' s specific needs are ignored . #% If a consumer decides to avoid such products , that is his or her right . #% Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers . #% Mr President , I have here today as my guest , and as the guest of many Members , the Dairy Trade Coalition from the United States of America . #% In relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere . #% There is , however , one important bridge to be crossed if this desired objective is to be achieved . #% We must set common policy objectives together and face the key challenges which lie ahead for the European Union within a united and unified framework . #% The report from the Committee of Inquiry incorporates a number of amendments which I tabled because I believe that BSE spread outside Britain mainly through exports of contaminated meat and bonemeal . #% I hope that the Commission can accept the rapporteur 's amendments , which improve the Commission 's proposal . #% In my country , it takes the Department of Agriculture five years from the time that you actually make an application until you are registered . #% 
I need answers for the people of Watergrass Hill , Glenville and other towns : the people who are struggling with life in shiny new clusters of houses with no soul . #% The Council of Europe , in its report Coherent and Integrated Family Policies , states , `` Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values , standards , customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong '' . #% It is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to SAVE II . #% Many voluntary groups concerned about the material which is undoubtedly appearing and , as Carole Tongue has rightly said , is very easily accessible need to go back to some of the most simple rules when , whether you can understand it or not , you try to accompany your children on some of their journeys into cyberspace . #% I fully support the budget increase . #% When people speak about ensuring that other people can use software patents , they seem to think that everybody can come up with these ideas themselves and do not need any protection or grounding in those ideas . #% This has been justified very clearly in the report . #% I do not know whether an air strike can take out all these weapons , but for us to start again without finishing would be disastrous . #% But can he tell me whether the Member States along the route have actually given permission for this transit ? #% For those of us who feel forced to stand and watch helplessly , Pope John Paul II , one of the world 's greatest leaders , who has consistently reached out to the Muslim community , has asked us to fast and pray for a speedy end to this war . #% in writing . - I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers . #% This is about Brazilian beef coming into Europe . #% The euro will , hopefully , become a symbol of our interdependence and an incentive to the states of the European Union towards further cooperation . #% If not , then it will have to relocate to a place where it can do so and be more efficient . #% I am very shocked that my own government has made several attempts to water down EU proposals to regulate emissions of electromagnetic radiation from mobile home masts . #% Their priorities are many but there is no doubt of the one area that we all agree on is for the need to create jobs . #% Sadly , stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily , for reasons of image . #% Some people have decided to create the impression that this is an issue pitching the large multinationals against small SMEs . #% The principles at the heart of the European Union can therefore solve conflict anywhere in the world because those three principles are also at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland . #% It is based on respect for people with different ideas and focuses on ways to work together . #% I will send the details of these cases individually to the Presidency . #% In this particular instance the UK Treasury was directly responsible for regulating Equitable Life and it would have been faced with claims for billions of pounds sterling had it found that Equitable Life should close down . #% Madam President , today 's debate is welcome , necessary and timely . #% I would be inclined to say to the Commissioner that , no matter what you call it or how you achieve it , what you should do is to take the problem , give it a good shaking , get on with it and to try and force Member States to bring about the result everyone agrees is required and sort out how it will really affect the industry . #% Our aim in this context must be to maximise Ireland 's share of the structural funds . #% General de Gaulle dreamed of a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals . #% Mr President , it is clear that vaccination works and it is clear that we have a responsibility to the people who are suffering from the absence of vaccinations . #% That also applies to the Azores , I am sure , and to Ireland , though the Azores ' waters are not so rich . #% In seeking to enhance the international role of the Central Bank my group also expects from the bank itself greater transparency in its policy formulation . #% We do that by a series of moves , through legislation and other areas , to ensure that the common good and individual rights are protected . #% For example , from an Irish perspective , I have some concerns relating to a number of issues . #% To date , we have not been able , as has already been said , to develop a marker vaccine capable of controlling the disease . #% This is serious business and EU governments must look closely at the different options available to us . #% There is great merit in the rapporteur 's suggestion that household catering waste be exempt from the provisions of these regulations with regard to transport , identification etc and that they be covered by national rules and the Framework Directive on Waste . #% The European Union is footing that particular bill . #% However , as those speakers have mentioned , very little progress has been made on this , partially because of the unanimity requirement under Article 99 but also because of a lack of action on behalf of the Commission and other institutions to force out the boat with regard to giving proper representation to the true ideals of the single market . #% In relation to historical waste , that is particularly important in countries like my own where mining activities are not as prolific as they have been in the past . #% We in the European Parliament are very much for freedom of speech and freedom of information but we are even more concerned to protect children against criminal and violent abuse . #% However , two weeks ago Parliament said ` no ' to a framework directive . #% My final political comment , in general terms , with regard to the upcoming Vienna Summit , is that this will afford an opportunity to review the claims of other applicant states . #% Mr President , this new directive outlaws tobacco advertising in the printed media in the whole of Europe and will also prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on radio and on the internet . #% We then should allow Member States to establish threshold values for a range of other substances . #% Mr President , medicinal products are something quite ordinary and everyday . #% We note the assurances given by the Turkish authorities that they intend to pursue the process of constitutional and legislative reform , and we are continuing to press them to go down that road . #% But we also hear of new fears , because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban . #% The title was changed from ` The Declaration on Climate Change ' to ` Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability ' . #% I say ` excessive ' caution . #% You certainly played your part , following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr Hänsch in ensuring that we could , at this particular time , be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could withstand the criticisms and cynicisms that were going to be directed at us . #% Any kind of advertising which promotes something that is a danger to health must be unacceptable in a civilized society . #% Nevertheless , I question the meaning of the discharge and how useful it is as a tool , two years after the event and where , as in this case , management and personnel may well have changed . #% On the key issue of funding of the agricultural fund for European development , I have some misgivings , because unless there is unanimous agreement in Council on the financial prospectus for the period 2007 to 2013 , this whole project could find itself in limbo land . #% in writing . - I support this piece of legislation regulating hedge funds and private equity . #% I would like to think that in May we could give you a political mandate to act as formateur , to go from this House in May to begin to explore in substance , as formateur with a political mandate , what you might do . #% Some progress has been made and we are still a long way from achieving the agreed targets . #% We could have had a decent common fisheries policy without taking fish into common ownership . #% As Mrs Lynne has already said , it is not acceptable that the aid workers do not have access to the camps where people are dying . #% Everyone should respect international covenants on human rights and each Member State in the European Union has serious questions to answer as regards the application of law . #% Foreign armies must be withdrawn and such wealth as exists in Afghanistan should be taken from the hands of the Karzai government , corrupt landlords and warlords and put democratically in the hands of organisations of peasants , workers and the poor to really utilise those resources and develop them for the benefit of the people . #% This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy . #% This will allow progress to be made on the matter in 2004 . #% Only the roadmap provides the basis on which progress can be made towards a just and lasting two-state solution . #% Mr President , I want to say to the Commission that , in my view , any talk of imposition of sanctions on the peoples of the Indian sub-continent in response to the recent testing of nuclear weapons would be wrong . #% Secondly , dealing with special facilities for the elderly population , particularly in this year , the International Year of the Elderly . #% Countless women die giving birth every year . #% It has come to my attention that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has applied to the British Department of the Environment for authorisation to discharge high levels of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea in the near future . #% Unless we can control organized crime - international organized crime , particularly - we will find that these policies will become more and more restrictive . #% 
An atrocity or a tragedy on the European continent is commemorated in the history books for every single day going back over 227 years . #% The Union can not become the most knowledge-based economy in the world unless it takes full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies . #% It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly . #% Since aftercare is an important part of the directive , it is essential that these sites due to be closed come under the directive . #% This House does not appear to read its own documents . #% I would like to concentrate on one point that concerns me greatly and that is the future availability of veterinary resources , particularly in remote regions of the European Union . #% The problem now is the lack of clarity regarding state aid for regional airports in Europe . #% Could I also suggest that they might consider using the Treaty of Nice provision which allows for decisions of this nature to be taken by QMV rather than unanimity . #% Our citizens have challenged us in the field of food production to safe food , with the guarantee of adequate precautions to ensure this goal and proper liability and penalties in place for any violation resulting in damage to the person on the environment . #% We must show leadership as must the media , educational institutions and the churches ; they have not shown such leadership in the past . #% Mr President , I am very disappointed at the outcome of the original Ó Neachtain/Stevenson report because of the adoption of Amendment No 20 . #% One of the difficulties we face in our discussions is the justifiable desire to ensure that the press and media in Europe have freedom of expression , the freedom to poke fun , the freedom to satirise , the freedom , in some cases , to insult people . #% I would also agree with Mrs Hermange who rightly pointed out that , up to very recently , children could not even be mentioned in this House . #% Renationalising part of the CAP could only have led to the ultimate disintegration and fragmentation of the common agricultural policy itself . #% Madam President , firstly , I wish the Swedish Presidency every success in the knowledge that their success will certainly be Europe 's success as well . #% I will defend the Irish constitution against usurpation . #% The system would enable citizens of the Community and others to have prompt and easy access to authoritative and up-to-date information in relation to the existence and progress of trans-border litigation in which they may have a legitimate interest . #% I am quite happy to engage in debate with the minister but the problem is that , in adopting that attitude and in adopting that frame of reference for this debate , he is feeding the paranoia which is at the root of much of the abuse that immigrants and refugees face in their host country . #% When he was Ireland 's Minister for Finance in 1991 he joined other EU finance ministers in agreeing that duty-free sales should cease by the end of the decade . #% It is up to the Member States to deal with violence , whatever its origins or intent . #% In terms of the standards and ethics expected of democratic parties I very much regret that in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party has seen fit to invite into its Stormont Assembly Party the political representative of the UVF , an illegal organisation which has been mired in racist , sectarian and other violence . #% in writing . - The Commission 's proposal for a Small Business Act is part of a communication containing legislative proposals , guiding principles and measures to be implemented to help SMEs in Europe . #% I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group . #% Irish and European passengers deserve to know that their basic civil liberties will not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office whether he perceives the role of family farming as representing the backbone of the rural economy . #% Sixty-eight per cent of EU employment and over 60 % of wealth creation comes from the services sector and , therefore , services are the key driver for the sluggish EU economy . #% The real difficulties will arise within the framework of the final status negotiations , which includes the contentious issue of Jerusalem , control over water rights and the return of refugees . #% This aspect of the fisheries sector is the poor relation that has been ignored for far too long . #% It needs to be made much more effective : we need systematic compilation on the illegal wildlife trade to determine the numbers of seizures and confiscations . #% The fact that she has not been seen and that her whereabouts is unknown raises serious concerns about whether she is alive and what kind of condition she is in . #% I am disturbed that the Commissioner shows more concern for trade liberalisation than good farming practice . #% They need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to Belfast to reach airports and everywhere else . #% The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags ; they turn a blind eye and do not care . #% In the case of Ireland , for example , asset inflation , the price index for houses , went up 1.5 % in February . #% The EU Commission had originally proposed stipulating a minimum distance of 0.5 km from the site boundary to residential areas but the Council of Ministers deleted this from the text of the draft directive . #% We have to face the reality that this is going to be extremely difficult to achieve . #% In supporting this report , I commend to members the points concerning the role of organisations dealing with disabilities and other NGOs who have been powerful advocates on their behalf , and who have listened to the voices of the people and who grasp the opportunity to change the world for the better for all of us . #% I particularly welcome this report and its emphasis on the regional administration of the structural funds . #% In 1962 they owed $ 3 billion , whereas it is now in the region of $ 235 billion - equivalent to 76 % of GNP . #% Having visited Iran with a delegation from this Parliament I am keenly aware on the dire needs of the population there . #% This is our duty , a duty which , last week , the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to . #% For some time now this institution has been under hostile attack in some Member States - not on the basis of policies which Parliament is pursuing , but rather in the form of outlandish insinuations about the internal administration of Parliament . #% Dismissing Parliament 's concerns of will not work , Commissioner De Gucht , and I would urge you to consult us more if you wish to have any potential agreement signed off by Parliament . #% On the basis that the sector is likely to enjoy budget stability until 2013 , we must use this time to initiate practical research as to how best to achieve this objective . #% It is clear that natural hazards pose a global threat and warrant global responses . #% The old saying ` give a man a fish , you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish , you feed him for life ' is a very wise one . #% Sunday as a weekly day of rest is a tradition to which the vast majority of the people of Europe are attached , and it adds to the social and cultural aspects of our life for most of the people of the European Union . #% We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of adversity . #% The necessity now , with the advance of technology , in particular the information society , is to upgrade people 's skills , to give new skills to people presently in work , to give extra skills to those who are unemployed and who need to get into new types of work and also to have less regulation on the labour market to allow more flexible access to training . #% That means that this particular recommendation should not yet be linked to the health programmes but should be considered alongside them . #% It is crucial to remember that all drivers , employed or self-employed , come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time , their break times and their rest periods . #% The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on . #% For instance , in Ireland 98 % of what is manufactured is transported by road . #% Violence against women exists everywhere and among all classes , rich and poor , educated and uneducated , the socially mobile and the marginalised , but a widespread and structural blindness to this problem has persisted . #% I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed . #% We also call on the non-nuclear weapons members of the NPT to fulfil their treaty commitments , i.e. not to receive , manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . #% I must say I am concerned that there will not be sufficient funds to achieve a positive outcome to sustain the future under the second pillar . #% The overall aim of the report is to raise awareness with regard to health and safety and to prevent unfair competition . #% This is of particular importance in rural areas , where numbers are declining in the traditional activities of agriculture and fishing . #% It seems like farmers are the first victims of trade deals but the first to be blamed when trade deals do not work . #% Above and beyond the need for the developing world to have similar access to flu vaccinations , we must strive to set up a system whereby the poorest people of the world , who are almost invariably more exposed to disease , have the opportunity which we in the West take for granted to protect themselves from preventable diseases . #% Ireland is much more energy efficient than it was a decade ago . #% We have grasped the need to rectify our lack - by means of patent protection , mapping of areas of excellence , tax incentives for research and development , an electronic network for scientists and enhanced mobility for our researchers . #% It is a very depressing feature of the availability of cheaper cigarettes that it encourages young people to smoke - and especially young females now who are beginning to smoke . #% Because issues such as caring in the home , violence in the home , trafficking of women and many other issues that are seen as women 's issues are not just women 's issues , they are societal issues . #% Mr President , I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on her work on this report and in endorsing the majority of the proposals within it . #% 
Mr President , the main focus of the report is on the benefit of nanoscience and nanotechnologies and the need for Europe to be at the forefront of their development , in line with the Lisbon objectives of greater productivity and economic growth . #% During our visit we visited the Claremont coffee estate , where 50 families who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations , living in what can only be described as feudal conditions , were thrown off their farm because the owner , who happens to be the sister-in-law of the country 's president , decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing . #% As such , they recommended that the product was suitable for release . #% The question is , how do we do that ? #% The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include , or exclude , self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive . #% The only solution is to put in place a proper United Nations force with a very clear mandate . #% I would also be interested if Sir Leon could tell us why it is considered necessary to register some of the Palestinian produce as being Israeli in order to facilitate its export to European markets . #% It preserves the wording of the architects directive , which is part of the , and would ensure continuity of understanding in the way this provision is interpreted under the new system . #% in writing . - This draft resolution calls for the strengthening of safety and security standards on EU oil platforms and an EU capacity disaster response in the event of an oil spill in EU waters . #% We had guaranteed these people that if they exercised their democratic rights and voted we would protect them and see it out to the end . #% Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 . #% Mr President , I yield to the temptation to borrow a phrase from Sir Christopher Wren on this occasion : ' Si monumentum requieres , circumspice ' . #% I would like to ask what competence Members think we have to condemn another sovereign nation because its country refuses to fund projects it disagrees with . #% The consumer is already faced with fragmented regulations and enforcement . #% Secondly , it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries , including flags of convenience , and there are still no controls in place to prevent this . #% Let us get rid of protectionism , but protect consumers and working rights . #% The organisation of health care systems , their funding and planning are , of course , matters for the Member States . #% One thing this highlights is that great results can be achieved when the EU institutions pool their collective intelligence . #% I am becoming attracted to trading as a way of meeting our needs . #% Could the Commission confirm that the same security standards that are now deemed necessary in Cap de la Hague - that is protection with fighter planes and ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone - are in place in Sellafield ? #% However , I have many reservations . #% Mr President , I should like to thank and congratulate all the rapporteurs . #% We must never forget that terrorism is rooted in poverty and social exclusion and , as we discuss the economic governance of the EU at the spring summit , we must realise that our economic growth depends on peace and stability which , in turn , depend on our efforts to ensure economic stability and growth in those parts of the world where poverty and social exclusion are the norm for millions of young men and women . #% Mr President , five years into Lisbon , in Ireland -- and , I wonder , where else ? -- poverty , discrimination and homelessness are alive and well . #% It is important to retain the current quota management system and I do not support mandatory privatisation of quotas . #% In conclusion , the CAP reform proposals are unacceptable to Ireland because they are not balanced , they do not protect the interests of Irish farming and they do not enhance rural development . #% I call on the Commission to state clearly that it will not tolerate such pressure and that it will rigorously defend the existing agreement . #% I would be very interested in that reply . #% The EU development budget in the next financial framework should increase in real terms and thus contribute to reaching the collective target of spending 0.7 % of GNI on ODA . #% . In the Working Time Report and every work related report , I look to see if the largest work force in Europe , home carers are included . #% In the meantime we hope that the Commission will bring about an in-depth evaluation of the criteria that it uses for the macro-financial assistance and we must do our part . #% The solution to this horrific 20-day bombing campaign will obviously involve negotiation . #% Everyone tells us that with Solvency II life will be great in the future , but it will not be unless we get the regulations right . #% The Commission must help : please , facilitate the transfer of best practice among Member States and also ensure that minimum energy-performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences . #% Tourism has the capacity to provide employment and generate economic activity in its own region and for its own region . #% I hope the Commission is as concerned about this as Members of Parliament are . #% The money is actually transferred and , regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not , the countries become the better off . #% Satellite and cable television have ensured that . #% I want to compliment him on the wonderful work he has done to help the disabled since he came into office and also on the recent statement in Mayo concerning the funds that should and could be spent by national governments for the disabled . #% Radioactivity poses grave dangers to health and the environment . #% In another stand-off in Bantry , County Cork , people are camping out at strategic positions , blocking workers sent to run unnecessary over-the-ground high-voltage power lines across their farms . #% Firstly , the Irish presidency was entrusted with the task of producing a draft treaty to replace Maastricht . #% There is already a situation where people are dying because they are immune to antibiotics . #% The rapporteur correctly identifies the major demographic challenges that we face here in the European Union and that we will have to meet in the future . #% It is high time that the European Union took the rights of children seriously , as they constitute over 40 % of our population but have no standing or status in European policies or ideas , except in the words we use to express our will to protect them . #% SOLVIT stepped in and contacted the local German authority , which then issued her with a temporary blue disabled parking badge -- again , that was the EU delivering for citizens . #% I had a very important oral amendment to the resolution on Auschwitz . #% It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons , or their components , into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation . #% 1 January 2002 , which is not far away , is the key date for the circulation of euro notes and coins within the territories of all the EMU participating countries . #% In the era of doing less and doing it better we need instruments to help us to be better at doing our work . #% Our economies will recover , but our environment will not ... #% One of the exhibits informed me that there are 28 different soil groups all over Europe and six of these soil groups are present in Ireland . #% He had been instrumental in persuading some of the rebel groups to give up their armed struggle and had helped to secure the release of hostages last June . #% The biofuel boom several years ago , coupled with the global food crisis in 2009 , has shown us how scarce a resource food is beginning to become . #% Bearing in mind the number of times that this matter has been raised in the House by all political groups , how can the Commission possibly justify its silence and inactivity on a matter of such serious public concern ? #% As other countries are moving away from incineration , I believe that we in the European Union need to look very carefully at the way we are moving in this particular area . #% Ireland 's path to recovery is being export-led ; thus the removal of barriers entering in the EU market is crucial . #% The Treaty was fairly modest by any standards , but it was very difficult to explain the issues to the people . #% Many of the issues being debated this morning , such as immigration , temporary protection for displaced persons and the level of harmonised penalties to be imposed on carriers transporting people without the necessary documents , are bound up with this dark world of conflict and criminal opportunism . #% Finally , I do not think it is appropriate that the third sector should be included . #% As a non-aligned country , Ireland should be promoting the right of the four Member States of this Union to maintain their non-aligned status within the Union instead of toeing the EU pro-military line . #% I fully support the idea of EU assistance to the business sector in developing countries through intermediaries . #% On behalf of our Group , and Mrs Lenz who unfortunately can not be here , I rise to express our total support for this resolution . #% I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo that murder is no solution to political conflict . #% I would appeal to the Commission to use some political sagacity in its approach to this situation . #% The specific instrument for development policy is this instrument ; it will not have any other content . #% 
First of all , Question Time was put back to 6:30 p.m. , then it was announced on the screen that it would begin at 6:50 p.m. . #% This proposal would also involve information centres being set up so as to enable victims to identify appropriate claim representatives . #% The amnesty granted by King Sihanouk refers only to this conviction and makes no reference to future convictions and therefore it is important that he is tried . #% Incidentally , it is not a matter for the European Union to tell Member States whether or not it is appropriate for them to have early decommissioning of their nuclear power stations . #% Of course we all wish to thank Mr Marimón for his patience and good humour . #% May I inform the House that this is an issue which has been very strongly raised by the Danish Foreign Minister and with me personally when we had occasion to meet recently in Sweden . #% Furthermore , an effective control of the CFP would also be incomplete if no measures are taken in the marketing of sea products . #% It is clear that such individuals visit countries like the Philippines to carry out their vile practice . #% The main provisions of this directive include the following : the consumer will have a 14-day period before concluding a contract which will give that person time to compare various proposals and study the contract in detail before giving a final agreement ; the consumer will have a 14-day withdrawal period , 30 days for mortgage loans , life insurance and pensions , to renounce the contract without penalties and without giving reasons . #% My sincere thanks to the Commissioner for her reply . #% The one thing that everybody is focused on is how the repayment system works in this Parliament . #% If we are serious about bringing Europe closer to the public , to Europe 's citizens , then this is the kind of debate we need to make public in the Council . #% It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here . #% EQUAL stands for `` equality '' . #% We owe it to our consumers and businesses to make the right decision for them and ensure that any change of law affecting their rights is properly thought through . #% We should look at sign language , at Braille , at all these things that are necessary and allow them to be part of the educational curriculum in all the Member States . #% There are serious challenges facing the European Union in the field of justice and home affairs . #% There is a great need to build public trust and confidence . #% Commissioner , I am glad that in your eighth report you bring out some of your tough instruments and make it clear that you will instigate infringement proceedings against those Member States which fail to transpose . #% On 29 October the General Affairs Council agreed that the basis of the EU approach on the subject at the Singapore conference would be the following : ' The EU considers that the Singapore conference should address the following issues : the role of trade liberalization in increasing living standards worldwide and , in this context , the importance that World Trade Organization members attach to the efforts of the ILO to promote the better definition and universal observance of core labour standards . #% In the last two weeks , two former high ranking officials in Ireland 's biggest bank have been arrested in dawn raids . #% A lot of people in my own country will be very put out that technically a lot of Members voted to increase their salaries by a huge amount . #% I sincerely hope that the very helpful set of amendments proposed by the rapporteur on behalf of the committee will be taken on board . #% I would like a more consistent and caring attitude from the Commission to the future of the family farm sector . #% I have a particular point to make as we look to the future : Europe needs to look beyond its borders and to ensure that our trade policy does not conflict with public health and food safety issues . #% There is a lack of harmonization to date and Mr Mombaur is quite right to call for harmonization . #% The disparity that has been in operation for years has a practical detriment for those states that have been complying . #% Farmers also need and want clean water . #% Even if it does not cost the Community budget any money , it gives some farmers in strong currency areas payments at the expense of farmers in weak currency countries . #% For this reason , and for many years , my group has been calling for a greater involvement of fishermen in the ways the common fishery policy is run . #% We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers , who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals . #% In 1997 the Council requested an in-depth analysis of the EU third country agreements . #% But we should not just consider our need for healthcare , but the needs of those who deliver it . #% There have been so many genocides in the past 100 years and each time we say it will never happen again . #% Surely , they can all be brought into a single directive . #% Mr President , I welcome this excellent report and congratulate the rapporteur . #% We need to deal with this and should not run away from it . #% Interest rate fluctuations have meant that borrowing for business expansion or house buying has proven to be a very risky undertaking , often resulting in bankruptcy or house repossessions when interest rates have drifted above the average levels . #% The new guidelines appear to be designed specifically to accommodate the air transport of MOX fuel . #% We should also recall that America , like all EU countries , has signed up to international conventions protecting human rights and against torture . #% The Commission 's paper acknowledges that , even though standardisation of most mental health instruments has been completed through many studies , definition of mental health states is one of the most difficult tasks . #% My last point is on the question of the six-week period . #% It is a dismal record . #% One of the most striking statistics in his report -- apart from the ever rising number of complaints , which the Ombudsman quite rightly points out is not necessarily a feature of deteriorating administration -- is the fact that 75 % of the complaints received by the Ombudsman 's office did not in fact relate to his mandate . #% The second point I wish to make is in relation to the nuclear and chemical industries in Europe . #% An explicit reference to the application of ICAT rules should be included in the text of the next protocol . #% We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can . #% I am referring to the US-Mexico City policy of requiring that NGOs agree , as a condition of receiving US funds , that they should neither perform nor promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations . #% You say that the Treaty has to be ratified in accordance with the constitutional requirements of Member States . #% In essence , these declarations spell out in clear and unequivocal terms the fact that Ireland 's policy of neutrality is fully protected . #% Two questions if I may . #% However , in terms of what we must do now , the most important issue that you must address is the Intergovernmental Conference . #% In college , I took the opportunity to study several courses of their history and literature under a rabbi . #% Killing someone to take their liver for research is murder . #% I believe consumers can see the benefit of choice and competition if they can be sure that if something goes wrong they can have a speedy remedy in a local court and they do not have to chase down a bad provider to Lisbon , Paris , Warsaw or London to have their rights recognised . #% Many of our assistants are potentially vulnerable to exploitation . #% We need the extension of the time limit for proposals from Member States in relation to their disease programmes . #% I protest , and I would like you , Mr Vice-President , to pass on my protestations to the President of Parliament . #% I am now calling on the British Government to bring forward a full and comprehensive environmental impact assessment outlining the environmental risks of transporting of nuclear materials within the Irish Sea . #% No changes at present can be agreed at EU level concerning tax policies without the unanimous support of all EU Member States . #% One-third of the population has been massacred and here we are waiting for an invitation from Indonesia . #% Considering that 80 % of all British nuclear waste is held in Sellafield and that it can process 5000 tonnes of waste per year -- about one third of the world 's waste -- and considering the serious questions about safety at this plant for many years and the number of accidents that have taken place , I would like to know what guarantees the British Government can give concerned parties and the people of Ireland that the highest safety standards will be met while this plant is being operated in private hands . #% I certainly share the concerns expressed by the honourable Member . #% This is only one report of many that will deal with other issues such as the use of small amounts of mercury in the dental industry . #% Climate change policies thus need to be designed to contribute to economic growth in the developing countries . #% We hope to increase it further . #% 
Mrs Thatcher has sought through her disgraceful intervention to make this issue a political football in the United Kingdom . #% To conclude , here is a short quote , which could best be described as an ancient Irish poem . #% Therefore , the tens of thousands of Greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right . #% Mr President , the resolution that we have before us today is not intended in any way to criticise the key actors namely the Bhutanese or Nepalese Governments in the process of finding a solution for the 96 000 Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees living in the camps . #% That is why many of us went to Iraq . #% We must continue to invest in ensuring that we have an economically viable European agricultural system . #% Mr President , first I all I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their dedication and commitment . #% It augurs well for the change that we know must take place - a change that we have been hesitant to face up to for quite a considerable period of time . #% This system would also provide efficiency in obtaining and enforcing judgments within the EU . #% On this occasion it is crucial . #% I oppose the motion . #% I hope that this House will give broad support to the proposals from the Committee on Development which have been carried out in quiet disquisition but based on our experience of the negotiations we went into - and I remind the House that we merged 14 regulations into one in the DCI . #% There is a scarcity of donations in my own country and many others . #% We see the potential and the enormous contribution that China and the Chinese people can make worldwide . #% It flies in the face of economic reason and is a serious blow to the development of the low-cost airline industry in Europe . #% However , as I said , these compromise amendments are a very good step in the right direction and a clear signal that we are serious about protecting Europe 's coastal zones . #% The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products . #% We should draw some lessons from that . #% I also support the proposed directive to improve the quality of petrol and diesel fuels in Europe . #% This is also in line with the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Portugal . #% Serious questions have to be asked about the operation procedures and indeed the training provided by low cost airlines such as Ryanair , Translift and others . #% This is one of the biggest areas of concern to the ordinary man or woman in the street who is the embodiment of the European Union . #% What the Indonesian authorities are doing there has to be challenged . #% I am very unhappy that the non-take-up of funding has been a dominant theme in the media and is discrediting the good work that we do in structural funds . #% In conclusion , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs , Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro , for their excellent report . #% Following on from that , my second and final point is that if this European Union is to mean anything , if the new treaty on European Union is to mean anything , it must protect those who are most vulnerable in our society , and that is our children . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of the House a report this week that three of the world 's largest oil companies no longer directly own petrol filling stations in Northern Ireland . #% Its task is made infinitely more difficult when its main spokesman at the Convention on Europe , former Commissioner Ray MacSharry , has disappointingly made it absolutely clear that his government has drawn a line in the sand in relation to future European integration . #% According to the World Health Organisation , they are responsible for large numbers of cases of illness and even death worldwide each year , and their use has steadily risen . #% In July of this year , the IRA called on its units to dump their arms and today we have verification that those words have been translated into action . #% This attitude , I find , is appalling . #% You would think that at the end of the 20th century we should be trying to get rid of these military blocs because they are not relevant , as far as I can see . #% Mr President , on a point of order , may I just point out that the interpretation was slightly behind you with regard to taking that vote . #% This is largely a neutral proposal by the Commission , but the Committee on Agriculture has its responsibilities to farmers . #% Last year 9 500 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the region alone . #% It is for this reason that I support the payment services report by Mr Gauzès . #% It is disgraceful that there is no mechanism in place today to verify compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention . #% Jim Grant led and largely created UNICEF , the UN response to children , until he died in 1995 . #% The amendments are totally inappropriate . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election and in thanking you for your address earlier this morning . #% Could I ask those who seek to heighten fears about bioterrorism to recognise the reality of terrorism . #% This fits in with the EU action plan and the forthcoming summit in Stockholm . #% It is claimed by Sinn Féin that the murder of Robert McCartney was not politically motivated . #% It seems obvious also that people without the technical skills required to operate the technology would not only be unable to participate economically , they would be unable to participate in the democratic processes of society . #% Commissioner , I should like to know , firstly , your own directorate 's response to this type of action and , secondly , whether there are any other mechanisms , besides going through the Czech authorities , that can be utilised in future to prevent this particular instance and also similar instances which are currently threatened in Poland , Hungary and Slovenia . #% Firstly , a common consolidated tax base cuts across national sovereignty and subsidiarity . #% What are the consequences for long-term food security and quality , not to mention the role of farmers as managers of the environment ? #% Thirdly and finally , in preparing for 2003 as the International Year of the Disabled , will it also give extra support to the Special Olympics , which will take place within the European Union in 2003 ? #% I am glad that you say that it will be referred to in the Marina II study . #% I also welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in this House . #% I am quite sure that the Council will see the wisdom of these amendments and of the regular and earlier monitoring of the energy star scheme as one , but only one , component of our energy efficient action plan . #% But the support of other Member States is being put at risk by the ban imposed by the government yesterday or the day before on imports of bone-in beef and lamb , and also the failure by the authorities in Britain to keep the ports open , as is required by the operation of the single market . #% I think those of us who participate in the fisheries committee in this parliament do not always get the credit for what they achieve or indeed what the Commission achieves . #% Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual . #% This has never been more obvious than it is at present . #% The point of order I wanted to make - even though the issue is no longer relevant - is that in your interpretation of the rules , a Member need only announce his attendance and not participate at the start of a vote . #% From the outset I made it quite clear that I wanted this report to reflect the concerns of Parliament as a whole and not of any one group . #% Mr President , I do not have the rule book in front of me but I simply want to add a clarification to the statement on Northern Ireland made by Mr Allister who criticised President McAleese of the Irish Republic for remarks she made concerning the Protestant community in Northern Ireland . #% Last year , several TACs were set higher than ICES advised . #% We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive , as it were , to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be . #% I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Byrne , the Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Public Health , for his absolute determination to guarantee that European Union consumers have total confidence in all food products that are sold within the Union . #% It is a very fundamental part of the contribution I made but because of all the noise in Parliament , it was lost on that occasion . #% Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency , frankness and humanity . #% I have one area of concern in particular - and there is nothing in the report to help resolve the problem - and that is having a clear account of the illness and diseases suffered right across the European Union . #% I did not go myself , but I have had very shocking reports of it from fellow Members of this House . #% The euro currency is already an international reserve and a transaction currency . #% 
Marking symbols used on packaging to indicate in which category the waste belongs must not only be clear and easily understood but must use the same marking symbols and same colours right across the EU . #% That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each Member States drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected . #% Mr President , as I listened to Mrs Green 's speech I felt the need to apply a brief reality check to it and to the procedures of this House . #% The rule of law Sinn Féin advocates , and the IRA enforces , is a brutal regime of terror , intimidation and violence . #% It may be my last opportunity to do so publicly . #% Now he wants the European taxpayer to contribute to the arms industry . #% I tabled a question on this and it did not come up in today 's session . #% It is not a question of subsidiarity : trans-frontier pollution is a matter of concern to us all and has prompted numerous petitions . #% Enforcement of the rules is the key . #% The Irish human rights body , a government-sponsored body , has called on the Irish Government to establish a legally enforceable regime of aircraft inspections , which at the moment does not exist . #% No one has been able to agree on how you work towards their recovery , however . #% In particular we welcome the time limits introduced for the processing of applications which will ensure that the current backlog in many member states will be cleared and a fairer procedure brought into place . #% Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission ' s proposal , in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish , but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy . #% While Parliament must look at its own role very seriously , especially following the poor turnout in the recent elections in many Member States - evidence at best of disinterest but more likely cynicism and disdain by our citizens - our job today is to respond to the hearing of the Commissioners-elect and to the case put by the President-elect , Mr Prodi . #% We can expect an exponential increase as China , India and many other rapidly developing economies increase their sugar consumption from the present 10 kg per capita per annum to the European average of 35 kg per capital per annum . #% I would like , first of all , to compliment Mrs Jackson for raising this oral question . #% As Mr Prodi said here this morning , our European Union must be able to take decisions . #% In my view only nation states can and should represent their citizens in the United Nations , with each free to determine their own foreign policy . #% I am very pleased with that . #% My last point is that , when we speak about consumers , let us ensure that we speak about all of the consumers of Europe not just those in the largest urban areas . #% With Chinese arms exports - some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago - estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year , the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question . #% I believe it was a breach of his duty as a Commissioner to act in the interests of an individual businessman from his own country . #% I do not believe that the European Union should be given powers to raise taxes by means of a procedure of qualified majority voting . #% The report was amended earlier in committee and several difficulties which arose at that stage of the procedure were overcome . #% In this regard I would hope that it will give due consideration to resolving a long-time existing environmental problem of major concern to your neighbours in Ireland - the problem of continued discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield complex . #% In Europe we have difficulties concerning the operation of the Stability and Growth Pact , but we must work through them with a sense of purpose and determination . #% Employment in both the food and tourism sector is dependent on our quality image . #% Mr President , the election of Mr Adami as the new Prime Minister of Malta is going to have the effect of reactivating the application of Malta to join the European Union . #% I welcome this report . #% The European Parliament 's legal opinion stated categorically that an unevenly weighted dual legal base , as in the common position , is legally unsound and will be struck down by the ECJ . #% Mr President , first of all I should like say on behalf of my group that we are very disappointed at the failure to include in the resolution a call for all European Member States and EU applicant Member States to give their full support for the new agenda coalition resolution which is now on the table of the 55th United Nations General Assembly . #% Mr President , as the Parliament 's mediator for transnationally abducted children , I have been involved in the de Brouwer-Limet case for some time . #% Before World War II , a famous American general made this comment about possible atomic weapons : ` Atomic weapons are to an army what an elephant is to a mouse . #% Personally , I am against a federal Europe . #% We could adopt the easy way . #% Certainly she has been sick and has gone to several hospitals for treatment during this difficult time . #% There is a clear need for the Commission to step up efforts to compile comparable data on critical indicators for the follow-up to the Platform for Action , and to translate it into regular reviews of gender mainstreaming initiatives across a range of policy fields . #% I am currently preparing a formal complaint to the Irish Police based on the findings of the Goldstone report , to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider the case for prosecutions in Ireland of those responsible . #% The companies we are dealing with here are quite powerful . #% The Commission is talking about a harmonised taxation system , but wherever harmonised taxation has taken place it has been contrary to good competition , economic growth and employment growth . #% In Ireland , since May of this year , the extra cost of delayed authorisations has been EUR 23 million . #% In previous debates in Parliament I have put on record my own views in relation to biotechnology . #% The lack of childcare facilities is a very real and fundamental barrier to women taking up employment in the workplace . #% Unfortunately , the only way of controlling it , at the moment , is by large-scale slaughter of animals , many of which are free from disease . #% I want to see the Commission review the application of relative stability so as to take better account of the need for economic , social and regional cohesion . #% I am glad that my own church has a programme to that effect and is working hard on it . #% Mr President , ba mhaith liomsa i dtosac céad míle fáilte a chuir roimh Aire Gnóthai Eachtracha na hEireann chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa i maidin . #% We must not stand on the sidelines in a disjointed and idle fashion and allow Slobodan Milosevic to run rings around the 15 Member States as he has done in the past . #% The forecast by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training ( Cedefop ) of growth of 80 million new jobs by 2020 is welcome . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , can I also say I am not totally convinced by what the Commissioner told us today . #% I would like it to be on the record that while I support the overall objective of Parliament 's resolution on the Spring Summit 2006 , I do not support amendments which state that nuclear energy is a viable alternative to Europe 's current energy dependency . #% I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ? #% Instead , let us return to a bit of sanity , where we understand the value of farming , where farmers farm and are rewarded for their labours by a fair price for their produce . #% In doing that you will establish that you , Romano Prodi , come to us not as a bureaucrat , not as a technician , but as someone dedicated to European politics , as a politician , and that as a politician you will lead a strong , independent political Commission . #% Each group has its own particular concerns , but one common theme emerges : the proposed legislation does not take sufficient account of the different situations in the Member States . #% We believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion , but also where there is wrongdoing to ensure full accountability which so far , regretfully , has either been unforthcoming or begrudging . #% I found that it carries out its duties in an open , conscientious and entirely appropriate manner . #% Mr President , can I make clear that the Socialist Group wants the words `` free , fair and socially-balanced '' included . #% I hope that they are practical and achievable , as regards the various aspects in the proposal . #% We hope that now that a management regime is put in place , the Commission will act quickly to strengthen it - for instance by other means , such as much stronger technical measures and more restrictive effort controls . #% The world is proud of you and especially also , of course , this Parliament of which you are a distinguished Member . #% Yes , smoking damages health and causes major problems for the smoker and for passive smokers . #% Let us make it a general rule that all relevant EU policies will incorporate a crime prevention element . #% I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work , and also commending their work to the House , because of the cooperation that there was between the different rapporteurs . #% If anything , the European Union has proven , over its 50 years of existence , that it is the best possible peace process that can be seen , because it is based on dialogue , mutual respect , understanding , tolerance -- not acceptance -- of all different ideas . #% Citizens see what is happening . #% 
So far , we have ignored the reality that there are some parts of Europe that are not connected by a land bridge or indeed rail tunnel . #% Now we get down to the real question : what has all this work been about ; what useful purpose that can this report serve now and in the future ? #% I should also say that it is not right to try and buy success by throwing endless supplies of taxpayers ' money at European parties . #% But what does the Commission do ? #% We need the macro-economic distribution key to be resolved sooner and not later . #% However , it is true that in recent years the software and IT industries in the EU have been thriving under the current position . #% ` Deplores the fact that some mainstream parties have seen fit to give credibility and acceptance to extremist parties by entering into coalition agreements , thereby sacrificing their moral integrity for the sake of short-term political gain and expediency . ' #% I do not think that this is a good idea . #% Of course , governments and local authorities can give monies to their own cities , but there is a wider European dimension which requires extra financing at European level . #% We have just embarked on follow-up research that looks specifically at flooding . #% Mr President , I very much welcome the proposals before us today , which are clearly designed to tackle delays caused by air traffic control problems in Europe . #% I do not exaggerate . #% Mr President , I would just like to endorse everything that Mr Howitt has said . #% Mr President , on behalf of my colleagues I wish to state that we voted in favour of this resolution on the WTO on the understanding that the reference in paragraph 6 to the CAP reform relates to the 2003 CAP reforms under Commissioner Fischler . #% Eventual Turkish membership would demonstrate the ability of western democracy and culture to co-exist and fully cooperate with the Islamic world . #% Mr President , I wish to raise my concern that the Irish Government is not fully respecting the minimum legal and humanitarian standards for the reception and processing of immigrants and asylum seekers that have been established by the European Union . #% If the Structural Funds are taken out of the calculation , there was no problem with the rest of the budget . #% The agricultural budget has been given to six or seven million people out of the 400 million people in the Union . #% Mr President-in-Office , I thank your for that very detailed response . #% As regards the labelling of alcoholic beverages , my position is that consumers have a right to transparency and complete openness . #% However , what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House . #% But we have yet to establish an infrastructure to enable the Brussels Convention , as amended and extended , to benefit our EU consumer citizens and to attract inward investment . #% At present , the five larger Member States have two posts within the European Commission and there is one each for the smaller Member States . #% Those accession states themselves have contacted many of us and the leaders of many groups about the added difficulties this report is causing . #% I believe that convicted drug barons should be given a minimum forty-year jail sentence in view of the fact that the European Union does not have the death penalty . #% Applications for asylum should be looked at without undue delay . #% I believe the Treaty of Nice is a balanced agreement which guarantees the go-ahead to the enlargement process whilst at the same time protecting and promoting the entries of the smaller Member States . #% The CAP accounts for almost half of the EU budget and it is only correct that every euro spent should be accounted for . #% Ten times that number attempt suicide . #% These two processes can not be linked - it is just not acceptable . #% Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I have , as you know , used every available opportunity in this Parliament to raise the matter of the sugar industry . #% I want to begin by asking the Commissioner to indicate very clearly what the Commission 's views are on this debate , on the amendments and on what has happened in the various committees . #% Yesterday , we grieved publicly for the victims of the irresponsible and immoral war in Iraq by wearing black armbands . #% In two of the cases I have very recently heard about , the deceased had been killed under what were considered to be suspicious circumstances . #% Staying with agriculture , I share the concern of many colleagues over the proposed across-the-board reduction of EUR 275 million in agricultural spending . #% It denigrates this House and its Members when we refuse to allow people to hold opinions that we may not agree with . #% It is crucial that , in the process , human rights are respected . #% In my Member State , Ireland , there is a clear ban on any form of experimentation on human embryos or cloning . #% Mr President , I have no difficulty with the sensible exchange of information about criminal convictions between Member States , but only the politically blind could fail to recognise the proposals in the Costa report as part of the harmonisation process that is under way in the criminal justice system across Europe . #% The Irish presidency should concentrate its efforts on implementing the roadmap and ensuring that its partners in the quartet are committed to this goal . #% If you were sitting a public examination in Ireland , you might be asked to compare and contrast . #% Having lost the vote on the common organisation of the market , I logically supported the other two reports -- on direct support schemes and the temporary restructuring of the sugar industry -- in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish , EU and ACP growers . #% Can you guarantee to make available all consultations on the web so that these will be available for consultation ? #% A subsequent Israeli commission of enquiry concluded that he bore responsibility , as they put it ' having disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance ? #% While laudable , this leads to one major gap : the recommended increases in research in nanotechnologies are preceding legislation to regulate these technologies . #% For the past two weeks , Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna , flying these flags of convenience . #% As recently as October a Eurostat publication said that transport accidents and suicide were the main causes of death of women in that age group . #% The challenge is now whether some elite have the honestly and integrity to admit that the Treaty is dead . #% I would ask the Commissioner to make sure that , in her work as the lead Commissioner on this subject , she forms a team with Commissioner Papoutsis , Commissioner Kinnock and Commissioner Fischler , the Commissioners most closely concerned . #% -- Commissioner , could you address the issue of caged beds in Romania ? #% We need to avoid this for future programmes . #% As rapporteur on the DCECI , I am fully determined to continue the intensive work that has gone into it and to ensure that it is in place as a procedural regulation well before the end of the year . #% The people of Ireland are asking if this is a foretaste of what is in store for the smaller nation in post-Convention Europe . #% Given the strong ties which exist between my own Member State and India , I am naturally keen that the EU does all in its power to help India realise its enormous potential for economic development . #% Therefore , procedures to improve security standards must be put in place as a matter of urgency . #% I find it a discourtesy to colleagues . #% Mr President , as in the case of many EU harmonising proposals there is a certain simplistic and plausible appeal to mutual recognition of criminal convictions throughout the Community . #% We are not happy , as you said in your introduction , in relation to the agreement with Equatorial Guinea . #% It is vital , of course , that workers ' standards and conditions are protected and not undermined ; guarantees have to be retained that the progress made on workers ' pay and conditions over the years is not undermined in any way . #% Needless to say the EU governments negotiating this new Treaty have individual concerns and reservations relating to certain aspects of that Treaty . #% There are minimum standards but it is possible for a Member State to go beyond those standards individually . #% In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes . #% If the Irish Government is allowed to go ahead with this , how would it square with other Member States who could follow suit and do exactly the same ? #% The compromise proposed by the Irish presidency completely ignores the will of Parliament . #% Mr President , waste management is now central to achieving the highest standards of environmental protection . #% As far as Galileo is concerned , Mr President , you know more than anyone else in this House what is needed . #% 
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I am very glad that Parliament is showing such concern for the people of Tibet . #% Ireland bears witness to this fact and , despite the outcome of the Nice Treaty , Irish people readily acknowledge the benefits of our membership and also support proposals on enlargement . #% Is the President-in-Office aware that the Council can change the designation of wool as an agricultural product ? #% An enormous step forward has been taken , but we still must reach a conclusion on the text . #% As someone said , this has happened before and it should not be allowed to happen again . #% But in order to finally eradicate violence and promote peace , there must be genuine willingness to enter into dialogue and to share power , and there must be an acceptance that the past can not dictate the future . #% Mr President , citizenship and statehood go together ; hence the desire of the promoters of the European project to produce European citizenship . #% It has made a real change to real people 's lives in all of the Member States . #% Minister Roche and , indeed , the Taoiseach , have my wholehearted support in rising to the difficult task ahead of them in the months leading up to enlargement and the European elections . #% We , who share in the wonderment of our creation , must act now in the interests of mankind . #% We all know what those prisoners are suffering . #% There are a couple of things we should focus on more than we have done . #% One of these was that the tribunal should have full power to subpoena witnesses and documents , together with all the powers usually exercised by a commissioner in a public enquiry . #% What do you mean by that ? #% Security issues are always best addressed collectively . #% Mr President , it is good that we are doing something to assist the poultry industry . #% The situation in Ireland is even worse because of our high dependence on beef and sheep meat . #% Do their votes count for nothing ? #% That is why it is essential that we protect and maintain the some EUR 1.7 billion which Ireland annually receives under the CAP . #% At previous sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , when some Member States were raising China 's appalling human rights record , they were picked off one by one because of threatened trade sanctions by China . #% We need to be more market oriented to simplify the burden of regulation and also benefit from the WTO talks . #% I urge support for compromise amendment 50 , and amendment 99 dealing with CO2 emitted from the decarbonation of limestone to produce lime , which makes an important , environmentally friendly contribution to the market . #% If we believe in a social-market Europe rather than in a supermarket Europe , we should not allow Mr McCreevy near the economic levers of this Union . #% I must insist that nuclear energy is not sustainable and produces CO2 . #% Are we seriously asking the candidate countries to ratify the Accession Treaty by referenda next year only to ask them a year later to ratify another EU treaty on more changes to the day-to-day operation of the Union ? #% I ask the Prime Minister to clarify , in the light of the agreement at Helsinki , that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis . #% Sinn Féin will support any measures which contribute to the support of such islands . #% Several scientific studies on the matter have been published in recent years , however , none of them have provided clear evidence on possible effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless technology on human health . #% I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC . #% As rapporteur , I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my colleagues , especially Mrs Müller , who drafted a very useful opinion from the Environment Committee . #% The implementation of the Waste Management Act ( 1995 ) is certainly a step in the right direction . #% We have not had a party to celebrate it and like many of us it is beginning to show its age . #% With the defeated EU Constitution there is now even less justification than ever for this foolish proposal . #% Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant in the daily lives of their citizens . #% Which of us knows today what will be the crisis sectors of the future ? #% This can not be said of many of the other Member States . #% Are we seeing history repeat itself ? #% In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that , of course , needs to remain intact . #% Would the President-in-Office not agree that the situation for women in Afghanistan has not changed at all outside of Kabul ? #% Therefore I am delighted that when we look at the fifth framework programme , as we looked at the fourth , we from all those fifteen countries say : ' That is enough . #% From an Irish perspective , the influx of refugees , asylum seekers and immigrants is a relatively new experience for us as a nation . #% Madam President , today we commemorate the 25th anniversary of a horrific event in which 13 people were killed at a civil rights march in Derry in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , it is good that we have so many environmental reports here today . #% Madam President , I may be mistaken but I understood that the intention was indeed to have a resolution . #% Energy efficiency has quite rightly been called the fifth fuel . #% Mr President , everybody in this House is concerned about the human rights situation in Colombia , and the visit of the President of Colombia , Mr Uribe , gives this House the opportunity to make plain our concerns about that situation . #% We must now reflect on that decision , each and every one of us in this House and throughout the European Union . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply . #% The summit in Dublin this weekend must address the key issues confronting the Union at the present time and set down guidelines for the work of the institutions on these issues for 1997 . #% There is some indication that is changing , but Mr Chichester is right to say that unless there is openness and transparency , there will most certainly not be any sort of public confidence . #% If you push the rule of law aside and ignore it you are in effect allowing the terrorists to win on another front . #% It is of fundamental importance that the United States adheres to the principles of human rights . #% We support the flexibility amendments to send a message to the Commission that there is room for different treatment in some Member States in relation to this regime , providing that it does not come from the flat rate payment . #% Mr President , I regret the vote that took place today . #% We have to establish a system by which traceability of food , wherever it comes from , will be assured and we have to reach an understanding with our competitors in the world markets . #% Those parties who supported Nice should seek a mandate at the next general election , which will take place by June 2002 , to present a new proposal on Nice to the people before December 2002 . #% It must be said that it is typical of its grandstanding that the EU now wants to pontificate on the future of Iraq . #% In addition , efforts should now be made to refute the misleading and inaccurate arguments that are sometimes advanced by the opponents of the single currency . #% In relation to the first part of his question , the country that has not signed is Belgium . #% I therefore use this forum tonight to call on the UK Government to release sufficient funds to enable this essential work to be done , otherwise the implementation of the Nitrates Directive will be impossible . #% Instead of tattooing them , the modern-day Europe is going to identify those who make us feel uncomfortable by fingerprinting . #% I also know that the Commission is the best friend of the smaller Member States within the European Union , which can count on protection when they need it . #% Criminals often profit from illegal shipments , as traffickers involved in the scam often trick authorities by not labelling goods as electronics , by pretending they are for re-use , or by hiding them in the middle of a container for shipment . #% This question should be addressed and I am happy that the President-in-Office agrees with me that this is an issue which the European Union should take up . #% In the UK it is commonplace that consumers can and do benefit from sales promotions , for example coupon vouchers . #% In particular , I would like his views on the reflections of the Europol expert who said that there was no effective cooperation or coordination because of a series of political , legislative and judicial problems . #% 
I would prefer the number of vessels going into these waters to be more transparent . #% So it is important to remove the older animals . #% It is one thing to have poor output prices , but it is a double penalty when inputs are not available at world market prices . #% I hope that when we come to deal with the matter in the House tomorrow the Verheugen incident will have simply served as a timely reminder that we must get our signals clear and avoid giving mixed messages with regard to this strategic priority . #% European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry . #% It is easy to exaggerate the contribution from aviation to the present problem of climate change , and emissions from all transport sectors are of concern to the air quality issue and the climate change debate , which is the number one item on every environment agenda . #% Mr President , it is a matter of very great concern that the security situation in Iraq has deteriorated very badly in recent weeks . #% It should be continued . #% This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement . #% Thus I support the essence of the TSE structures endorsed in this report . #% Thank you to those who have enabled more money to be spent on the important area of science and society which includes a detailed examination of ethics . #% The Bösch report quite rightly praises the cooperation between Parliament and the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman 's office and the invaluable procedure of referring complaints to the Committee on Petitions where they fall outside his remit . #% It was announced as a letter even on the agenda of the Civil Liberties Committee on the day of adoption and no deadline was fixed for amendments . #% Firstly , with regard to the issue of Russia and the whole energy area , we have made significant steps with regard to creating a partnership of equals . #% We must , at the same time , overcome difficulties to ensure that crossborder crime is tackled without curtailing the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators . #% Many companies moved away from these archaic practices years ago and the overwhelming majority of consumers want an immediate ban . #% The European Union can not add insult to that injury by saying that it is not its responsibility that they have a serious problem in the area of foot-and-mouth . #% But internally , within the borders of the European Union , there are continuing difficulties with regard to cooperation and coordination . #% We have to welcome some of the positive things that have happened in recent times . #% I have not received an answer . #% At the launch of the EU-Turkish Foundation of 17 October , Commissioner Verheugen said that these reforms are a significant step towards better protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey . #% Having put the ban in place , I see no option but to hold the line and to continue even if we have to buy our way out . #% That is why , when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund . #% The fact of the matter is that there is public reporting of the results which are carried out by each national standards authority within every Member State of the European Union . #% All the countries seeking to accede to the EU regard the prospect of membership of the Union as an essential ingredient in achieving the transformation of their economic and political structures . #% We certainly know that this is an important contribution to both those priorities . #% Furthermore , it would be a betrayal of the philosophy of the founding members of this Union . #% The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer . #% Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States , so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur . #% Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur . #% It is questionable whether it is acceptable that a Member of this Parliament be paid more than , for example , the president of his own country , which could happen in certain cases . #% Well in excess of EUR 1 billion has been given to promote peace-building , understanding and tolerance . #% In short , we know that companies that do not get paid are at risk of collapsing , with knock-on effects for staff and suppliers . #% I really think that people should be extremely cautious . #% 30 years ago the world was very different . #% Following the mid-term review , farmers are looking for alternative ways to carry on their business . #% While I accept that one could broaden the focus , I think the way he drilled it down in his first draft is the way it ought to stay because the greatest problem inside this Union is unemployment . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission and Mr Trichet . #% Madam President , the Commissioner has made three proposals . #% Although this issue was not a subject for conciliation as no parliamentary amendment to the Council 's common position had been adopted , by bringing it into the conciliation process the Council violated Article 251 ( 4 ) of the EC Treaty . #% I know that the President-in-Office spent some time last month discussing this matter very widely . #% I want to impress on the Commission and the Community the importance of showing sympathy and solidarity with China in this horrific disaster and urgently extending what help they can . #% The encyclopaedia came to the conclusion that mankind could never exterminate this species . #% That is a scandal . #% The best-placed people to do this and present what is needed are people with disabilities themselves . #% However , not everyone has access to this knowledge base . #% Mrs Doyle referred to the scare in my home county in my constituency in Northern Ireland . #% All of us must be concerned with the continuing decline of rural populations , the deteriorating age profile of our farmers and the real threat to the traditional family farm . #% We must also guarantee that the necessary staff training is put in place to make these changes work . #% Over 95 % of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world . #% The industry itself claims that fuel efficiency , direct routing and new technology have already achieved a 70 % reduction in aircraft emissions over the last 30 years and that air traffic management , improved holding patterns over airports , and replacement of older planes with state-of-the-art technology in fleet renewal could reduce climate-change impact even further as the number of flights increases each year . #% We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated . #% Eventually this practice will catch up with us . #% The Security Council must send a clear message to all parties involved to ensure that they adhere to agreements already entered into and that they end the violence now . #% Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done . #% Mr President , I feel that none of us must lose sight of the fact that the European Union is seen as irrelevant and unresponsive to the crises in our world today . #% Clarification is undoubtedly necessary . #% I welcome the fact that the Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 per cent between the years 2008-2012 . #% Our policies in Africa lack coherence . #% I was pleased to support it . #% We should withhold our consent to ACTA until we receive written guarantees on these critical issues . #% It also constitutes an improvement as regards strengthening the equal treatment of all EU nationals . #% Furthermore , can I have the Commission 's confirmation that it will stick to the memorandum 's criteria as to safety and that we will always ensure its safety is equal to that of the EU ? #% Mr President , the resolution by the Green Group was tabled first . #% Are our rules and regulations concerning animal movement and animal traceability all that they should be ? #%
