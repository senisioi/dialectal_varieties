The 1926 census in Ireland found that more than half of the entire population of the country was engaged in agriculture and yet the country did not produce surpluses and there were people short of food . #% Mr President , I take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the families of five young teenage girls who tragically lost their lives two days ago in Ireland in an accident involving a school bus in which they were travelling . #% As far as environmental protection is concerned , let me highlight intelligent energy , for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament . #% You will see in item 7 that I have been named as Mr rather than Mrs McNally . #% We are all aware that the agri-sector is beset by low margins , and the least , I think , that EU farmers can expect is that the cost of inputs should not be increased by the failure of the EU to act sufficiently quickly to establish authorisations . #% The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority . #% I should like to express my strongest possible objection to the operation of that veto in the Security Council , because it effectively vetoes , not only the mandate by the United Nations in relation to Sfor , but also the foreign policy of Ireland and other countries which operate in Sfor based on the UN mandate . #% Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government . #% Now , just to get back to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty currently being negotiated in Geneva : there must not be any loopholes to allow countries to conduct nuclear tests . #% I do not find this acceptable . #% We know only too well that major environmental disasters respect no international frontiers . #% Under the current patchwork of legislation , without sufficient information on the majority of existing chemicals , we are unsure of the quantity of chemicals used and the effect on our health and our environment . #% On a basic human level , a constant supply of good quality products is essential to best provide for the people of Europe who need them because of disease and illness and to that extent we must be able to give certainty as regards the quality of the end product as well as the method of collection , testing , processing and storage . #% I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , European standards of food safety do not apply . #% In supporting this report , I commend to members the points concerning the role of organisations dealing with disabilities and other NGOs who have been powerful advocates on their behalf , and who have listened to the voices of the people and who grasp the opportunity to change the world for the better for all of us . #% When the Burmese Prime-Minister-in-exile visited Dublin recently he expressed fears that the European Union would ease its pressure on the generals in power for trade reasons . #% I believe that the EU environment ministers appear to have already reached a ` common orientation ' on this Directive in June 2002 . #% The Baltic Sea issue was a very contentious one dealt with by the committee in harmony with other committees of the Parliament . #% The Commission is best placed to set out these rules . #% Today most of the instruments which affect employment prospects for their citizens are still in the hands of the Member States - rates of wages and social welfare , the length of hours worked and infrastructure within the individual states . #% Abortion rates in Ireland were referred to . #% In this context the support for agriculture - it is substantial and I acknowledge that because it represents almost 50 % of the entire budget - must be seen also as a subsidy to consumers . #% If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world , we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem . #% I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice , but it is important that we be brave enough to say , `` Of course , we have problems , but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way '' . #% As many speakers have mentioned , we know that in many situations there are problems regarding access to legal representatives before and during trials . #% To remove Sunday as a day of rest puts yet another obstacle in the way of successful family life . #% As far as Mr Alyssandrakis ' report is concerned , I would welcome a breakthrough in fusion research , not least because it is far less dangerous than nuclear fission and we need to have an alternative to that form of energy . #% The 2001 report is an interesting one . #% I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report . #% Broadly speaking I agree with the approach taken in the Commission 's communication on the future of aquaculture . #% It is essential , therefore , that there are international rules and regulations with regard to the treatment , respect and promotion of people with disabilities . #% Over the past decade , Ireland has been progressively reducing its taxation which has been led to an increase in employment , an increase in budget surplus and continued sustainable growth . #% We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime . #% Mr President , I would like you to take note that under the new rules by the Bureau I am present but I am not participating in this vote . #% However , one line jumped out at me , and that is that TACs can not control fishing mortality because they control landings but not catches and discards . #% This is not the way to do business . #% Consumers remain confused and bewildered . #% I would like to acknowledge the historic period of enlargement which will happen under your watch and welcome into the Community our ten new Member States with their considerable scientific enterprise and research skills , which must be harnessed and developed to full capacity . #% These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention . #% In fact President Arafat and Prime Minister Barak have already signed the memorandum to implement the Wye River Accord and to resume the final status negotiations . #% He has demonstrated a great deal of sensitivity in this area and for that I thank him . #% We debated this report in the Subcommittee on Human Rights on 23 November 2004 , again on 31 January 2005 and on 17 March -- St Patrick 's Day -- 2005 . #% It is important for us to ensure that our new Rules of Procedure are unambiguous , direct , and able to deal with the actual powers that we have and not try to create new ones . #% Attacks on living standards and democratic rights need to be jointly defeated by Israeli and Palestinian workers . #% Tobacco advertising tends to glamorize smoking , but there is nothing glamorous about smoking , about cancer , chronic bronchitis and all the other tobacco-related illnesses that kill many millions each year . #% We have to put a real value on those who care at both the beginning and end of people 's lives . #% Mr Verheugen , who is here today , played a central role at one stage , a number of years ago . #% I am pleased that the communication is being debated so that the Member States and the public can learn more about the challenges involved . #% I compliment the candidate countries on their efforts to conform to the stringent requirements for entry . #% When we look at horses that have been used for recreational purposes that end up going into the human food chain , it is essential that a precautionary approach is taken to ensure that public health and consumer protection take priority . #% I caution against reform of sheepmeat at the expense of other sectors , particularly beef . #% I would hope that the Council will take this issue very seriously and not give in to pressure , despite the fact that there may be some countries in the European Union that would wish to do so . #% The Council has just reached a political agreement on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organization in the Member States of the EU . #% There are far more aspects to energy than just environmental aspects . #% Many key European policies are being re-evaluated in the context of the Agenda 2000 programme which is to be put into place to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union itself . #% In both cases the government , farming organisations and farmers are committed to eliminating any possible threat to the environment and in particular the quality of groundwater . #% The principal function of these Houses of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens . #% For instance , to say that a fish was caught in a fishery which is sustainable or responsibly managed is utterly meaningless , because one person 's definition of ` responsible ' may differ very much from another 's . #% Without the political support and the goodwill of the people of Europe , the EU as a political and economic entity will be badly weakened . #% Moreover , women are less likely to be re-employed when they lose their jobs . #% Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe , an enterprising Europe , a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues , give in one adjective , one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling Europe . #% Mr President , I welcome the report we have heard in the Conference ; the sensitive way in which it has dealt with dossiers such as crime , sexual exploitation and illegal immigration will prove very helpful when eventually we have to move into the serious negotiations and the application of the new powers of the Amsterdam Treaty . #% He said he believes it is lagging behind - that real progress must be made in the year 2002 , because fisheries are established in areas where there is no alternative source of employment . #% First , the perception that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increasing inflation in Member States has done serious damage to its image , even though , according to official figures , only 0.2 % of the increase is attributable to the euro . #% For example , it put MEPs on an equal footing with national parliamentary representatives in the matter of various allowances and expenses . #% There are derisory fines which are no deterrent to any continuation of these kinds of offences . #% 
I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long , cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland . #% Although I support the report , I wish to make known certain reservations pertaining to same . #% Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to death in absentia in 1997 by the People 's Court , which was organised by the Vietnamese army occupying Cambodia at the time . #% I believe that we have an obligation not to disappoint them . #% However , for fear that we will become complacent in this House , 10.7 % of the inquiries referred to the European Parliament , the second highest number . #% It is a great pity that we are moving away from the social policy aspects of these Funds , which provided some relief for companies and , in particular , the workers of companies who were being restructured . #% Clearly , there is an urgent need to increase the demand for bioenergy in order to combat climate change and greenhouse gas emissions , to reduce oil dependency and to enhance technology and economic development within the European Union . #% Members have tabled questions to be answered by the Commission , they sit here while you allow supplementary after supplementary and let Commissioners run on at will and our questions are not reached . #% However , as Mr Harrison has just pointed out , the government has responded by ordering all the elected members not already in jail or exiled to report twice a day to local authorities , basically to stop them convening on their own . #% I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met . #% It is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% I would like to congratulate the Commission on the tremendous work that it has done in dealing with all the applicant countries and the fact that it is now in a position to recommend ten countries for accession . #% It is my opinion , and the opinion of EPP members in the Committee on Budgets , that there are sufficient funds to meet the request of the Committee on Agriculture : if the Doyle position is accepted by this Parliament and by the Council there are sufficient resources to finance the policy . #% The Indonesians have forced the international community to turn a blind eye to what is going on there , and they hold the international community to ransom . #% Recycling can not solve the problem as potential recycling rates under ecological criteria are projected to reach only 5 % by 2020 . #% As Mrs Corbey rightly points out in her report -- and I thank her for her work -- it is only fair and equitable that the same approach be taken with regard to our colleagues in the new Member States , as was indicted to them during the accession negotiations . #% Respect for human dignity is as important a right in any democracy as the right to freedom of expression . #% We have a great density of institutional relations - we have touched on some of them in the debate already . #% It is important that the fund plays a role as an incentive to less film-friendly banking countries to participate in film financing , to take a risk , to take a gamble , to take a toss at producing something so that they might ultimately not just be very proud of their own involvement but also it might actually make some money for them as well . #% Following on from what the Minister has already said , I would like to put two propositions to her . #% in writing . - I abstained on the final vote on the EC-Israel aviation agreement as a mark of protest with regard to the ongoing crisis in Palestine . #% I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation . #% However , the President-in-Office has made a very good start . #% The German Government has done the European Union a service by raising this debate and by posing the challenge of how economic policy should be set and governed in Stage 3 of the Union . #% Therefore , can the President-in-Office give us a commitment that he will bring it forward at the next Council meeting to see if there can be a reversal of the decision or an extension of some kind ? #% I support the right of the Palestinian people to form a state , but one which comes about on the basis of negotiation and goodwill of all interested parties and not one which is brought about as a result of coercion . #% Mr President , it is pleasant to renew acquaintance in this forum with Mr Pearson , who served with effect for some time in Northern Ireland , as did Commissioner Mandelson . #% Given that the Commission and the Council had already accepted that this was a necessity and had already agreed to set up the inter-university programme in Venice , this should be supported . #% What is going on is unacceptable . #% This is one of the reasons it has been successful to date . #% You , Mr Prime Minister , more than any of your predecessors at any of these international meetings , went out of your way to meet people , to conciliate , to provide people with places to stay . #% It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives . #% If we believe an exercise will work , we will pursue that exercise . #% This is only partly related to price . #% Under existing EU Treaties such tax changes require the unanimous support of all EU Governments . #% We must reassure both customers of electricity and gas - in particular domestic users and workers in this sector - on this point . #% This can not be allowed to continue . #% In those countries which operate a general clause , we also know that operates differently . #% In relation to environmental protection , it is extremely important that the EU is given some sort of control . #% If we here tomorrow decide to add patentability to software , programmers all over Europe might be breaking the law without even knowing they were doing so until it was too late . #% The objective of the EPR is to make producers financially responsible for their products when these become waste so an upstream effect is created which leads to design for the environment , taking account of the durability , repairability or upgrading , disassembly or recycling of the product . #% Medication must not be incorporated into feed to be used for animals within one month of slaughter . #% They fear and distrust each other too much . #% On a separate but not unrelated matter , a conciliation process is going to begin shortly in relation to the issue of the new EU regulation concerning the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation security . #% I want to underscore the importance of the present period . #% This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation . #% This gear helps with the live release of marlin and so can contribute to the conservation of the stocks . #% At a time when multiple crises seriously threaten the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is all the more important to ensure that our development policies are not undermined by action in other policy fields . #% It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons , or their components , into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation . #% I wholeheartedly support the proposal that Member States incorporate public libraries in their general initiatives concerning the information society . #% Finally , what impact , if any , would this have on guaranteeing on a Europe-wide basis the car which may be bought in another state ? #% To do so would be to show contempt for the voice of the people , not just in Ireland , but throughout Europe . #% I should be grateful , Mr President , if you would send our sympathy and condolences to his family on behalf of the Members of this Parliament . #% Any economic instruments must have clear environmental objectives , rather than fiscal ones , and must be part of an overall package that addresses technological , operational and infrastructural improvements . #% If that is what the rapporteur has given you , then I am happy to go along with that division . #% I welcome this report . #% This purpose is achieved by ensuring that laboratory activities are accredited by the accreditation body to comply with international standards . #% For the 21st century our motto should be giving our citizens the tools to cooperate and to work within the new Europe . #% Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis . #% Mr President , I am using my one-and-a-half minutes to give once again a very brief report to Parliament on my work as the President 's mediator for transnationally abducted children . #% Madam President , I wish to thank Mr Rehder for his report . #% Returning Famagusta would be an excellent opportunity for Turkey to show not only the original inhabitants of Famagusta but also the EU and the rest of the world that it is a peace-loving and peace-supporting nation . #% However , I also led the majority of the group inadvertently into voting against paragraph 8 due to an incorrect voting indication . #% If so , would you undertake to circulate this report to the Members of the European Parliament , in particular to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ? #% The list is very long . #% The UN estimates that all but one of its emergency appeals for humanitarian aid in 2007 were climate related . #% 
A European Union arms export control agency should be set up in order to protect the human rights of the citizens of the ACP countries . #% Therefore I would like to ask colleagues to support amendments 166/167 , 170/171 , 175 and 194 , and to oppose the inclusion of any genetic contamination threshold , which means to oppose the AGRI Committee 's amendment 41 and any others with this effect . #% On entrepreneurship , is it not about time that we heard some of the results from the many benchmarking exercises which have been undertaken ? #% Now that the Commission has recognised that the policy content for development cooperation must be established by codecision , it is time for it to submit formal legislative proposals on geographical and thematic priorities , so that Parliament and Council can finally start the process of legislating . #% We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004 . #% There seems quite a lot of evidence to back up these allegations . #% The EU at all levels is a partnership with the national governments . #% The strategy paper , which has been under consideration in the Council , has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found . #% It is a tragedy that the Irish Government failed , and in fact , did not even try , to have adequate safeguards included in the draft changes to protect Irish neutrality and did not propose that the objective of disarmament be written into the Treaty . #% I therefore call on all employers to be consistent in their approach to social dialogue and to take a positive view of the new directive . #% We hope he will soon be back with us . #% Papadimoulis report #% It is a call for real peace . #% I thank the rapporteur and the committee for supporting those amendments . #% With the defeated EU Constitution there is now even less justification than ever for this foolish proposal . #% We sincerely hope that the Commission will consider carefully its next steps , not only from a purely legal point of view , but also in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached in Conciliation . ' #% We have in Mr Barroso the ideal candidate . #% The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions . #% We in Ireland are exporting jobs as well . #% in writing . - I support the conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency by the European Community . #% I will use the meeting at the end of the month between Congress and the Members of this Parliament to further promote the dialogue and ensure that we can restart it . #% Interestingly enough , not one person has been arrested in connection with those 40 deaths ; not one person has been convicted in connection with those 40 deaths . #% The issue , for example , of renationalization of the common agricultural policy , on the basis that such a development is implied by a process of simplification of the common agricultural policy , means in effect its dismantlement , and certainly would not be acceptable . #% I will oppose strongly any attempts to turn that review into a reform . #% We urgently have to take this issue on but what I fear is happening is an attempt by some Member States to renege on agreements that they made in Edinburgh and fail to meet the targets they agreed . #% The Islamic world is outraged , and rightly so , at the genocidal policies being pursued in Iraq . #% I make this appeal for the record : even though this is only an opinion , Ecofin might show some courtesy to Parliament by meeting with us so that we can register with them too our concern that we should be properly consulted . #% We have beautiful offices , fully equipped . #% We have a lot to learn from each other on this and exchange of best practice is important . #% I am asking for cohesive action and for it to be made much clearer to the citizens how exactly these targets will be met - even if it is the hard way . #% Mr President , as the person chairing the Committee of Inquiry , I can reassure Mr Mote that those witnesses who did not answer be back -- we have a guarantee ! #% In response to Mr Colom i Naval , I would say that now is not the time to deal with the very detailed regulations in the Structural Funds : we will look at them when we draw up specific detailed reports . #% Let me say that the criticism that appears to be directed at Mr Telkämper is totally unjustified . #% Energy efficiency really is the key to meeting the promises that we made at Kyoto , particularly in the domestic sector . #% The publication of the Commission White Paper on food safety and the proposed establishment of a European Food Authority marks a new era in food production . #% I do , however , wish to acknowledge the positive aspects of the Commission proposals , including the findings of the Evaluation Committee report , the simplification of procedures and the introduction of a single premium . #% I will not name them to spare people 's blushes . #% Therefore , it is particularly important that the Committee on Foreign Affairs urgently draw up , as recommended , a comprehensive report on the situation in Iraq , taking into account the consequences of the war and all problems relating to the withdrawal of the illegally occupying forces , rehabilitation , reconstruction and stabilisation in that country . #% For example , proposals on fusion are out of date . #% Mr President , I wish to join with other Members in congratulating the rapporteur , and I would also like to acknowledge the valuable work undertaken by Mrs Agnes Schierhuber , our own rapporteur in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development . #% Yet what we have in this work programme for next year is the promise of a green paper to discuss the principles on which services of general economic interest might - might - be constructed . #% No doubt many of those free market enthusiasts will be rubbing their hands in glee at such a prospect because they can then pick up what remains of the profitable bits of the Irish market . #% I hope this Parliament will give a strong mandate to the Commission to carry this directive forward with renewed momentum following Thursday 's vote , and I look forward to seeing a further improved version of this directive before Parliament in the not-too-distant future . #% It would be a betrayal of the sweat and blood of our parents and grandparents and the lessons that they learned from having a divided Europe ; from having a Europe which is locked behind its own sovereign borders , unable to share power and unable to share a future together . #% This directive focuses only on Member States which are active participants in the production of nuclear energy and on those that accept the waste . #% The aspirations set out in those Tasks were perhaps most rudely challenged by Kosovo where the gap between aspirations and reality was cruelly exposed by an absence of an appropriate operational substance . #% The question of sanctions and whether they are criminal or administrative is very important . #% While we are planning our own compensation package , let us remember third countries like Mauritius , which are being devastated by our sugar reforms . #% We need to look at the long-term energy issue from the perspective of economic viability and sustainability . #% That is part of the problem that exists . #% Self-sufficiency has to be a goal . #% I would encourage the Council in particular to look at the first thematic issue in detail . #% The candidate countries must implement the full range of EU directives and regulations . #% We can also acknowledge that the Court of Auditors plays a role in assisting the Commission to identify weaknesses in its administration and difficulties which it may not have observed in the way Member States implement our various schemes . #% Nevertheless , he was not here in the last Parliament and when he has been here as long as I have he will learn to have a little bit more patience . #% This again is completely unacceptable to our citizens . #% I would hope that the Commission will take on board Parliament 's position , which is the position of the Environment Committee . #% The Irish Government has brought out a Green Paper on sustainable energy , which is to be given special status within our national development plan for the period 2000-2006 . #% As someone said , this has happened before and it should not be allowed to happen again . #% For example , there is a restriction on cigarette advertising on television , yet there is no restriction on alcohol advertising on television . #% I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today . #% It would be irresponsible to leave our needy regions in Britain with uncertainty and insecurity over future grants . #% I myself know what it is like to have a healthy child become disabled . #% There will be enormous benefit to both Europe and Korea on the signing of this deal . #% I recall that in 1992 , in a report that I wrote , Parliament rejected the switch-over system . #% If we can respond clearly and effectively to the challenge presented to us , I believe we will provide a fitting memorial to the little girls who were so brutally murdered in Belgium . #% 
If Europe is to protect the future diversity of crops , it must ensure that farmers are guaranteed such free access and use . #% This mission has troops coming from Sweden , the Netherlands , Poland , Austria and Ireland . #% It is impossible to simultaneously satisfy both the market and industry while conserving resources . #% . -- Mr President , this own-initiative report , prepared jointly by myself and Mr Silva Peneda , with the essential support of our respective staffs , is a very important contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe and the role that Europe 's social model can play in re-energising the unification of our continent . #% As such it is an ambitious and wide-ranging directive , very much in line with the agenda set out in the Commission 's action plan for skills and mobility . #% Rather , we must promote as normal for all Member States the tax regimes which have been shown to be successful . #% Mr President , regarding the order in which amendments would be voted , I would suggest that when we look at those amendments referring to the date we take first those furthest away from the Commission 's proposal , which includes a date . #% I do not believe that we should be producing European directives that can be interpreted in different ways . #% To conclude , those outcomes will not happen of their own accord . #% Alongside ALTENER , and the research into renewable energy in the 5th Framework Programme , which we hope will be very significant , we need urgent flanking measures such as the `` feed-in directive '' for the electricity market . #% We must not confuse terrorism with peaceful protests , with legal and lawful protests by the citizen . #% I thank the honourable Member for her kind words , which I appreciate . #% Furthermore , while it is important that the observation team should consult local EU diplomatic missions , it must be independent of them and EU missions must not interfere with fellow nationals or the mission as a whole . #% As far as I am concerned this is money laundering : the illegal transfer of money not belonging to Gama to another bank in the Netherlands and subsequently to another bank . #% The fundamental rationale of all EU food aid policy must obviously be to guarantee that the food in question gets to the communities and regions where it is most needed . #% The Commission ' s 1998 annual report on trans-European transport networks gives a clear overall picture of the progress that has been made in certain specific projects as well as containing valuable information on the contributions made to these infrastructural projects by the various sources of Community funding . #% Finally , I urge you , as Prime Minister , to continue to take a firm stand in defence of the justified rebate , which you can properly defend on its own merits ... #% Therefore it is imperative that we protect our postal system . #% I speak here today as somebody who voted against the customs union with Turkey last year because I did not believe the line that I was being given . #% The reason for asking this question is that over the last eight months several huge seizures of illegal drugs and narcotics have been made across the European Union . #% General Morillon , here this afternoon , served at Srebrenica and other places with dignity , despite having a very difficult and effectively impossible UN mandate . #% I think we have managed to achieve an agreement which will free up circulation of safe products on the internal market , while introducing a tougher regime to detect dangerous goods and prevent them from coming onto the market and obviously maintaining tough rules , which we already have in place for food safety , medical equipment and blood products . #% I for one believe that the retention of staging posts is of key importance in this regard , and I am certainly not alone in this view . #% We really need to get our act together at Council level there and indicate a capacity for a maturing EU relationship with all the states in that region . #% The illegal drug trade is responsible for a great deal of misery in each of our countries and crime against people and property to fund drug habits means that large numbers of our citizens are living in constant fear for their personal safety . #% From now on every link in the food chain will become an integral part of the production process . #% Others would cite a much higher figure . #% Cutthroat competition in the air seems to be leading to a lowering of safety standards and we have seen a lot of accidents recently which I know will be investigated and we will see what turns up . #% Wild fish stocks in the European Union are about 40 % of what our consumers in the Union need . #% These are some of the areas which featured most prominently in recent street disturbances and which show high levels of deprivation and neglect . #% We now have another dictator in Mugabe : not content with the purge of white farmers , he has now turned on the black population , who have been uprooted from the land and are living in hovels with no food . #% Children , as the most vulnerable and defenceless members of society need extra rights and extra protection . #% That is what my fishermen and fishermen from the remote communities of the periphery of Europe want to hear from you . #% A strong message has to be sent out and it has to be forced to toe the line on this issue . #% Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks . #% The euro , the capital markets , the consumer and EMU #% The country with the highest levels of pollution -- the United States - refuses to consider the global need for their ratification of the Kyoto Protocol . #% Quite honestly , ECHO needs more than a political infusion : it needs somebody to see what is going on there . #% The Iraqi people have suffered too much . #% Finally , we need to step up our actions in the regions . #% Do they not know that we have armed the perpetrators of this genocide for the last 25 years ? #% I believe this directive is an unacceptable assault on the right of citizens to choose how they look after their health and well-being . #% While the government in Spain is seeking to end ETA bloodshed through dialogue and negotiation , it is incumbent on all democratic parties , both inside and outside Spain , to offer support to the process . #% I think the labelling of food produce is something that is to be commended . #% Can we see legislative programmes directed towards that ? #% Although I have been a constant critic of Turkey 's human rights record and its treatment of the Kurds , I also strongly support the decision of the 1999 Helsinki European Council to recognise Turkey as an candidate country . #% Since you , Commissioner , will evidently be using the European Group on Ethics as an instrument for conducting the framework programme on research , can you let us know to what extent you will inform Parliament about the advice given to you by that group , about the composition of the group and indeed the discussions that you have with the group and with its Chair - when that person arrives ? #% The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues . #% This would have been particularly problematic in small Member States like Ireland where there are some naturally imposed restrictions on energy subdivisions due to the geographical isolation and the limited size of the population . #% We must not allow our industry in the European Union to place its operators at any further disadvantage . #% We can best guarantee the fight against unemployment and encourage social cohesion in Europe through having an employment-rich economy and through having sustainable models of welfare . #% Instead of harassing Father Cullen , the Filipino authorities should welcome the work that he has been doing in their country . #% I am quoting the author Mark Kurlansky in his book ` Cod : A Biography of the Fish that changed the World ' . #% How can we have a free market when there are three companies with EUR 10 billion or more at their disposal to buy up other companies ? #% Genetic research has much to offer mankind in alleviating disease , enhancing food security and quality and in the area of environmental protection . #% Finally , on this day we remember the victims and their families whose lives have been shattered . #% Equally we need to take a strong stand on food imports from outside the EU . #% Following on from Mr Titford 's comments , today I tried to contact an undertaker friend to see if he had anything he wished to add tonight , but it seems he is on his holidays somewhere , as it so happens . #% Lessons have to be learnt from this tragedy . #% The European Union 's efforts to support this minority language are immensely appreciated . #% The situation has changed so much since the matter was discussed by the Council of Presidents that I would urge you to find time , perhaps during the discussion of the regulation you have just referred to , for us to have a Commission update this week here in Parliament . #% In Ireland , as in many other places , we can not begin to deal with the problem of deteriorating human health or clean up our environment without tackling the problem of old mines and the waste that was left behind when the mines were closed and the mining companies dissolved . #% It is regrettable but understandable that problems have increased in the areas of the structural funds , because we have reached an unprecedented level of spending and the regulations in the first place were difficult , as was drawn attention to last year . #% The only insurance is positive planning based on properly focused research . #% I hope this Parliament , the media and the public will recognise his tremendous record in not only completing his legislative programme but bringing Parliament along in support when people said it could not be done . #% in writing . - I am a Socialist , which means I believe that all human beings are equal . #% 
One has no objection to that . #% The EU has a responsibility to make Darfur an ongoing priority for the UN . #% In this climate this is simply not good enough . #% Let us become the voices of a new world . #% Here I would urge support for the establishment of a binding legal instrument laying down minimum guarantees as regards income , social protection , medical treatment and housing , and particular attention must be devoted to the needs of elderly people . #% From 1960 to 1990 it has been estimated that one kilometre of unspoilt coastline has been developed every day and 30 hectares of dune habitat have disappeared every day . #% We get very little opportunity to speak to the Commissioner . #% We , in Parliament , are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution . #% Most importantly , now we can bring in private financing to give the extra impetus and kick-start needed . #% We are no better or no worse , but we do compare with the higher standards of accountancy and accountability . #% Mr President , first of all I welcome the report . #% In Geneva , and elsewhere , the EU should take every opportunity in a united way to express its displeasure . #% If we are to achieve success in this area , we can not do it by making agreements between our own institutions - the Council , Parliament and the Commission . #% EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant , and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant . #% We can not have a race to the back of the queue as Member States scurry to avoid attracting outside investment for fear of getting a rap on the knuckles from Brussels . #% Well in excess of EUR 1 billion has been given to promote peace-building , understanding and tolerance . #% In the case of beef alone , prices would actually fall below the price of production . #% What I have not heard today - perhaps I missed it because I was a bit late for the President-in-Office 's speech at the beginning - is what progress has been made in relation to finding a vaccine . #% At this point we know that the new countries will come in - at the most optimistic estimate - with something like 30 % of the GDP of existing Members . #% It is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts . #% In the light of this , we must make certain that the restrictions domestically imposed do not impact disproportionately to the detriment of other key industries and public life generally . #% A recent study by the UK Government , which I am sure the President-in-Office may like to comment on , looked at benchmarking and our partnership with business with the textile industry . #% I think the feed industry itself would welcome clarity on that , because too often zero tolerance has given rise to huge costs as well as concern and confusion within that industry . #% I have always believed that if the EU requires that of farmers , it must pay compensation . #% He said that without John Hume there would truly have been no peace process , and of David Trimble he remarked that without David Trimble there would have been no peace agreement . #% However , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva , then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Piétrasanta , for his thorough work on the Galileo positioning system . #% The European leaders in Göteborg will address two primary subjects , namely the enlargement of the European Union and how best to solve many of our environmental problems . #% Mr President , I wish to make just two short points concerning the avian flu situation . #% The political declaration they adopted requires governments to implement new strategies and programmes to reduce drug demand , and new laws to counter money laundering by 2003 . #% If we reduce the fishing effort to such an extent that fishermen can not meet their legitimate repayments there is no future for them . #% There are lessons for us all to learn from the results of the Nice Treaty referendum . #% Have I understood correctly ? #% Mr President , with regard to this particular resolution , let me say I am appalled at the opportunist hypocrisy of certain groups and certain individuals in this House . #% The 350 million people who make up the membership of the European Union will not thank either the European Parliament or the European Commission if we are seen in the public eye as having a fractious relationship in any shape or form . #% We are trying to prevent people from coming in and we need to implement measures which will prevent asylum-seekers resorting to traffickers in their effort to reach a country where they can seek asylum , as they are entitled to do under the Geneva Convention . #% The Statute we are dealing with , taken together with the Statute of Members of Parliament and with the very positive outcome of the Convention , indicates a coming-of-age for the European Union . #% With more help of that kind , people could actually keep their affected loved ones at home with them longer if they wanted to . #% The revised Stability and Growth Pact gives more countries more time to correct excessive deficits and provides more leeway for countries with strong public finances . #% We have been able to put across important points despite working quickly . #% The EU , through the Globalisation Fund , has allocated a fund that will directly help the economically vulnerable in the area . #% As a member of the Development and Cooperation Committee of the European Parliament , I recognise that AIDS is rampant , particularly on the continent of Africa . #% Minimising risks can best be achieved by improving controls on the distribution and use of pesticides , as well as substituting the more dangerous substances with safer alternatives . #% I commend to the honourable Member and to Members of the House an examination of the local development programme currently under way in Ireland . #% That amount of money would finance the needs of a common agricultural policy for the first enlargement . #% Demand for GM food is not driven by consumers . #% With a cattle population in Ireland of between 7 and 8 million in recent years , some 10.5 million TB tests have been undertaken annually in some 138 000 herds . #% There is a message for Stockholm that our commitment is real and deep and must be prioritised to deliver . #% I should add , arising from matters raised in the hearings but not concluded , in respect of some of the individual nominee Commissioners that should any legal or criminal proceedings arise - which I do not anticipate would necessarily be the case but which would pose problems for the integrity of the Commission - we would expect the President of the Commission to act in such circumstances . #% This does not mean , however , drafting a lawyers ' charter , which is what we are in danger of doing . #% The Irish presidency will progress as far as possible the measures adopted by President Santer in support of job creation in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council . #% The ELDR Group looks forward to deepening our engagement and dialogue with him , and to a very productive period for the future . #% There is little point in sending Members of Parliament half way across the globe , to be part of a Commission/Council/Parliament delegation , a Community delegation , if one third are kept outside the door albeit with briefings when the business is done . #% Nothing could be further from the truth , indeed the least developed countries have very little to gain from such a gesture . #% Mr President , I am sure everyone here is aware that the Greens have fundamental problems with the European Union 's approach to fisheries agreements . #% What we have seen here today is the ability of an institution such as ours to raise our voices in grave concern and yet come up with no solution . #% Europe is very fortunate at this particular time to have the presidency held by a Prime Minister who is one of the longest-serving heads of government in any of our Member States . #% They should work with the clubs to inform and educate the general public , and especially sports fans and supporters , about the scale of the problem of forced prostitution and trafficking in human being . #% The success of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is beginning to create a cultural shift away from traditional litigation . #% They will give it the role that Parliament must , and should , have and which we know it has not got . #% The problem is that particularly in Germany , social workers seem to be able , under German law , to make decisions about access and custody which , in some cases , take no note of decisions made in courts in other countries . #% I would also like to endorse what has been proposed to us by the Commission in relation to the political problem in Turkey and Cyprus , with the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey . #% The International Federation of the Red Cross has said that hundreds of thousands of people in Vietnam are likely to be short of food over the next nine months . #% When we consider suicide , then we see that getting it right can even be a matter of life and death . #% Mr President , on a point of order , you may be aware that Parliament 's entire e-mail system has practically crashed . #% I pay tribute to the efforts of those local people , sometimes in impossible circumstances . #% 
Let us not pretend that this will be enough resources to provide for the enlargement of the European Union and meet the needs of the states which expect to become full members . #% We will have failed them unless we tackle racism and xenophobia in the European Union . #% Already some , but not all , Member States are involved in the eurozone and the Schengen Agreement . #% However , there are some basic differences of opinion which must be emphasized , the importance of which should not be underestimated . #% I would like to be associated with Mr Whitehead 's remarks in relation to Mrs Kuhn . #% Therefore it is important that Basel II upholds current market practice in the covered bond area . #% Despite our wealth , when you left office last year , we still had one of the lowest social spends in the EU . #% To that end , may I finish by echoing Mrs Roure 's call for both the Commission and the Council to put their money where their mouth is as regards tackling inequality across the Union . #% I have already thanked Mr Collins in his absence for his kind words earlier and I appreciate his introductory remarks . #% We can speak about it again and again , but there must be positive action to get it up and running , to give a core element to innovation and research in Europe . #% That is a key and defining question which arises from Turkey 's application for EU membership . #% On another occasion , a previous Commissioner indicated that the UK Government was unhappy with the Commission revealing the information which was being sought by the Committee on Petitions . #% We need to work together on the second reading to ensure that this dangerous practice is stopped , and also to ensure that valuable European metals remain in Europe . #% The extraordinary thing is that the Irish Government has now had to reverse its decision to deport that young man and , having declared that it regrets making a mistake , has now issued him with a six-month visa . #% It is about time that we all faced up to our responsibilities because we have not only ourselves and our environment to think of but future generations as well . #% As I have already said , the early resolution of the case and the dropping of the charges obviated the need for such action as we intended to take . #% Madam President , I too should like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the Jackson report . #% Those problems exist and we have dealt with the solution to the problem . #% People are moving across borders to take up jobs , some people are retiring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other Member States . #% I also think it is rather bizarre that last week the DTI produced a press release celebrating the massive amount of funding they would be getting from Objective 2 - a bumper share of funds - when in fact they seem incapable of spending it . #% I may not always agree with him but as a working Member of this Parliament he is a fine example and always has been . #% It is a very , very poor example for the General to have undertaken . #% For example , today there were 226 in the first vote after the issue of the quorum was raised . #% When we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap . #% We should use all our influence to ensure that a role for the United Nations is accepted in this respect because there is no other way . #% In particular , let us ensure that we can do this collectively for the betterment of all mankind . #% It played second fiddle to the rush to get agreement on the Euro . #% The Commissioner mentioned the need to extend CDMs . #% We use it rather lightly here and as a result it can cause confusion . #% Mr President , I support the proposals in the Linkohr report . #% So , over the next ten years - as my colleague has said - the area we should focus on is ensuring that people now in middle age are given the tools of knowledge , information and education in order to be able to live in the altered world which will be coming about . #% The fact of the matter is that the greater the use of greenhouse gases , the greater the effect that this has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities not only in Europe but world-wide . #% That is in an effort to ensure that nobody would interpret recital C as justifying the setting-up of radical Islamic courts with a view to restoring order . #% For this reason and for the reasons I have already referred to , I propose to abstain on the final vote on this report while at the same time , firmly recording my support for the Amsterdam Treaty . #% It will be available in any case . #% Originally started in March 2000 by the Dutch Government and Dutch fishermen , the project was aimed at clearing the North Sea of litter , using fishing nets . #% New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale . #% The programme seeks to complement , support and monitor the policies of the Member States and to contribute to protecting the health , safety , economic and legal interests of consumers . #% This is discriminatory and needs to change . #% That has to be avoided . #% I too am a dissenting member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution . #% When they are in place , the third principle will come into play : working together in common interests , spilling sweat and not blood . #% This is a special edition on nuclear safety , for which I was asked to write a piece , which was later censured because of the heavy advertising of the nuclear industry in this magazine . #% Many times when we speak about the issues involved , in spite of our best efforts , some of us would like to see new things added to what has already been agreed . #% 61 % of adults visit their local Bring Centre at least once a month , as opposed to only 25 % in 1998 . #% I would like to see the development of small local initiatives which would strengthen rural development by the provision of , say , 20 to 30 jobs per project . #% The Commissioner is explicitly obliged under the Treaties to reply to questions . #% This combination means that there would be a minimum threshold of 500 combining with a Socialist upper threshold . #% Abuse is under-reported . #% The current practice of providing a 10-mile zone could and should be extended to 15 miles without serious disadvantage to the EU deep-sea fleets . #% I am glad we get a chance to reflect on it and to look at the priorities . #% I want to say how thankful the Members are for this . #% Given that earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis have taken place in the past , would it not be prudent for the Commission to set up a benchmarking process to facilitate alert strategies to warn of natural disasters of this kind ? #% I want to see the Commission review the application of relative stability so as to take better account of the need for economic , social and regional cohesion . #% But can he tell me whether the Member States along the route have actually given permission for this transit ? #% Those same three principles are at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland . #% Like the previous speaker , I come from Northern Ireland . #% Commissioner , why did ECHO not foresee this and foresee that food was needed there when so many people were threatened ? #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for their comments . #% In my experience , many directives over the years have had a negative impact on rural areas and rural development because they inadvertently or advertently benefited areas of high population where liberal policies were easier to follow . #% Mr President , I am somewhat intrigued by the background giving rise to the oral question before the House . #% The battle to reduce unemployment is and must remain our first priority . #% It is up to the people to determine what the level of debate and discussion and the final verdict on this Constitutional Treaty will be . #% That is completely unfair . #% in writing . - I support this report , which highlights that precarious work disproportionately affects women workers . #% Each cabinet member should be absolutely required to leave office with the Commissioner . #% 
As the EU has both one of the largest fishing fleets and one of the largest markets for fish , it can play a particularly important role in regard to flags of convenience fishing . #% We voted with cross-party support to ban funding of research resulting in the destruction of human embryos , any kind of cloning , the use of surplus embryos and germline intervention . #% No part of this Community has a better health record and no part of this Community has done everything in its power to conform to what this Commission has said . #% Ireland has consistently supported the European Union and this has been borne out in all of the referenda in my country , where the citizens - and it does not happen in every country - have been given the right to express their views in relation to Europe . #% Mr President , it is good to have hope but it must not misplaced and it must not blind us to reality . #% Had these decisions been fudged , the entire EMU project would have been undermined . #% By no means do we want to tell fishermen that we are offering them anything like a renationalisation or that we are removing the common fisheries policy . #% But the current EU policy is doing them a disservice by continually holding out hopes that there are fish available for them somewhere . #% Parliament is not a rubber stamp , it has the power of codecision . #% If that is the case , the Commission should be concerned about animals whose breeding was partially funded by the EU . #% We believe that the exploration of other forms of stem cell , and indeed comparisons , are essential . #% If the French want to label beef they can do so voluntarily . #% The President-in-Office will recall the reticence , concern and even fearful response of many British and , indeed , Irish citizens to the decimalization of our respective currencies during the 1960s . #% Sinn Féin will support any measures which contribute to the support of such islands . #% We have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights . #% The situation for women in Iraq is unlikely to improve in the near future . #% Madam President , I do not support the integration of the two directives - namely on municipal waste , waste oil , solvents and clinical waste , as well as other non-hazardous waste - into one composite European piece of legislation . #% I would echo the words of Mr Poettering -- and indeed I have learned from my own experience -- that it is much easier to make war than it is to make peace . #% This legislation is just a Band-Aid in terms of the necessity out there . #% It is completely unacceptable that the space policy and EU resources should be funding and facilitating military expansion or the development of new military weapons . #% To such a proposal , I categorically say no . #% I would also like to know , as regards our international obligations under the WTO general procurement agreement with third countries , whether it would be the case , as has been established by Commission services , that the US and Japan would actually be favoured contractors and that our EU suppliers would lose out because we would be operating two distinctly different regimes . #% We all recognise that the livelihoods of everyone involved in these industries is at stake and I have no doubt that we will all work to try and resolve that . #% I would like to ask the Commission specifically to state what action , if any , is envisaged for research under the Fifth Framework Programme to fight Alzheimer 's disease . #% But clearly the European Commission should and must carry out an independent evaluation of all the environmental and public health risks , not just for Ireland and for all the UK but for all the people of Europe . #% I accept that ; we can not carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once . #% If we allow imports into Europe from countries that do not ensure fair wages , we are effectively pricing European companies out of the market . #% The issue of who is going to regulate any new liberalized gas network in each Member State of the EU appears to remain unresolved . #% It is clear that continued support for a closer EU-Turkey relationship , including eventual accession , is the best way to accelerate political reform and progress in human rights . #% The Commission is right to propose making compliance with relevant food safety rules a must for receiving subsidies . #% Furthermore , it will not be French led but Irish led . #% The Belgian Presidency has probably been the best presidency I have witnessed in the 18 years I have been a Member of this House . #% As the signatures to the amendments show here today , that is not the case and should not have been stated , especially at what was a very sensitive time in the concluding stages of the negotiations . #% This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU . #% There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors . #% On the other hand , these people could become our trading partners . #% Criticism of that position will not weaken the Commission but your actions will . #% The new instrument must primarily fund measures which fulfil the criteria for ODA ( Official Development Assistance ) as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee . #% I have to ask the Commission and indeed , we all have to ask ourselves , why is the multiannual guidance programme not being implemented ? #% Childhood is not static . #% What role for Parliament can the presidency and the Council envisage to guarantee effective parliamentary scrutiny of the reserve mechanism ? #% I believe that all of us who are committed to resolving this issue now have a profound responsibility to work together in a cohesive manner , with the interests of the consumer and producers in mind . #% Mr Needle said one in four people had partaken of complementary medicine and seen the benefits of disciplines such as shiatsu or - as in the case of my own mother where conventional medicine failed - received great relief from acupuncture . #% UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction . #% Let us say somebody comes to Ireland for a few years to earn some money . #% President Barroso rightly said that Europe stands in solidarity with our Danish colleagues , because a boycott of Danish goods is a boycott of all European goods . #% As we know , many new plant varieties patented by biotech companies are based on traditional wisdom handed down through the generations , and now farmers are being asked to pay for these patents . #% As the previous speaker said , when we vote on the European Union budget in the future we should remember the common foreign and security aspect , because that is one area in which we are successful . #% I want to state clearly on behalf of the ELDR Group that we wish to maintain the order of vote as indicated . #% So there was much delay there but we did eventually receive that opinion from the Commission , in February of this year , at the stage when the negotiations were well under way with the first wave countries . #% I am delighted that the Irish presidency has already embarked on an intensive programme of consultations with fellow Member State governments during the first working week of its presidency . #% Mr President , the first thing I would like to say is that President Moi must deliver on his preelection promises for constitutional reform . #% As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee , our preference was to vote `` yes '' to reform but `` no '' to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors . #% The agricultural budget has been given to six or seven million people out of the 400 million people in the Union . #% We are 50 % dependent on imports into the EU . #% I believe the outermost regions of Europe should be given the required support that they need where possible in order to compensate for their location and the difficulties that entails . #% But fishermen , generally speaking , do not appreciate what we and the Commissioner have been trying to do on their behalf . #% Madam President , a number of people have already raised issues relating to breaches of human rights and I also wish to raise a question of a serious breach of human rights . #% Institutional reform goes hand-in-hand with the enlargement of the European Union . #% The Irish peace process was based on the unconditional cease-fire of the Provisional IRA . #% The Irish people will resolve their own problems . #% Governments must remember the message from the debate on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty , which is that the general public , acting through the ballot box , are the ultimate decision-makers on the pace and extent of European integration in all policy areas , including monetary policy . #% It is estimated that a low rate FTT could yield nearly EUR 200 billion per year at EU level and USD 650 billion at global level , constituting a substantial contribution by the financial sector to the cost of the crisis and to public finance sustainability . #% It is only when we have that kind of interinstitutional friction that we will truly achieve the best results . #% In the conclusions of the Convention , fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy , instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence . #% The EC Treaty states that ` a high level of human health protection should be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies ' . #% 
Mr President , with a heart and a half I forgive you ! #% The true test of a democracy is the will to redress any potential wrongs and ensure that real justice is served . #% Of course , we must pay due attention to people who are at present within the formal education system , and improving the Erasmus and the Escola programmes and other similar programmes is vitally important . #% I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo that murder is no solution to political conflict . #% Mr President , yesterday morning at the beginning of business - I was not here at the time - Mr Titley made reference to me and criticized me for my statement on the Titley report . #% In this situation , a greater reliance on intermodality is necessary . #% How are dead animals going to be removed from the vehicle ? #% Madam President , on behalf of my political group and my Prime Minister and the British Government , I very much welcome the contribution the EU is making in this area . #% While politicians must lead , that leadership must be accompanied by the involvement of citizens and the promotion of civil society . #% There can be no doubting the depth of the crisis , with , across the EU , a 35 % fall in jobs in ten years , falling prices , falling catches , a 40 % dependence on imports , and a 100 % hike in fuel prices in the last two years . #% It is also true that focusing on the economic agenda does not mean that we are downgrading other agendas , be this the environment or the social agenda . #% Unfortunately , a majority in this Parliament convinced others that the vote should not go ahead . #% Two deadlines have been missed already , and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing . #% I want to welcome the announcement by the Commissioner . #% Many people can not make those investments of their own accord . #% In fact , I would seriously question our data . #% Measures such as this are crucial in order to give authorities the tools and common purpose they need to tackle this Europe-wide problem . #% The new text on comitology is necessary and when the long-term future of this regulation is assessed , this Parliament must have before it independent valuation reports , so where improvements can be made they can press upon the Commission to make those improvements . #% Have you had discussions with the Irish Government on this issue , and to what extent has the Commission considered the implications for a eurozone member of the possibility of a hard landing ? #% My own group has studied with great interest the work of the European Monetary Institute . #% In my limited time I shall add my voice to two specific calls that the report makes . #% I commend the bulk of this report to the House . #% I am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in Asia to notify us of the outbreak . #% That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future . #% On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings . #% My group believes that to do this the presidency must develop proposals to ensure that the European Central Bank , together with the Euro 11 Council , assisted by the Commission and accountable to this Parliament , fully develops the external representation of the euro . #% For far too long the EU has sent its distant water fishing vessels to scour the oceans off Africa and other areas where they can cause immense harm to fish stocks and to local artisanal fishing communities . #% In this regard I have to say that the work of the special committee and the views of Parliament were also significant . #% We believe that government debt in Ireland will be reduced to around 25 % of GDP by the year 2003 . #% It is time that the citizens of Europe received detailed answers to the questions of the effect on safety and the environment of the falsification of data in the MOX facility at the BNFL Sellafield site - falsification that has been ongoing for some years - because of the seriousness of the questions it raises for the safety of MOX fuel in use and for the nuclear installation 's safety generally . #% in writing . - I voted against the Costa report on airport slots , in order to highlight the complete lack of consultation with airport authorities , the lack of debate with MEPs and the rushed nature of the legislation . #% For example , in Northern Ireland our milk production industry is heavily reliant on export refunds available on whole-milk powder . #% The recent Irish Permanent tsb/ESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by 2.1 % between January and May 2007 and a further decline in Ireland is expected . #% What would happen , for example , either now or some time in the future if a general turned up a European Council meeting in place of the Head of Government or State ? #% We must insist that all Member States play by the rules , since capital investment in smaller states will never be forthcoming . #% Indeed , Norway has complained particularly about the Arctic fishing grounds being affected . #% Mr President , I welcome this excellent initiative . #% What would the people of the candidate countries be basing their decision in next year 's referenda on ? #% Air transport has become an integral part of society , allowing us to travel long distances quickly , but also strengthening Europe 's integration , prosperity and political importance . #% Mr President , I warmly welcome the statement made by Minister Roche on behalf of the Irish presidency here this afternoon . #% I congratulate her on it . #% It has been suggested in this debate that Members should vote against this report because it might have a negative effect on the Nice referendum in Ireland . #% One is environmental : the health of the seas . #% We can never justify the means we use to beat terrorism by claiming that the ends are noble . #% It was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again . #% It does not make sense . #% As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland , a peripheral part of this Union , I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures . #% I have no doubt that those who have spoken here regard it as a serious matter . #% My Group leader , Mr Poettering , is right : we must not equate the Arab world with terrorism . #% The holding of democratic elections next year , the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction . #% - The vote on the fund which was tabled late by the Council was facilitated by the EP without debate , on the understanding from all groups including the Greens that there would be no amendments . #% The Commission will shortly bring forward proposals on the next financial perspectives . #% The failure today inside and outside the EU to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to both European enterprises and EU and non-EU workers and citizens . #% In this regard the unique role of farmers as guarantors of food security and quality is far too often taken for granted . #% Safety refresher courses must take place on an annual basis . #% The more elements we drag in , the more un-transparent we make the system , the more difficult it becomes . #% We need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises . #% It is important that we have the framework proposal to put in place uniform systems for the full certification of food supplements . #% This will cause delays for many badly-needed projects throughout the European Union and in my country , Ireland . #% This issue has grave implications for every maritime state in the EU and it has resulted in the cancellation in Ireland of social partnership negotiations . #% I welcome the President-in-Office to Parliament officially since it is the first time I have had this direct contact with him . #% Please protest on behalf of all of us . #% Do the amendments actually violate EU law ? #% We need to see more evidence of other policies contributing to , or addressing , the cohesion imperative . #% If it were not for his efforts in enabling ECU 100 million to be put on the line from the reserve through the supplementary budget , we would not have had the impetus for this tiny success . #% in writing . - I am voting for this resolution to reject the health claim that adding the natural fatty acid DHA to baby food contributes to the normal visual development of infants for a number of reasons . #% 
Please forgive my German accent , but I would not dare quote Bismarck in English . #% Is there anything you can do to help us ? #% Only when they have made a noteworthy move towards democracy should they be removed from the list . #% One area of ongoing concern is the need to ensure the link between economic performance and the generation of wealth , which must then be utilised for social protection . #% We need a respectful dialogue between our institutions . #% It treats the views of the outside world with contempt . #% It important that we incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the existing European Union treaties , but I also hope that the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into the EU as an institution and not simply into the legal systems of the individual Member States . #% You claim to be democrats , but you enslave the working people of Europe to the markets , the financial markets , which lead you around by the nose . #% When you allow this kind of omission and , at the same time , sit down at friendly trade negotiations with China , you are in danger of signalling EU approval . #% Madam President , those of us who have the responsibility of representing the agricultural sector of our individual countries must be concerned , if not alarmed , at the extent of the economic crisis experienced particularly by livestock farmers . #% Sometimes you could be forgiven for getting the impression that economic and social cohesion is a flanking policy . #% A fear that we express : if these duties increase and they are to be the counterpart , taking the White Paper on employment growth and competitiveness , of reducing direct taxes on labour , how do we make the interconnection ? #% Mr President , the Commission 's decision concerning the commercial arrangements which Ryanair has with Charleroi airport is very misjudged . #% Now that we have a High Representative who is a Vice-President of the Commission , that person must be more visible on issues of this kind . #% The other 719 Members may not yet know how Charlie operates and they deserve a chance to see what they are in for . #% Paramilitary groups are a result of clandestine military strategy , and that has to be taken into account . #% Enlargement , being the main subject on the agenda , has been very much at the heart of the referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty in my country . #% Each of those choices had serious disadvantages . #% Cooperation between Member States is the foundation of this Union ; however , that cooperation has always been based on mutual consent . #% Mr President , financial assistance to the applicant states to help advance the process of enlargement is clearly needed . #% I would like to see a more targeted approach being taken to curve the number of road users drivers , young drivers specifically , cyclists , and pedestrians dying , unnecessarily , on European roads . #% Mr Tillich makes the point about his four priorities , which Mr Fabra Vallés referred to and supported . #% Secondly , I am not entirely clear from listening to the Commission whether the incipient ban on trade into the United Kingdom has the goodwill of the Commissioner or not . #% I agree with the Tillich report , and particularly with the author 's strategy of improving budgetary procedures and working towards the preparation of correct projections so that the budget as we see it projected is actually the budget that is necessary to fulfil its objective . #% I fully support the need for efficient databases . #% The `` no '' campaigners , starting from behind with nothing to lose and no one correcting the irrelevancies and , worse , the scare-mongering , beavered away . #% Overall , Parliament 's position is an improvement on the proposals from the Commission and the Council , but it does not go far enough . #% That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each Member States drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected . #% I do not believe in tax harmonisation . #% In particular I can , like Mr Herman , support fully the points laid out in the Donnelly report . #% I concur with the previous speaker 's comments about groups already beginning to work inside Lebanon to destabilise the country yet again . #% We should not be supporting a reference to a zero quota , which is no longer the Australian position . #% I wish to convey to Mr Prodi our very great disappointment at the lack of involvement by the European Parliament in trade matters , which could have been rectified at Nice , but which was not . #% So while such a move sounds easy - and to some it sounds very good - we have to ask a number of questions . #% Are you aware of this , Commissioner , and can you do anything about it ? #% May God helps us all ! #% Permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 . #% I would suggest that it might result in even less financial support to the industry , and markets would not improve . #% The aim to boost employment , productivity and social cohesion in the Europe 2020 growth strategy can not be discarded because of the current financial problems . #% I believe that the Commission has a very firm obligation to help out those countries . #% If we in Europe are not ahead of the rest of the world in our ability to create new ideas and new innovations , we will lose . #% Also , the principle of `` progressive access '' will mean that riders must accumulate experience on smaller motorcycles before moving up to larger engines . #% The word ` cohesion ' did not pass his lips once . #% You touched on it yourself , Prime Minister , during your own questions concerning economics and other areas . #% Let me outline the contribution I believe it can make . #% However , some countries need to cut back on their budgets and others -- like my own , Ireland -- need to spend more on infrastructure , because they have a deficit , but that is not allowed under the rules . #% This has negative consequences also for urban areas . #% I hope that we do not anticipate the same delay in relation to this very vital service . #% I would like to thank the Commissioner for that information . #% There have been impressive improvements under your Presidency in our work rate with regard to co-legislation and that is due to good management of our agenda . #% But there are dangers relating not just to individual actions taken by Member States but also to the question of tax harmonisation , about increasing taxation . #% The situation that now exists challenges the democratic credentials of EU leaders . #% As long as the agreements are designed in such a way as to do minimum damage to stocks which would not be utilised by the local fishermen in any case , it is reasonable for the Union to pass on the benefit of that , just as we pass the benefits of our own stocks in our own waters to the fishermen that get the licences to exploit them . #% Of the estimated 1.2 billion people who live on less than the equivalent of one euro a day , about 250 million live in agriculturally marginal areas , and a further 350 million live in or near forests , of whom an estimated 60 million are indigenous people living in forests . #% Why should a business have to set up four offices and pay a EUR 500 000 deposit ? #% Madam President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on this public health issue . #% I very much hope that the Belgian presidency will use this important time to help end the spiral of violence in the Middle East and seek the recommencement of dialogue between all parties in the region . #% It has taken nine years to get this legislation . #% We do not need more arms in this world - we need less . #% We must ensure that a mechanism is put in place to effect the safe elimination of existing fluorinated gases as well . #% The second challenge is to help rebuild Lebanon after the devastation of the summer . #% In the context of Agenda 2000 , very credible efforts were made to deal with the serious problem of succession in European agriculture . #% Not to do so will I believe be perceived as a considerable set-back . #% Families have been separated and sent to different countries . #% We are all very concerned by media reports coming from Kosovo , especially of rape being used as a weapon of war . #% If there is any possible likelihood of endangering public health by means of the implementation of any particular proposal , one must always veer on the side of caution , and I compliment the rapporteur on her report . #% 
in writing . - Ireland 's society is ageing at an unprecedented rate . #% In the area of environment energy , and particularly emissions-related tax incentives , I have one observation and one question for the Commissioner . #% As has already been said , Europe produces only about one-fifth of its protein needs and we import soya to fill that gap . #% The present enlargement is bringing with it loads of difficulties , generally in the economic field and particularly in the agricultural field . #% Appropriate targets have to be put in place to guarantee the delivery of proper results rather than a mere tinkering with figures . #% The elimination of transaction costs and the lowering of interest rates is good news . #% The Commission 's proposals regarding direct payments to farmers are an essential element of the overall package . #% There were , for example , long delays in obtaining vital information from some countries . #% To minimise the risk to these population centres of course . #% There is a proper balanced way to achieve the rights that everybody here wants to see . #% There , fundamental mistakes were made in the hope of encouraging them away from the paths of terror . #% The fishing industry is always being told to make reductions . #% Where our shared environmental heritage is concerned , the financing must fit the policy , not vice versa . #% ( IND/DEM ) . - Mr President , today we are debating a resolution about humanitarian aid . #% It is what happens in between the summits that matters , and I urge you , Commissioners , to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg , even if it is not enough , is carried through . #% I have been totally and absolutely devastated by some of the stories I have heard over the last year . #% I am quite happy to engage in debate with the minister but the problem is that , in adopting that attitude and in adopting that frame of reference for this debate , he is feeding the paranoia which is at the root of much of the abuse that immigrants and refugees face in their host country . #% Efficient public administrations are necessary not only to enact new EU laws completely , but also to ensure that the Community 's financial resources are used effectively . #% This will ensure that enlargement negotiations can be concluded by the Copenhagen Summit of EU leaders in December 2002 . #% My group will take this challenge seriously and we look forward to cooperating with the Council and the Commission in improving the Agenda 2000 proposals to gain support from the public . #% It is therefore important that the conservation and development communities should work together with indigenous populations and civil society on this shared agenda in order to address the underlying causes of poverty and biodiversity loss . #% -- Mr President , while welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to the House I respectfully request a full explanation for Commissioner Prodi 's absence from the House this morning . #% Was the Member who replaced Mr Casini indeed entitled to vote , as Mr Casini ' s resignation was only announced on Monday evening . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Péry for her report and to say that I agree with her when she implies that the common fisheries policy is just a half-baked policy . #% The EU can now vindicate its claim to a place on the world stage by brokering this strategy . #% The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic . #% A one-size-fits-all policy in relation to environmental noise and the different transport sectors , not to mention differing circumstances in Member States , is not satisfactory legislation . #% That brings us to the question of what their best is . #% The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recently approved an amendment which stated that the competent authorities in each Member State shall identify a sufficient number of suitable unloading premises and notify the European Commission at regular intervals . #% The directive , as some of the speakers have already said , needs to have binding targets in order for the Member States and the entire EU to achieve a significant increase in the share of renewable energies in the total energy market . #% Nevertheless if there is one objective we should set ourselves in this area , it is to use our economic trading strength and our economic resources for the betterment of the Third World . #% Today Mr Juncker gave us a master class in transparency , frankness and humanity . #% The provision of such information would greatly enhance Parliament ' s contribution to the development of a more effective and cohesive EU foreign policy , which is long overdue . #% He said : ' The people , the areas , the community groups at the heart of the problem must be at the heart of the solution . ' #% The state of emergency in Pakistan must be lifted immediately and the Government of Pakistan must respect the boundaries of its Constitution . #% However , in reality , the fear is a fear of change . #% Simply setting minimum prices for imports or financial compensation schemes are not sufficient : further action is required . #% So it is relevant to refer to this . #% Yet , fellow MEPs , we are actually in business , the business of government and , crucially , of overseeing the spending of our constituents ' - our shareholders ' - money . #% What continues to happen in Darfur is an international scandal in humanitarian terms . #% I call on the Irish Government to state clearly what position it will take on these issues before decisions are taken at Council . #% The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq , with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control . #% Thus , it is vital that we investigate whether very small agencies can be effective and can meet the administrative requirements of the Financial Regulations with a very small staff . #% If we can not get the Member States to support that , I would ask that we allow the regions and local authorities which wish to participate to come directly to the Commissioner in Brussels and get actively involved in those pacts . #% Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties . #% I wish to thank him and his colleagues for a very effective and efficient EU presidency . #% I hope that the slogan of the Dutch presidency will become ` opt in or opt out ' . #% For me that is a massive dimension of funding which could very well be invested in the UK economy to help those people in the industry . #% Babies ' health is too important to be left in the hands of a multinational company 's marketing department . #% In Northern Ireland we have a small but determined organic sector . #% Could the Commissioner tell us where our health services directive is and when we will have a draft proposal ? #% Would you confirm that the Dutch presidency has amendments to the Euratom Treaty on the table at the moment , during the IGC process and that it will look at those amendments and/or institute a review of the Euratom Treaty itself during the IGC negotiations ? #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is brought up . #% I quote from the OECD : ' A policy challenge in Europe will be to ensure that simultaneous fiscal consolidation does not have substantial adverse short-run effects on activity . ' #% I note the firm stand taken on several occasions by the President of the Republic of Lithuania , Dalia Grybauskaitė , denouncing draft homophobic legislation as being harmful for Lithuanian citizens and the image of Lithuania , and encourage the President to veto the amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences should they be approved . #% Adequate provision of oil and gas is necessary if the European Union economy is to operate effectively . #% There is quite a lot of hypocrisy concerning this issue , and I would like to refer to my own Minister for Justice in Ireland , John O'Donoghue . #% It is very important for me to state here today , particularly as an Irish European , that whatever the complex set of motives and reasons behind it , the `` no '' to Nice did not signify a `` no '' to enlargement . #% There has been some progress to the extent that , as previous speakers have said , even as late as last week there were moves to legalise the teachers ' trade union . #% We need to clarify a number of things such as the role of EU non-NATO members in such a force and the role of non-EU NATO members in respect of such a force if they wish to participate . #% Primary among these myths is the one about the draft Treaty leading to the creation of a so-called super-state . #% How many more times do we say `` never again '' before we actually take a decision to ensure that when we make a promise like that we will keep that promise and plan to keep that promise ? #% The continent of Europe is not our fatherland and never can be . #% As the rapporteur has said , they must comply without further delay and the Commission must monitor the situation and impose severe penalties where the rules are not fully implemented . #% There is unequivocal scientific evidence about the damage which has been done to many communities as the ozone layer is being depleted . #% The principles at the heart of the European Union can therefore solve conflict anywhere in the world because those three principles are also at the heart of our agreement in Northern Ireland . #% 
We must maintain and improve the incentive to work . #% The Chinese Government insists that it should be permitted to carry on with peaceful nuclear explosions or PNEs . #% Economic growth , in the initial stages , depends more on developing countries ' internal markets than access to markets elsewhere . #% We are dealing with this matter as part of a general concern for the welfare of consumers against a background of recent scares related to food and animal feeds . #% This is an area of great concern . #% If you have a Renaissance masterpiece you handle it with far more care than a magazine poster . #% Parliament should reject the Commission proposal for a Council decision and the conclusion of the Agreement in protest at Israel 's contempt for world opinion and international law , and its failure to engage constructively with elected Palestinian leaders in efforts to bring peace to the region . #% Even in training programmes this is not taken into account . #% Joint programming could be highly valuable in reducing fragmentation of the research effort , leading as it would to a pooling of a critical mass of skills , knowledge and financial resources . #% You have to make societal changes as well . #% Dr Hans Blix and Kofi Annan have made it clear that if they are given sufficient time and if they get full and active co-operation from the Iraqi authorities , then war can be avoided . #% Yes , the United Nations has done sterling work but with no success for weapons inspection to date . #% They stimulate , and are a major source of , job creation . #% I have personally gone round to both Members and visitors to ask them to put out their cigarettes . #% There are no simple mathematical formulae which can be worked out in advance . #% I know you will be addressing some of the anomalies that exist in this but , as Mrs Eriksson has rightly said , they exist in a significant number of Member States and it could cause serious problems in terms of discrimination when we come to implement charges . #% If you want to encourage citizens to support change and reform , you have to explain to them what is in it for them , for their own life prospects . #% The report also deals with trafficking in human beings , the role of international business and its responsibilities in the human rights field and , perhaps most important of all , the issue of impunity and the role of the International Criminal Court , which deserves the support of the European Union . #% Consequently , there is great concern about the implications for the Irish economy and for the employment situation in particular , resulting from a loss of objective 1 status . #% This Parliament rightly objected very strongly and criticised all those who were involved in terrorist acts , called for solidarity amongst Member States and amongst all the institutions of the European Union and sought to ensure that we could cooperate to fight the evil of terrorism . #% Progress on Europol will be the litmus test of proving how serious Member States are in relation to delivering on their promises . #% That would be a drastic approach . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Evans for her contribution on this subject . #% Whether a child is raised within or without a family , both circumstances will have a profound effect upon that child ' s social development . #% When we look at the conflicts around the world we must realise that the production and sale of arms is one of the major factors contributing to global insecurity . #% We must take particular care to avoid duplication of effort . #% I agree with the rapporteur when she states that libraries represent one of the most important systems which afford access to knowledge and culture . #% In the meeting of the Conference of Presidents , all of the group leaders present made a very great effort to try to understand the precedents , to try to understand the complexity and to try to arrive at a reasoned and fair decision . #% As I see it , the Germans have no objection to this woman being released on bail but the objection comes from the British Government - quite unnecessarily so , given the treatment this woman is receiving . #% But really the strategy here is to pretend that there is no alternative and to try to force the Irish people into saying ` yes ' to something they have already said ` no ' to . #% It is particularly pleasing that this has taken place with good faith being shown on both sides and also that they have been addressing political , human rights and social and economic issues . #% As she knows well , and as the United Nations has stated , the situation in Haiti is the worst humanitarian disaster in decades , as the numbers of missing people , victims and deaths continue to rise . #% The statement protects the right of people to protest , which is one of the fundamental issues that people were very concerned about . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Gröner for her excellent report . #% So there are lessons to be learned : set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem - three or four people - Ireland had 30 000 civil servants , and the Irish Civil Service won every time ! #% I urge the Commission to put in place immediately a cross-services task force so as to come up with concrete proposals for reforming the WTO . #% I was one of Parliament 's observers at the elections there last year . #% Finally , there are approximately 600 , 000 refugees missing in the region . #% I urge the IGC not to step back from it . #% Therefore , could the Council and the Commission agree that they would resolutely resist the temptation of bankrolling a pro-Constitution propaganda offensive across Europe ? #% This is a market that will grow . #% I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana , on behalf of the European Union , to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations , but the European Union is undermining his efforts , in my view , by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel 's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated . #% I urge support for the common position , which sets an accepted deadline of 2012 . #% Here , Commissioner , we come to a matter I would like you to focus on : a glaring flaw in the common fisheries policy . #% I hope that their names will also be listed in the agenda . #% However , I would suggest that the technicians and those responsible for this wonderful piece of equipment should modify it in such a way that would allow us to vote on all the candidates , plus and minus , which means that every single one of them will have a neutral symbol beside it . #% If possible , could the Commission make resources available to make sure this woman has proper legal representation to guarantee that she has a fair hearing and that every resource is utilised to save her life ? #% It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay . #% The successful launch of the euro in recent days must clearly be an indication to the German Government that stability is the key to the success of European Union policies . #% It is quite ironic that , when you read through the speeches of the people who were there that day , who won the Nobel Peace Prize , all of them said that the peace efforts they were involved in only came about through dialogue , respect for diversity , tolerance and equality . #% Let us be realistic about what is in this Treaty and what is good and bad about it . #% Can I congratulate you on a successful presidency ? #% That is the prospect facing fishermen in the south and east of Ireland at the moment . #% We also have to keep the necessary balance between the rights of travellers , their security and , above all , the safety of air travel against these new terrorist challenges that threaten everyone in Europe , and indeed in the greater world . #% Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region , in the North-West of England , are eagerly awaiting this legislation . #% I believe the Red Cross should be given immediate access to detainees , international monitors should be introduced and arbitrary detention must be brought to an end . #% Mr President , on behalf of my group and as a very , very proud Irishwoman , I would like to pay tribute to John Hume and to say how pleased and delighted we are that he finally received his just reward and recognition with award of the Nobel Prize , both to himself and to David Trimble . #% The deadlines set under various articles are too short . #% That requires more urgency before we move on to the direct tax agenda . #% I would like to make a special reference to the people of Ireland . #% Article 75 of the Treaty of Maastricht introduced the legal basis for the introduction of Community measures to improve the level of transport safety in Europe , thereby creating a Community competence in this field . #% Thirdly , temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity . #% I believe that the Summit will make a significant difference in key areas such as water and energy . #% It was a totally horrendous programme , although I agree social exclusion is a major factor in these dreadful occurrences . #% I support you also , Madam President , in making space on Thursday 's agenda for a debate on this tragedy . #% It is a political question about European solidarity with Member States such as Denmark and Holland and not in fact , strictly speaking , about human rights in China at all . #% 
It seems to me that is a mistake . #% It remains to be seen whether its medium - and long-term measures will be any better . #% This will immediately mean more controls and inspections and less time for the farmer to tend his stock . #% Dublin Airport Authority ( DAA ) has tendered a contract , worth up to EUR 2 million , for body scanners at Dublin airport . #% The Irish Government is insisting that a network of waste incinerators , some for toxic waste , be created in my country , thus introducing an explosion of PAHs into our water , air , soil , plants and into the cells of Irish citizens where the benzenes and dioxins can wreak havoc . #% This aspect of the fisheries sector is the poor relation that has been ignored for far too long . #% An IGC is very important as institutional reform must take place before the practical process of enlargement can succeed and much work needs to be done to prepare EU Institutions for this intergovernmental phase . #% But it is not the panacea to all consumer disputes . #% I do not know how someone living in the Dark Ages , who believes in military blocs , global militarization and imperialism can be considered a visionary . #% Mr President , I have no difficulty with the sensible exchange of information about criminal convictions between Member States , but only the politically blind could fail to recognise the proposals in the Costa report as part of the harmonisation process that is under way in the criminal justice system across Europe . #% Madam President , today we again debate human rights across the world and point out the deficiencies of others . #% Mr President , there is concern surrounding the recent agreement reached on the reform of the common agricultural policy : certain agricultural changes could come about as a result of the World Trade Organisation talks . #% In the Middle Ages half the population of Europe was destroyed . #% We have to consider the ethics of promising one thing and doing something different . #% If we want to be realistic about being the most dynamic then we must take tough decisions to reflect that position . #% If we can not work out the levels of commitment and lay down rules with proper conditions between Parliament , Commission and Council , we run the risk of failing to meet the target and the necessity for reform . #% It has come to my attention that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has applied to the British Department of the Environment for authorisation to discharge high levels of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea in the near future . #% Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia , I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its lack of self-sufficiency regarding protein crops . #% Finally , we need to carefully evaluate all applications because it is crucial that assistance is made available as quickly and efficiently as possible . #% I appreciate her call for an increased role for fishermen in the decision-making process and the emphasis that she has put on conservation of fish stocks and environmental considerations . #% It is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the European Union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families . #% I support the extension of the mandate of Europol to investigate money laundering matters . #% Lastly , at a time when we rightly seek to inform people of the dangers of tobacco and to reduce tobacco use , it seems illogical to me that we would seek to legislate for the liberalisation of drugs . #% If that were the case , it would be economically unviable for transporters to have such a vehicle . #% It is a display of contempt for the Members of this House for the Council to seek simply to push aside important questions which individual Members may want to raise . #% I , like most of my colleagues , am an ardent supporter of the aims of the Socrates programme and have witnessed its benefits to education and to local communities . #% But precisely because of these potential programming delays it is important that in Parliament 's priorities the idea of transitional programmes are the same length for all objectives : six years to allow regions coming off regional aid adequate time to put into place self-sustaining programmes by using financial opportunities of loans and venture capital . #% Madam President , I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman , Mr Tomlinson , the committee , and indeed the staff who have worked so hard on this particular report . #% You have said that you can see advantages and disadvantages in the convention method and I am aware that many in the Council would share that view . #% I am also directly concerned with the effects of reprocessing on neighbouring states , such as my own , where radioactive contamination from Sellafield has been found on the east coast beaches , in particular Carlingford Lough , where I grew up . #% I agree with the rapporteur that this interim report is something of a distraction , but an important one just the same , because it will awaken Members of this House to the importance of detail . #% On the issue of committing troops to UNIFIL II , some EU countries have been generous to date . #% We must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat . #% A higher rate would mean a higher cut in direct payments and therefore in farm incomes . #% This is one part of the European research area . #% What is a fact , and what surprises many people , is that because of the level of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere , we are already committed to a significant amount of global warming and rising sea levels . #% Other alternatives can be looked at and a special fund set up to keep us up to speed with what is happening in America in that regard . #% I welcome the strong support from EU governments for closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs . #% The Commission , in the review of the structural funds , must give consideration to the various regional imbalances . #% Fléchard took the Irish government to court and won an injunction preventing the Irish government from taking the EUR 17 million . #% It has been very interesting to hear so much consensus this morning . #% I suppose in many ways these can be divided up into four separate yet linked areas . #% Mr President , I am somebody who generally supports the Common Agricultural Policy , so I hate to admit this in front of Terry Wynn , but I agree with some of the points he makes about the complications of the policy which have led to so many opportunities for fraud . #% Integrated coastal zone management initiatives usually focus on a central coordinating mechanism which requires comparatively low levels of core funding . #% This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the so-called protection of consumers against gambling excesses . #% Are we going to have it before next week ? #% I saw a report at one time which said that we could increase the catch from European waters by 50 % if we would apply the conservation measures necessary . #% In many Member States including my own , farmers and rural dwellers do not enjoy the same levels of broadband access , putting them at a distinct disadvantage in comparison with people who live in cities and towns . #% Such action shall cover the fight against the major health scourges by improving research into the causes , their transmission and prevention , as well as health information and education . #% However , when one considers that there was over 42 million tonnes of waste in Ireland in 1995 I am confident that the innovative proposals to deal with waste management in Ireland will receive a very favourable response from the Commission during the next round of European Union structural funding for the years 2000 to 2006 . #% What they all share is a desire to achieve political ends through anti-democratic efforts . #% Many citizens are critical of nuclear power and the non-nuclear states have a right not to be polluted by emissions from nuclear states , such as those in the Irish Sea from Sellafield , now much increased by THORP . #% Two years ago I wrote to Commissioner Mario Monti renewing my call for a study . #% It means corporations installing facilities like incinerators , because Ireland has been marked as being good for that . #% Nobody has absolute confidence that anybody else is carrying out the supervision and enforcing the law as they should and we will end up in the same situation with this agreement . #% Climate change is one of the top priorities for Europe , as well as for the rest of the world . #% This is an area which has to be looked at in the months ahead - we must create the confidence within ourselves that we can begin to move forward as we begin , hopefully , to see the back of the TSE/BSE problem . #% In tonight 's motion , we are calling ` on the leadership of Sinn Féin to insist that those responsible for the murder and the witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with the PSNI and be free from the threat of reprisals from the IRA ' , or indeed to cooperate with the Ombudsman of Northern Ireland . #% We must engage in a wholehearted and unrelenting attack on these threats to our society . #% First of all I would say that anything that we decide in a democratic way , through the institutions of the Union , about own resources , is what own resources are . #% Eventually , when we were listened to , we found that instrument . #% The financial services sector has become very sophisticated at risk management and so the regulatory framework has to respond to the times . #% It is essential that beef farmers are shown the maximum consideration . #% There was torture , murder , imprisonment , kidnapping , coercion and blackmail , affecting people in Chile and in our countries . #% Now it is being promoted by democratic states . #% However , despite these concerns , I have voted in favour of the report and I congratulate the rapporteur . #% 
Isolation in Europe would only bring economic uncertainty to our country , which has a high level of inward investment comprising hundreds of thousands of jobs . #% I deplore the proposed cutbacks by the European Council in funding for SMEs at a time when this is supposed to be a central plank in the EU 's action to combat unemployment . #% Mr President , I would like to use this short speech to call for the immediate reactivation of the Ferries Directive , which was allowed to lapse after the Council of Ministers failed to agree on its implementation . #% Can I ask you specifically whether the debate on the services directive in the Council over the next couple of months will be open to the public , and whether the decisions made by the Member States individually will be available to the public ? #% I also believe that the European Union could do a lot more . #% The Commission has decided that the time for action is now , and I endorse this view . #% As I have just said , the Council has not received a Commission proposal and if we do the Council will certainly act on such a proposal . #% We should be prepared to take time to make that assessment . #% Mr President , I wish to draw the attention of this House to a very practical matter that is specifically of concern to Irish beef farmers , but that touches at the very heart of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reforms . #% I have one negative point to say to Chancellor Schroeder . #% After immigrants , we take on the gypsies , then citizens we do not like the look of . #% In my own experience as chairman of group C , examining some of the Latin American countries , I have to say that the cooperation has been very good . #% I believe that agriculture and a strong , well resourced common agricultural policy are central to this objective . #% The European Union 's relationship with both the African Union and the Southern African Development Community has been damaged by African states ' insistence that banned Zimbabweans should be included in meetings in Europe . #% I am quite convinced that some of these actors think we do not mean what we say . #% I regret very much the apparent absence of the Council of Ministers , although I may be wrong , from this important debate . #% I would imagine that it will take at least a doubling of the present structural funds to finance a new regional policy for the new and wider Europe if we are not to create immense dissatisfaction in the countries which join and if we are not to alienate many of the citizens already in the Community . #% We also have the environmental impact on our air quality . #% This represents another step in the important work of rebuilding the confidence of European consumers in the quality and safety of European food products - as the Commissioner has often said - ` from farm to fork ' . #% Similarly , today we are spending about the same amount of money on the policy as we spent 15 years ago , but only half the number of farmers are involved . #% People often talk of European Union as economic this and economic that , but fundamentally , as I have often said on my streets , it is the finest example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% It is very important that the market for fish in the EU is reformed and consolidated . #% I also thank the scientific community , which was not slow in giving us advice and in pointing out that its needs were for simplicity , faster administration and financial care . #% Mr President , I am very alarmed that no real effort has been made to act on the experiences that the UK had during the devastating outbreak of foot and mouth . #% I agree with the proposer of the motion that this is most urgent and should be discussed here immediately . #% Well , here it is , sticking its nose over the horizon ; it 's time for you to prove your mettle . #% Finally , I think that if we have a level playing field and if we end the subsidies particularly for nuclear energy , we will see the other forms of energy coming forward . #% Madam President , before we finish the debate I should like to bring to the House 's attention the many women whose children have been abducted to countries where these women have no rights whatsoever before the courts . #% However , the scourge of AIDS is robbing many developing countries of their finest young people . #% Given the current crisis in the beef industry , it would be better to avoid further reforms at least until we have mastered the present crisis . #% I support the enlargement of the Union , but such a process can not take place until key EU institutions , including the Commission , the Council , and of course Parliament , reform their internal decision-making operations . #% There is no way around this . #% After a time of great anguish and pain in our country , these are the good days , John , and thank God you are there to enjoy them and to enjoy the tributes from your friends and colleagues and your countrywomen and men at this particular time in your life . #% Tony Blair ' s wonderful new government , with its ethical foreign policy , has continued sending its arms to Indonesia . #% Mr President , I too want to sympathize with the relatives of the fisherman who was drowned off the south coast of Ireland in a collision which took place on Sunday . #% We recommend an examination of the use of living wills across European borders , which are so badly needed . #% We must also try to ensure that , in so doing , we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater . #% Mr Stevenson is too young to remember the cod wars which were fought around the coast of Iceland in my lifetime - in fact , at a time when I was already in politics . #% The Commission judgment was simply wrong and the Commission has yet to explain the future policy direction for the low-cost airline sector in Europe . #% I agree with all those who said that this business of reform must be finished before the next European election because then there will be a new Parliament , a new Europe after enlargement and a new Commission . #% And if he uses his stubbornness to refuse to dialogue with us , if we have difficulties in the hearings , that is a stubbornness we will oppose . #% As far as research and development is concerned , let me be positive . #% I think our care for the children involved is central to it , and that must be the beginning and the end of this debate . #% What are we to make of the fact that this investigation by the UK Nuclear Inspectorate resulted from a press report in the UK Independent , following which the UK Government sent in a posse , as it were - the Nuclear Inspectorate . #% Many people in the European Union are trying to tackle the issue of landfill sites situated near homes or the fact that incinerators are being planned in some countries , including my own to try to deal with the waste problem . #% Consequently , the Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised by the authorities closest to the citizens . #% Mr President , I voted against this report on the Nice Treaty , but I found it ironic that my colleagues from the main political establishment parties in Ireland , who criticised the no-campaign in Ireland saying we have no grounds for criticism , endorsed a report today which is extremely critical of the Nice Treaty . #% People are refusing to accept that there are drug addicts out there , that there are people suffering from drug addiction and that something must be done to ensure that these people are protected and that they are not criminalized . #% I do not think that is acceptable . #% We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic . #% I believe we must have access to the single market . #% There is no point in carrying out research to find out what pollution is related to pollution-related diseases , and what is causing pollution-related diseases , if these findings are only going to be put on a shelf and nothing done about them . #% In contrast to a colleague , Mr Busk , who has just spoken , I do not have problems with vaccinated animals entering the food chain . #% Is the President-in-Office aware of the continuing concern of people , in particular on Ireland 's east coast , about the safety of the accident-prone Sellafield plant ? #% However , we can welcome the first sentence ` to list the Great White Shark in CITES Appendix II ' . #% This would symbolise the added value of working together in the EU on society ' s wishes and needs . #% I want also to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her regular attendance at our meetings and for the help and expertise that her staff provided . #% The European Union has not been ignoring this worrying phenomenon . #% in writing . - I would like to commend my colleagues in the Agricultural Committee for this initiative report . #% The effect on prices during the recent dairy crisis is just one example . #% There is an urgent need to integrate planning and management and promote collaborative working of marine and terrestrial assistance at local , regional and national levels . #% In my opinion , the Swedish Presidency did not seem to have the facility to have any meaningful negotiations on the matter . #% Celtic Tiger Ireland should be a success story for all the Irish people , and yet we remain one of the most unequal societies not just in the EU but in fact globally . #% While I would stress that US toy safety legislation on testing requirements and standards is weaker than the European Union 's , and their problems with defective toys were greater , nonetheless the recalls for the same product occurred in July in the US and it took Member States until September to take action to withdraw defective toy products from the market in the EU . #% What about political fundamentalism , or cultural or environmental fundamentalism ? #% For those of us who feel forced to stand and watch helplessly , Pope John Paul II , one of the world 's greatest leaders , who has consistently reached out to the Muslim community , has asked us to fast and pray for a speedy end to this war . #% 
So we need to have a worldwide environmental strategy with an impact assessment because the environment is worldwide . #% My group was also able to support the agreement in trialogue and I think it has found a good compromise . #% On behalf of Mr Poettering , the leader of the PPE-DE Group , on my own behalf , and particularly on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation , I would like to pledge our fullest support to them in their courageous , dignified and determined pursuit of justice for their brother Robert 's brutal murder . #% It is difficult to keep a focus and priority on the need for generosity and rapid relief , as we almost become conditioned to natural disaster after natural disaster . #% It is a language of the Court of Justice and of the European Schools . #% Since scientists first started saving flu virus samples in the early 20th century , an H5N1 influenza has never spread among human beings , so population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus would be universal . #% The adoption of this strategy will allow for cost-effective , value-added development of new and innovative solutions , and so I supported this proposal . #% What is happening here is that the Commission and others are bowing to the pressures of industry . #% The idea of Amendment No 36 was that the registry should adopt terms and conditions to incorporate an accredited code of conduct for online trading and therefore give businesses the opportunity to join an accredited online extra-judicial dispute resolution scheme . #% However , it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward . #% There is a need for us to address the question of funding of pensions . #% What mandate , if any , has the Council given the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the European Union in relation to the United Nations Convention on People with Disabilities ? #% In relation to the proposed compensation package I would say to the Commissioner that payment should be fast and efficient . #% I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow . #% EU citizens demanded we take action to keep the products of the cruel commercial hunt out of the EU . #% So that information to this House was wrong . #% Were he to be expelled on a technicality , as an act of solidarity I would wish to be expelled with him . #% Every effort must be made to put in place the Compromise reached at Davos which will allow for a copper-fastening of EU-South African relations . #% That is one of the major problems . #% This has a two-fold effect . #% This fifth Irish presidency takes place at a time when the Union is facing exceptional challenges , including the preparations for economic and monetary union and for enlargement and the revision of the treaties . #% This display of lawlessness at the highest level of government is unacceptable in a Union based on the rule of law and solidarity . #% Madam President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the production of this report . #% in writing . - Over the last number of days , Ireland has been struck by severe flooding causing devastation for ordinary families , for small businesses and for farmers across the island . #% The short-sighted and narrow economic outlook of the Irish Government , which disregarded workers ' rights and entitlements in favour of maximising profits has led to a situation in which 543 workers on Irish Ferries face redundancy and replacement by workers earning less than 50 % of the Irish minimum wage . #% It is now up to the Member States ' governments to take the initiative provided by this report , and I urge the Dutch presidency to examine this issue as a matter of some urgency . #% When you are up there you seem to just look at the front and the centre . #% Mr President-in-Office , you were intrigued by the questioner . #% I support respecting the sovereignty of the Afghan people , but the Karzai regime is corrupt and does not reflect the interests of the majority of the Afghan people . #% The EU and ACP must reaffirm their partnership by strengthening democracy and respect for human rights , especially the rights of women . #% Would he also accept - and I agree with his point about the strategic importance of Pakistan in the region , especially at this critical time - that failed states , abuse of human rights and abuse of democracy are the very things that feed terrorism ? #% In conclusion , I urge all Members to support this and to give more hope for the future of the European Union . #% Madam President , in my previous contribution to this debate , I acknowledged the importance of carefully managed genetic research and its role in meeting the challenge of world food production and maintaining the commercial viability of family farming . #% That is why we ascribe and subscribe to the International Criminal Court . #% It also provides means to reduce animal testing and child labour . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question in relation to this important issue that is before us today : would he look also at the Scotch-Irish language in Northern Ireland ? #% Certainly , what is happening does not reflect the European aspiration to unity . #% It is also important that we avoid excessive horizontalism in an approach to this , and I believe that perhaps the first draft that we looked at the outset was excessively so . #% Commissioner Fischler contends that his decoupling proposals will reduce production and therefore increase prices , but this ignores the reality of the Commission 's World Trade proposals of a decrease of up to 36 % in import tariffs amongst other multilateral issues . #% The Simpson report strikes the balance between improving the present service levels and ensuring that a universal service can be offered to all the citizens of the European Union , irrespective of where they live . #% Again my thanks go to the rapporteur and to all colleagues for their particular understanding . #% author . - Mr President , I support calls for the end of the death penalty in China , more especially when the death penalty is used to terrorise minority ethnic groups and nations within the Chinese state . #% I do not believe the Commission can , on the one hand , say we must open up access to the Irish Box and , on the other , preach conservation and protection of fish in other areas . #% The combined effects of this directive and the Water Framework Directive will make the Nitrates Directive wholly superfluous . #% This subject is , of course , closely linked with maintaining the strictest controls to ensure protection of our seas from environmental damage by shipping . #% They are more interested in securing their position in the World Trade Organization than they are in securing the position in the World Bank to pursue the objectives of the Union . #% Just last month , Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which , in his view , is workable , sustainable and legally secure , because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO . #% The first concerns the very important amendment tabled by my colleague Mr Piétrasanta in committee . #% Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving . #% The European Union showed real leadership , supported to a large extent by the candidate countries , the G77 and China . #% People in need of such temporary action do not necessarily meet the conditions of refugee status under the terms of the Geneva Convention . #% Even our colleague Mr Cunha 's proposal for decoupling male beef but not sucklers in my country , Ireland , must come with a health warning , as it will collapse the price of calves and weanlings . #% This Parliament has to call for a number of things : recognition of Alzheimer 's disease as a major health scourge within the meaning of Article 129 of the Treaty ; establishment of an action programme to combat Alzheimer 's disease and related disorders within the priorities of the new Community public health programme ; recognition of the important role played by family care givers , Alzheimer 's Europe and their national member organizations ; and finally , the establishment of a European network and support for existing networks working with people with Alzheimer 's . #% The development of high-speed trains has to be welcomed ; it should not be stopped . #% I note from the figures that the cost per tonne seems to have gone down . #% I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned . #% I would ask the Commissioner to take on board the compromise suggested by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which gets the balance right in this area , because the Commission proposal has caused major problems in many countries , particularly the UK and Ireland . #% I want to place on record my thanks to the outgoing Commission because in all the heated debates we have had nobody has stopped to thank those members of the Commission who have worked very hard for the people of Europe , the people we all here tried to represent . #% Mr President , I am from Ireland . #% I know it is very complicated and difficult , but very rarely do we hear any details of what is happening on the ground in these parts of the world and how we are tackling the serious problem of children with HIV and AIDS . #% I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion . #% Mr President , the continued increase in air traffic , which is expected to double over the next decade , is placing unprecedented pressure on air travel safety . #% Why not battle groups ? #% The directive allows a 20-year period for countries which landfill more than 80 % of their waste to come into line . #% According to the latest available data , 31.5 % of employed women work part-time compared with only 8.3 % of employed men . #% I would like this House to urge the participants to please come together and hold those elections as soon as feasible . #% 
We should be very concerned that only half of cases are estimated to have been diagnosed . #% It is necessary to maintain and enhance these practices by improving the possibilities for fallowing , to allow the sites used for fish farming to be totally rested and flushed . #% Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency . #% The Greek Government tried valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe , but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts , this objective could not be secured . #% Mr President , I support the rapporteur 's position . #% Indeed , they have been able to tailor insurance provision to the socio-economic characteristics of populations in an informal economy which remain excluded from formal schemes and commercial insurance , and , as a result , they are an appropriate solution for achieving the goal of universal coverage in low - and middle-income countries . #% The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated . #% Like the previous report , this is a very timely reminder to us as we consider the fifth framework programme of the rationale for doing research in the European Union . #% In relation to truck drivers , it seems to me that the only way to regulate this is to put it into law . #% I would argue too that the notion that social security is simply a safety net needs to be avoided and that in reforming our social security systems we have to give particular attention to eliminating poverty traps . #% I wish it every success in doing so . #% I come from a country where we have the fewest forests in the European Union . #% First , the retention of effective national control over taxation policy is a matter to which the Irish Government and other European governments have consistently attached the highest importance . #% To that end every insurance undertaking operating within the European Union must now appoint a representative within each Member State to be responsible for settling claims on its behalf if an accident occurs involving an EU national . #% However , I would suggest to this House today that , as the people of Northern Ireland see some 200 convicted terrorists released on the streets , without any effort on the part of the terrorists to hand in their weapons , it as a democratic parliament would want to lend its voice in support of those who want to support the democratic way , and urge them to do it democratically , hand in their weapons and rid us of the plague of terrorism on both sides of the divide . #% Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources , the practice of direct dumping with little thought to the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable . #% That being the case , if products are not available in the EU from a voluntary and non-remunerated supply , we should not prevent products being imported from outside the EU for the protection of human health and the delivery of services to people in need . #% If the Commission is taking legal action against Member States it would seem that the interests or the protection of Member States are given priority by the Commission and that we basically end up with a situation where citizens throughout the European Union are going to be accusing the Commission of being extremely secretive and protecting the interests of the Member States . #% Body scanners are not infallible but they are the best technology available at present and so we need to use what tools we have to hand in order to reduce the terrorist threat . #% We will not defeat terrorism , whether it be national terrorism , whether it be driven by fundamentalism of any kind , unless we do battle with the ideas that underpin that terror . #% It is larger than the entire quota that an island nation like Ireland gets . #% So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money . #% These two services go hand in hand and can not be separated . #% In so doing , we must ensure that we show the deepest respect to the different religious traditions in this country and to this ancient civilisation which has contributed so much to the world . #% In Ireland , we have gone from 65 % dependency on imported energy in 1990 to over 90 % dependency today , and rising . #% Are we going to start introducing Schengen agreements for bees , birds and the wind and also ensure that we do not have any kind of cross-pollination ? #% I very much welcome the announcement today by the ETA organisation . #% They fly flags of convenience and then , when they break the rules , Member States , for example Spain , turn around and say : ' Oh , well , it was flying a British flag ' , when the reality is that it was a Spanish-owned vessel . #% We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort . #% The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the responsibilities of parents in providing the proper care and attention to their children , as well as the child 's right to receive this care , guidance , and love . #% However , we must make this shift carefully and think of all the ramifications . #% Let us bring everyone on board and let the industry be listened to and , above all , take on board some of its very good ideas . #% We must have independence within this part of the world in this very important sector . #% This follows Ireland 's endorsement of the European Charter on alcohol of the World Health Organization 's Paris conference last December . #% Secondly will the Spanish presidency guarantee that it will put equal access and equal rights for all disabled people in the European Union at the top of the agenda ? #% However , I strongly disagree with the ideas of right-wing political Islam and of Hamas . #% As a newly elected MEP I too have difficulties with this Institution , so I share the problems that the citizens have . #% We should all recall that the primary motive of organised crime is financial gain . #% Colleagues have referred to the European security and defence policy . #% His experience at the highest political levels over the years in matters European renders his views particularly important . #% The best-placed people to do this and present what is needed are people with disabilities themselves . #% The political reality is that if we do not get a qualified majority for legal base Article 175 tomorrow -- and we need a qualified majority for a second reading -- the common position will remain : the dual legal base . #% This is a process that I am sure will be continued and deepened by our friends in the Belgian Presidency . #% Would the flexibility foreseen for small artisanal slaughterhouses be defined by marketing only regionally as a result of requiring the presence of official veterinarians during every slaughter process ? #% I certainly hope that the end result of all this legislation is to increase the responsibility of food business operators both in primary production and in subsequent stages of production . #% If you are trying to keep the link between Parliament , Commission , Council and the people , you must try hard to get a quick solution to this . #% We can do it if we wish . #% As a final point , all those who fear that the EU is facing an identity crisis at the moment should take heart from this report . #% These are fundamental to an open market . #% I want to follow in a similar vein to the previous speaker . #% Personally , I am adamant that the rural economy , SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals . #% It is a testament to their abilities and initiatives that there was such overwhelming support for the positions that they took . #% I know that Mr Titley is a lobbyist for what I would call ` the merchants of death ' . #% Mr President , in wishing the Greek Presidency well , I appeal to it to make every effort to address the grave problem of falling farm incomes . #% EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities , such as the rebuilding of basic social infrastructure , including health , education , water and sanitation services . #% Their best is to make money for their investors -- that is what corporations do -- and all the rest of their activities are part of this , be it a question of medical services , food or cars . #% As an Irish Member of the European Parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in 15 years from the weakest in the EU to one of the strongest , I wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the ` Celtic Tiger ' . #% . -- Mr President , this report deals with the Commission 's review of the multi-annual guidance programmes . #% So we will vote against this amendment and in favour of the original recital . #% The collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities , such as those we have seen in Madrid . #% in writing . - As part of the European Economic Recovery Plan , an extra $ 1 billion has been earmarked for the development of broadband internet infrastructure in rural areas via the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development . #% It is not enough for us to wring our hands , it is not enough for Member States , as Mr Hughes has pointed out , to oppose the temporary agency workers directive - which provides some degree of security for certain categories of workers - and then pretend that they are going to do something serious about pensions , when in fact they are undermining the possibility for many thousands of people to have sufficient contributions , even for a State pension . #% Discussion of regionalism at Singapore has already been called for by a number of World Trade Organization members and will probably be discussed there . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his clear and concise introduction to what is a complex , emotive and difficult piece of legislation . #% We believe that this is unfair . #% I believe that the EU can make a further contribution today . #% 
The real difficulty is that we have no forum , as Members of this democratically elected assembly , where we can discuss our concerns and fears , be they real or perceived , and agree or disagree amongst ourselves in a democratic way on this issue . #% We stand today at a new frontier , the dawn of a new era , when the old visions of Europe have been broken down , when countries that were denied the opportunities to have democracy and representation are being given that opportunity now . #% In the Commission 's proposal there was a technical omission under Article 2 , dealing with the transposition of the proposal . #% The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes . #% If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe , on the evidence to date , that this Commission is a reformist Commission . #% I am appealing to you on behalf of the people who are trying to produce the food . #% The horrors of Algeria and the lack of response from the government in Algeria to an independent human rights Commission to visit Algeria to see what is happening there is something that should also be raised . #% They also want to hear their own stories told in their own way on their own national channels . #% Likewise , I found it particularly distasteful and very hard to watch the media coverage of a minority element at some of those demonstrations who were inflicting pain on themselves , especially young people . #% Mr President , I congratulate Mr Trakatellis on the report . #% In fact , the European Union can play a very significant role in disseminating best practices through what we have achieved in the Union itself . #% Anything less would be damaging to the public interest and no less damaging to the ultimate sustainability of a proper public service capacity within the Union . #% There is still clearly a problem there and if we are serious about addressing a 60 % participation of women in the labour market , we have to address the question of equal pay in the review that is being carried out by the Commission . #% We want child pornography on news groups blocked . #% The next 20 years will probably see an increase of around 80 % in the quantities of PVC waste because of the increase in the average lifespan of certain PVC products such as window frames . #% Their attitude is based on the simple belief that implementing restrictive environmental protection either harms their business activities or increases their financial overheads significantly . #% The problems of the industry have built up a great degree of resentment . #% This will ultimately serve to increase our competitiveness and strengthen the economy in rural areas . #% At the same time , it contributes to a reduction in the amount of beef produced . #% We all know that , to rise to the challenge of energy saving , it is important that consumers both in the public and private sectors acknowledge and see the benefits which directly engaging with energy-saving initiatives can bring both in environmental and economic terms , but I will give you a warning because there has been an example in my own Member State of gold-plating the directive , particularly in the requirements for energy performance certificates in public buildings , and this has added , in some cases , extra bureaucratic costs with little perceived energy saving and led to a loss of public support ; that is regrettable . #% It is very important to engage local communities in groups , outside the institutional level of the current peace talks . #% Farmers who in good faith were working to the stipulated deadline are quite clearly disadvantaged . #% The other point I wish to make relates to the clause which appears to facilitate the Atlantic Dawn . #% Do not listen to people who are creating obstacles . #% Open trade - yes , but only with rules . #% But , regrettably , politics is not exact and we are here today discussing a measure which is more practical than ideal . #% This is particularly the case with China , and we have named a whole series of people involved . #% Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Sierra Leone and China . #% I speak from my own limited experience in that area , which I shall relate at another time and in another place . #% Statehood properly lies in nation states and that is where it should remain . #% The whole concept is an actual farce because the results of these ` peaceful ' explosions can easily be used to develop weapons of war . #% in writing . - I voted against the proposals to discharge the Commission of its obligation to report on its expenditure because the report was unclear . #% However , how do we ensure that this is the case ? #% That is the biggest disincentive to investment which will hit job opportunities . #% I know some of your constituents , Mr President , suffered the same experience . #% Morocco is not recognised as the administrative power . #% Finally , since Mrs McCarthy has referred to her region , I can not resist referring to my own region and the importance of the film business there at the moment . #% The extent of the pressure which can be put on politicians is known to us all and can be seen in the results of the annual Council meeting where TACs are decided . #% Mr President , I particularly want to thank Mrs McCarthy for her work on this difficult report . #% The Council of Europe , in its report Coherent and Integrated Family Policies , states , `` Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values , standards , customs and behaviour of the social groups to which their children belong '' . #% The EU must also continue to promote an international code of conduct . #% I can understand why you would have to take a head count . #% I should also like to inform my colleague , Mr Stubb , that there was more than one group leader in the Chamber for the duration of the debate . #% So , we might ask why the Commission is proposing to admit 75 or 100 million very poor people without any expansion of the resources of the Union . #% Is it really ideal , if we are setting precedents , that the European Parliament should contemplate a debate at 5.30 p.m. on a Thursday , which if it is anything like the 5.30 p.m. debate I attended on the Thursday of the January part-session , is not to be recommended as a time for setting precedents . #% References to the struggle against fascism fall particularly ill from the lips of a President , one of whose predecessors expressed condolences upon the death of Hitler . #% That really is what the debate is about in this House today . #% A two-speed Europe already exists in at least two areas : namely the Schengen Agreement and the single currency . #% This situation can not continue . #% It was never a comfortable directive . #% I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work , but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers . #% Turning to the Watson report , we all agree on the need for cooperation and coordination in combating terrorism . #% In other words , the issues of the efficient running of enterprises are as pertinent in western , developed market economies as they are in developing countries . #% The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States . #% You can provide state aids that are untouchable , even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself ! #% in writing . - I would ask fellow MEPs to imagine for a moment that they are in business . #% I would appreciate the fact if my name could be included among those who were present . #% Whether one looked at telecoms , post office services , water supplies and so on , there was this idea of universality . #% On the other hand , the Irish Exchequer obtains over EUR 800 million annually from VRT , this equates to a 2 % increase in the standard rate of income tax and indicates the problems that would ensue if VRT were to be reduced or abolished . #% In conclusion , I believe that efficient , cheap and sustainable energy production is a key element in achieving our goal . #% The European Union can play a major role in solving conflict resolution in the different parts of the world by sending to those areas of conflict not an army but a philosophy of peace based on firm principles . #% in writing . - The incoming Swedish Presidency has many challenges but the greatest is the need to ensure that the EU respects the sovereignty of the Member States and does not ride roughshod over the democratic rights of the peoples of Europe . #% The first steps of the new DCI framework are being taken and we all have responsibilities to get it right . #% We also have a common line among the committees : the rapporteurs in the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - respectively responsible for instruments for cooperation with industrialised countries and instruments for human rights and democracy - have adopted the very same approach as I have . #% I am aware of the rule which states that the President ' s ruling on votes shall be final . #% As everyone knows , environmental issues cross all boundaries . #% 
However , further measures are required , including restrictions on the length of gear and measures to prevent the stripping and dumping of nets at sea . #% However , as regards the issues in this report , as we have said , by and large we agree with much of the proposal . #% It is quite clear that we are setting up a military superstate within the EU with its own arms industry . #% We have relied very much on the leadership of the Commission to push this as a political issue in our country . #% That is why I commend my amendment to you . #% There should be proper codes of conduct and proper measures brought in to ensure that this kind of thing can not happen . #% It is quite clear that there is a lack of political will there , and something has to be done about it . #% The point of order I wanted to make - even though the issue is no longer relevant - is that in your interpretation of the rules , a Member need only announce his attendance and not participate at the start of a vote . #% Technical conservation measures will play an important role in the conservation of stocks by protecting juvenile fish and will reduce the threat to further yields . #% I congratulate Mrs de Esteban Martin on the immense work she has put into it but I think that when it comes to voting we will either have to abstain or vote against because of the complexity . #% There is no doubt in my mind that the same individuals involved in this trade are also involved in drugs and other such activities . #% This , we believe , is the new direction for Europe . #% If not , why not , if we are serious about exerting serious economic pressure ? #% I also want to congratulate you , Mr Spring , on your success last week with regard to ending the impasse on the MEDA programme . #% We also need new sustainable technologies . #% We should now proceed to give it teeth . #% For it is all very well to support peace and the role of the UN , but we must do this actively - if not , we risk contributing to the suffering of the Sudanese people . #% It is impossible to comply with and when the animals leave the EU it is impossible to monitor them . #% Mrs Doyle 's point on infants is a really serious question because infant formula is being mixed with water that has been fluoridated , and I believe that there are serious consequences for children here . #% Only in this way can fishermen contribute to and influence Community policy . #% However , I am pleased that the PEACE programme is being extended and would be grateful for strong support for this symbol of EU commitment to all the people of Northern Ireland . #% A programme on BBC World Television last Monday night emphasized the point again that 82 % of all crime in Britain is drugs-related . #% I raised myself afterwards the question of the soundness of my voting card . #% A clinical clean-up operation -- which took some time , I might add -- was then ordered by local IRA leaders . #% In most of these situations it must be said that timely action by the international community based upon assessments and early warnings of situations could undoubtedly have saved many lives and greatly reduced human suffering and misery . #% We should also recall that America , like all EU countries , has signed up to international conventions protecting human rights and against torture . #% With regard to a proposal for four industry representatives on the board , it would be helpful for the Commission to clarify that the various sectors of the maritime industry would be represented . #% The precautionary approach should mean that before any stock can be fished on a commercial basis there must be , at the very least , a scientific assessment of the stock and a conservatively-based total allowable catch . #% in writing . - I welcome the fact that the new Directive 2009/48/EC on toy safety will come into force in 2011 , although it is regrettable that the directive will not be in force for the Christmas 2010 period next year , when the majority of toys made or imported into the EU , are sold . #% One really does wonder whether there is an appreciation of the dire jeopardy in which agriculture in many regions like mine , with which you are familiar , is now being placed if that is the process that is to be followed . #% To overcome this , Members have suggested that we bring in differential tax incentives to give encouragement and so on . #% Her Majesty 's Customs and Excise have been able to cut the cross-Channel bootlegging of tobacco by an impressive 76 % since March 2000 . #% Increased profit and market control by multinationals has been at the expense of small family farms . #% It is going to be very difficult to look after the animals if the rest period is on the vehicle . #% However , as those speakers have mentioned , very little progress has been made on this , partially because of the unanimity requirement under Article 99 but also because of a lack of action on behalf of the Commission and other institutions to force out the boat with regard to giving proper representation to the true ideals of the single market . #% deputising for the author . - I just wish to say that I understand that there is a cross-over here between the different rules . #% The European Community is optimally positioned to combat transnational health problems , such as the threat posed by epidemics of infectious diseases and food-related incidences . #% Through its actions today , the European Parliament , in sending once again a message of goodwill to Sri Lanka , is also expressing its wish for the President and the Prime Minister to work together in the national interest . #% So where did the Structural Funds go ? #% Those elections were witnessed by a delegation of the European Parliament and I wish to thank the authorities for the kindness and hospitality extended to all its members . #% Commissioner Nielson must come to this House and explain his use of PR men and spin doctors in this disgraceful display of neglect . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to convey a very warm and hearty welcome to the Irish Minister for European Affairs on this , his first visit to a plenary session of the European Parliament . #% Any agreement on concentration must include a firm commitment to proper transitional arrangements . #% I hope he will forgive my forthrightness because this is an important question . #% They want to support the young producers and directors who are making these programmes , very often grossly under-financed . #% In all agreements with third countries the European Union must continue to press for the inclusion of specific human rights clauses . #% This EU legislation aims to move us closer to becoming a recycling society . #% Madam President , one would expect nothing less from somebody like Mrs Roth , whom I consider an extraordinary individual . #% As a Community of 25 members , the Union is now in a much stronger position than ever to promote policies on the international stage with vigour and determination . #% Failure to do this would be a dereliction of duty and we must insist on the right of Member States to continue the policy . #% Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings . #% Not only are the interests of the patients afforded insufficient attention but also the carers of these patients are in many cases totally ignored . #% Hence I welcome the resistance at last Friday 's Council of Ministers meeting to a further surrender of the national veto . #% That is not sufficient to ensure the animals ' welfare and the scientists have actually pointed this out . #% Things will not be the same after 11 September , as many others have said . #% These are the values which have brought peace , prosperity and freedom to our continent , and it is only right and fitting that we should seek to promote these benefits further afield . #% The euro coming into operation provides an opportunity to simplify the bureaucratic procedures . #% The problem to date has been , in my experience in Northern Ireland , that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability , and this has been substantial . #% What does not have a place in energy and the environment is nuclear power because it is not sustainable . #% Such provisions are to be inserted in the directives on waste , the protection of waters against nitrate pollution as well as being included in the hazardous waste , copper packaging , air quality and landfill of waste directives . #% Commissioner Fischler has stated that the EU must work for sustainable fishing wherever EU fleets operate and we shall hold him to that goal . #% We also look to the European Council to consider ways of raising awareness amongst European citizens about the work of the European Union and the relevance of the EU to our daily lives . #% We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports . #% As the Commissioner himself said , only if public money is used is there any requirement to reduce capacity . #% I also had the honour of meeting many of the human rights activists in Colombia last year . #% That is the way forward for the future . #% 
Further to this progress , the Commission should be mandated to negotiate accession to the protocols supplementing the ECHR which concern rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Mr President , I am very disappointed at the outcome of the original Ó Neachtain/Stevenson report because of the adoption of Amendment No 20 . #% I am sorry that because of the late hour there are not more people here to listen to the appalling statistics of deaths of young children , of mothers -- needless deaths from illnesses that we could cure so easily . #% Yesterday in the House of Commons John Hume our colleague tabled a motion supported by many Members from different parties asking for a new international tribunal to investigate that event . #% In this regard , I want to recognise the work of Mr Harbour in particular , who has put an enormous amount of effort into bringing the compromise wording this far on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . #% The President-in-Office made a few remarks about human rights , which I think are a very important part of our agenda . #% Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January . #% Risk communication will also be a key element . #% The rural community has been under increasing pressure to survive . #% Four European treaties in less than 15 years have resulted in many undoubted European successes : the single market , the euro , the accession of eastern European countries , rising environmental standards , greater equality between women and men , and anti-poverty and full employment strategies , to name but a few . #% Madam President , recent events have demonstrated to the world that the military strategy being pursued by the American government in Afghanistan is working . #% In all countries we have a major problem with more and more oppressive legislation being introduced . #% The EU is China 's largest trading partner , after all , and it is our second-largest trading partner . #% Ireland 's path to recovery is being export-led ; thus the removal of barriers entering in the EU market is crucial . #% That is better late than never . #% It is important that Mr Mather focused in his Economic Committee report on the role of enterprise in particular . #% When this original directive was voted on by the European Parliament , a specific clause was inserted , known as Amendment No 95 , which recognized the right of small farmers to freely re-use all patented seed and to save and further develop their own seed . #% The conditions agreed within the international dolphin conservation programme for the use of purse seines which commonly will apply provisionally within the Community incorporate into this regulation a revision of mesh size for two species of spotted dogfish . #% The TSE proposal being put forward includes , among other things , a requirement for educational programmes for farmers , vets and officials ; the removal of a list of specified risk material , an active surveillance programme using rapid post-mortem tests ; and the strengthening of the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals . #% Speaking personally , I would like to see a full , thorough and impartial investigation into the state of those who have disappeared in Turkey , but the question was in relation to the Moscow mechanism and , for the reasons given , I think the views and replies given should stand . #% Mr President , I too would like to wish Mrs Damião a full and speedy recovery and thank her for her work on this report . #% Rather than repeat some of the comments made about these reforms , I just want to say that I have some concern about the severity of the price cut . #% This is hard to credit . #% In some respects , the exceptionalism in this document appears to me to reflect that kind of logic . #% This regulation replaced 894/97 with the exception of Articles 11 , 19 and 20 which related to driftnets and which were dealt with separately . #% The behaviour of the United States , not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq , is becoming increasingly difficult to understand . #% Despite the meagre resources at its disposal it does an exceptionally excellent job . #% We need to distinguish between two issues here . #% Mr President , yesterday I tried to raise the issue of Roisín McAliskey and her continued detention in a secure psychiatric unit in England . #% I very much regret that he is the victim of circumstances at this particular time . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , this report presents many positive things about the EU , for instance what it is doing to promote human rights and democracy . #% You are correct in saying that food labelling is not enough to protect consumers . #% We must adopt an immediate and categorical ban on the use of antibiotic resistant genes . #% This is something that should be highlighted , particularly at election time . #% The statement last night was that this was a victory of good over evil and that Saddam Hussein was good and the rest of the world was evil . #% Everyone recognises the need to control and monitor animal diseases , not only because of the human health implications , but also because of the economic consequences where there are outbreaks . #% The EU has accepted these ideas for some stocks and I think it is high time that it implemented them for its own stocks . #% We are prepared to judge each on his or her individual merit in the belief that not all were personally responsible for the ineptitude or incompetence of some . #% While there is unanimous approval for REACH 's aims , there is far less agreement over the means of achieving them , especially regarding the obligations it imposes on the chemical and pharmaceutical industries . #% We need to improve the service of information to women , both younger and older , about the risks of and availability of treatment for breast cancer in order to ultimately reduce the mortality rate of women and to improve their quality of life and assist them in returning to work if they so desire . #% I hope that all Members of the European Parliament will complain about this outrageous breach of human rights . #% As lime and dolime can only be produced by removing existing CO2 from limestone and dolomite , there is no way of reducing the CO2 emissions . #% I appreciate his very open and honest attitude to this . #% It was not the case and hence I did not object . #% Thirdly , the question regarding institutional balance is fair and maintains the equity and equality between the Member States . #% All of us believe that we must set clear limits to patentability . #% I give these examples to highlight the fact that just because a directive has been agreed it does not mean it has been implemented . #% However , this is the positive side of things , and we seem to be regressing in other areas . #% The presidency 's proposals for the use of qualified majority voting , and acting on the proposal for an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs , represent a step in the right direction . #% The White Paper raised expectations , and we look forward to the exciting campaign for take-off with its 1 million PV systems , its large windfarm , its biomass and most exciting of all its 100 communities where all the electricity will come from renewable energy . #% However , it is imperative , as also with Hong Kong , to continue monitoring to ensure that there is no erosion of democracy , human rights and freedoms . #% When we create wealth we can distribute it , but we must create it first and we must encourage those people who can create it . #% We have to ask ourselves what the European Union wants to achieve in reforming of the common fisheries policy . #% Maybe we should now examine how we can bring more people into the social dialogue . #% I wish to pay tribute to the Italian presidency . #% Ryanair has developed Charleroi airport from being a deserted field to catering for over two million passengers a year . #% Those who are concerned about human rights , animal welfare and the environment have a much better prospect of securing improvements in those areas within a legal framework and a World Trade Organisation than they have in a free-for-all , law of the jungle . #% That is not so and we should never allow anybody to say so . #% I accept what you have said , but I would ask you to analyse more deeply the views of those who know . #% At present , Ireland and Malta are the only two countries in EU without a national transplant authority to maximise organ usage . #% The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake . #% I should like to quote what you said about the technical assistance office for Leonardo : ` whether or not we continue cooperating with the technical assistance office in question will depend on a clear improvement in its management ' . #% The manufacturers will have to provide a guarantee prior to placing their products on the market to ensure the financing of subsequent disposal of the products - through insurance perhaps or a blocked bank account . #% The two protagonists and their international supporters can argue interminably , and sometimes even convincingly , to justify their sides ' violence . #% Payment can take many forms in terms of expenses or just compensating for lost hours at work , as distinct from profit in terms of payment . #% . The Parliament has voted to eliminate unsubstantiated claims on foods and drinks , especially products marketed to children . #% 
This performance gives the lie to the simplistic and essentially anti-European myth that preparing for EMU necessarily entails higher unemployment and drastic cuts in public expenditure . #% In relation to the UN review on the programme of action coming up in July 2003 , we also need to look at things that remain to be done . #% It is work which is carried out in difficult conditions , in an area where slackness and inefficiency in the implementation of budgets was traditional . #% To justify this by saying that we label them is completely ridiculous . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , my first comment is that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a real expression of solidarity between EU citizens and States . #% We represent their best hope . #% Taoiseach , you are not here to answer for your domestic policies . #% I make no comment on the issue that was being raised , but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impeded by the same demonstrators . #% Prison terms of up to three years can be imposed . #% It declares its supremacy over national constitutions ; it proclaims the subservience of national law ; it appoints its own president and foreign minister . #% However , we must question further tightening beyond the common position and whether it will bring any significant additional environmental benefits . #% I appeal to you , Madam President , to use your good offices to impress upon the Commission the concern of this House about the impact of the atrocities of 11 September in Europe where thousands , if not millions , of jobs are at risk . #% We must look at other possibilities , including partition and transmutation . #% Yet when you look at what happens in society - not just to young people but also to older people - one of the major problems we have is the abuse of alcohol , which contributes to violence in the home , violence on the streets and to serious crime . #% Finally , I would like to thank the Chairman for accepting our point on the protocol for the movement of non-susceptible animals and , in particular , the promise of a review of the movement of equines during future outbreaks , as horses are not susceptible in this case . #% Again , I compliment and congratulate my colleague , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , on his very extensive and constructive approach to this important report . #% The Commission , whilst pushing for the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps , states that the protocols have been ratified , but not everyone has ratified the transport protocol . #% Some people speak of two different policies , but it is important to remember that it is a single policy with two different pillars . #% We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which , with falling incomes , is now under serious threat . #% Appropriate accommodating monetary policy is not lax monetary policy . ' #% The issue of pensions , future contributions and necessity of securing pensions , is partly financial , no matter what anybody says . #% I would like to tell the House that on learning of his appointment he told me and some parliamentary colleagues that he had a premonition about going there , but he brushed that aside and set about fulfilling his mission there . #% In our individual Member States , and collectively as the European Union , we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table , under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict . #% The ordinary citizen wants to know what this treaty is all about . #% in writing . - I support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register . #% There is serious questioning in the scientific community about the possibility of speeding up vaccine production because of contamination risks . #% Building capacity both in the public and private sectors , enhancing production and conforming with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries , in particular external investment and expanding economies . #% As regards animals not being traced , I would like the Commission to see if it could look at some sort of strict regulation on greyhound breeding and the export of greyhounds . #% If we became a perfect pupil now in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , we would still suffer from past pollution , but the longer we wait to tackle greenhouse gas emissions in a serious manner , the more entrenched the commitment is . #% The Prestige incident should have been viewed as occurring in EU waters , with potentially devastating consequences for the shared environment and European fishing industries . #% The difficulties that have arisen - in this instance in relation to Chad - reflect very clearly why . #% We need to engage with citizens , producers and consumers regarding reduction , reuse and recycling of waste . #% We have called for the Commission to take action in this regard . #% Firstly , with regard to the issue of Russia and the whole energy area , we have made significant steps with regard to creating a partnership of equals . #% In good faith , I would request Commissioner Kyprianou , who is in the House today representing the Commission , to respond on behalf of the Commission to the serious concerns that have been generated by the text of Tuesday night 's declaration . #% I believe that if they are going to be full members of this Union within a number of years then they have a right to participate in debating what kind of Europe we are going to have . #% We are all aware in this House that a constitutional referendum on the Treaty of Nice is being held in Ireland next week . #% . Because of the rejection of all amendments which would have prevented European illegal fishing in the waters of Western Sahara I have voted against this resolution . #% There is an old maxim in the British system legal system called `` justice delayed is justice denied '' , and this case has been dragged out again and again . #% A heavy price is being paid and I would wish to acknowledge the sacrifice of the American , British and other troops seeking to bring order to this strife-torn land . #% Our policies in Africa lack coherence . #% I want to draw attention particularly to the BSE crisis , which has incurred an increase in expenditure of 50 % , up to ECU 7 billion in that sector . #% Therefore , the case for granting Objective 1 status to the midland region for the period 2000 to 2006 is both real and compelling and beyond reproach . #% The extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) to the aviation sector may be the best way forward to limiting these emissions and to ensuring that aviation , like all other sectors , contributes to reducing harmful greenhouse gases . #% With cancer rates across the world growing at this phenomenal rate , citizens are depending on governments for help , protection and information . #% The report of Amnesty International clearly raises many human rights issues which remain of serious concern to the Council . #% We must ask why . #% I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated . #% We are delighted that the amendment to limit the European Union ' s financial participation to 50 % was rejected by a large majority . #% We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of adversity . #% I support the recommendation that the voluntary code becomes a legally binding one . #% My second general point concerns the voting rules . #% Striking a blow against transit fraud would also represent a positive step against organized crime , which is one of the greatest problems facing the European Union . #% Finally , I want to say that in spite of all the talk about the necessity to cut back , this budget represents 1.22 % of GDP of the European Union . #% Is the Minister aware of China 's activities in the developing world ? #% A strong and unanimous approach by the Development Committee , supported by three other committees , has seen some sense prevail . #% It has little that is credible to contribute , for , when it mattered , the EU as an organisation and most EU Member States left the heavy lifting to others . #% Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion . #% For us sugar is sweet , yet in Brazil the landless speak of sugar with the taste of blood . #% The PPE-DE Group fully supports the emissions trading scheme and our objectives under Kyoto and agrees with the need to keep downward pressure on every one of the 25 Member States to meet their targets in relation to greenhouse gases , as agreed under Kyoto . #% The average aid pledges to Bosnia , Kosovo , East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $ 250 per person , as against $ 75 for Afghanistan . #% Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country . #% I have seen much excellent research funded by European grants , both in collaborative projects with industry and across borders , and in individual grants to expert scientists . #% I salute the quiet but effective diplomacy of Mr Solana and his colleagues , the Belgian Presidency , the Commission and others , because , while America has been looking in another direction , we have managed to de-escalate the worst of the tensions , a necessary prelude to the Mitchell process which is the path to a viable peace . #% Many investors were bankrupted , some committed suicide and we need to know why , who was at fault and why there was a delay in the implementation of European Union law . #% There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously . #% 
Mr Bowis led us in relation to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , and he leads us here in this report . #% We propose to double the spending on science and society . #% There is therefore a general urgency and , in some parts , even a specific one . #% Beef farmers are still suffering from the aftermath of the BSE crisis in the UK , which has thrown the whole beef industry into a spiralling free fall , with consumption badly damaged . #% Legislation governing the health and safety of workers throughout the EU is a prime example of how the EU has made and can make a positive contribution to raising the quality of life for millions of the Union 's citizens . #% If the Court of Justice or any other court in the European Union is using it to bind Member States , individuals or associations to an interpretation of that charter , then they are incorrect in law , in justice and in legal interpretation . #% I want some information about that and specifically about the Industry Council . #% This will be expensive , but it is well worth paying that price . #% I look forward to a paper from the Commission with concrete proposals to give effect to many of the very useful ideas put forward in the proposed charter . #% Mr President , I agree with and support most of what has been said , but I wish to raise two points . #% In fact it calls for pre-arranged reviews of nuclear safety authorities , rather than a proper inspection of nuclear facilities , and that is clearly nonsense . #% Continued inaction will eventually cost us up to one fifth of our annual gross domestic product , but real action will mean a 1 % spend . #% It is my first report in Parliament and I was glad to take on such a significant one . #% Mr President , firstly my congratulations to Mr Goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation . #% Last week 's events , however , saw an unfortunate and heated debate on the financial situation of the European Union . #% In relation to business directories - where companies , individuals , schools , have been trapped into paying money to companies that publish names and then require payment , where people initially did not believe payment was necessary , or indeed required , or worse still , where people did not want the service at all - we are still inundated by individuals who are trapped and feel powerless to resist the pressures of these unscrupulous business directory companies . #% It would , of course , make it easier for other firms to enter , but it would also make it easier for Irish companies to do business abroad . #% The battle against terrorism is above all a battle of values and a battle of ideas . #% We do not want to jeopardise what has been a successful job creation mechanism by sending out strong signals to investors that we do not want to remain at the heart of the European Union and at the heart of the internal market . #% The American founding father Benjamin Franklin once said that ` He who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither ' , and I believe that Europe would do well to heed this particular piece of advice over the coming months . #% Mr President , in the run-up to the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Naples , pessimism about the likely outcome was evident . #% Indeed , I believe the allocation of rural funding should bear some proportionality to the budgetary contributions of Member States . #% It is illogical given the huge variation in size of nuclear programmes . #% Because people do not necessarily agree with every word that others say , this does not mean that they have no right to say it . #% Even though I have many concerns with regard the approval of many of the amendments , and also on the many inconsistencies which these have raised , I voted in favour of the report , firstly to allow the first reading process to completed and secondly , because I believe that when we return to this issue at second reading the text will have been improved . #% Some scientists have taken the lunacy of Hitler 's fascism from the battlefield and are prepared to validate it in the laboratory . #% They are particularly concerned that the traditional , consensual , decision-making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries . #% I hope , therefore , that this will be taken seriously and Mrs Lenz 's report will be supported by all groups . #% There is at times an attitude in some European quarters to the effect that ` we know best ; we will bring about the appropriate changes and the people will thank us for them later ' . #% If we want these new structures to be a success , wide publicity is going to have to be put in place . #% So even if the Council was able , in its wisdom , to accept a programme to limit fishing effort , that would not end the story , for there would be ever-increasing demands from the industry to allow more fishing . #% As you can see , Chancellor , despite the fact that you took on board some of the ideas Parliament spoke about ; despite the fact that you included parliamentarians with regard to decision-making ; you still get criticised for not being here enough or for not doing enough within Parliament . #% I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% It is not appropriate for a polity like the EU , with its proper and legitimate aspiration to be a world force , to be benignly neutral in the UN mode . #% She was killed because of her exposés of the drugs underworld and all of us in Ireland were very shocked by this callous act . #% I suggest to the presidency that , with regard to the many genuine difficulties that exist at the present time between Arab countries and the western countries , there is perhaps a need for a study on how best relations between the European Union and these countries might be improved . #% The two most important issues that come before the Petitions Committee are the recognition of people 's qualifications to work in other Member States and the environmental impact of construction development . #% It completely flies in the face of conservation and sustainable fishing and there is no justification for it . #% That is why , as a human rights spokesperson , I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report . #% Size control should also be a ` must ' when we consider the design of an effective control policy . #% As usual , she has produced an excellent report ; we expect nothing else from her . #% Hazardous substances that are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic should not be used in cosmetics at all under the current proposal unless they are evaluated by a scientific committee and found acceptable . #% Nevertheless , we look forward to a proposal from the Commission on the subject , which is of great importance . #% Only recently at the opening of an exhibition in Brussels by the ambassador of one of the Arab countries , he availed himself of the opportunity to tell me how difficult things were for him and his colleagues . #% Undoubtedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer . #% Patents on human bodies , on human cloning , on embryos and on altering the human germ line are all banned in the draft from the Legal Affairs Committee . #% I ask you to use your discretion in interpreting that aspect and to give us clear guidance on what latitude you will allow us . #% It need not necessarily impose a major burden on the European Union budget . #% The great car culture has been referred to before in European Parliament reports as the main culprit of air pollution in Europe and Parliament is now playing an active role in establishing limit values for various pollutants so as to bring this environmental problem under control . #% Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen ? #% We need to try to restore not only the pleasure of flying but also the sense of safety that people have when they board an aircraft and go from place to place . #% For the reasons already stated , and in particular because of Ireland 's dependency on its agri-food sector , I appeal to colleagues to support the existing derogation for Ireland and the United Kingdom to allow the description ` milk chocolate ' within the marketing territory of both countries . #% Has the Commission agreed that this is not a conflict of interest ? #% An in-depth inquiry is needed to answer all these questions ; after all we are dealing with investors who , if catastrophe strikes , have to pay and pay to the point where they can lose their businesses and their homes . #% Local communities , from the private , public and voluntary sectors must be allowed to pool their collective talents in an effort to create employment within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in their respective areas . #% If we do not agree , having adopted common policies , to give ourselves the resources to ensure that these policies are put into effect , then we are really stretching ourselves too far and we are only bringing the Community and its laws and regulations into disrepute . #% One of the main points to be considered is to ensure that pilot fatigue does not endanger flight safety . #% There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report . #% I believe that it sends out the wrong signal , at a time when public confidence in Europe is suffering , and that the common agricultural policy is damaged by any mention of cofinancing . #% Those of us entrusted with the task of ensuring a future for our past must now act with decisiveness . #% Artistic trades are part of our heritage and this knowledge needs to be passed on . #% I should like to compliment her on her interest in pursuing the whole matter . #% Mr President , the two reports which have been discussed here this morning should set alarm bells ringing for most European citizens . #% It is genetic , its infectious , its degenerative , but there are very , very few cases , given , for example , the number of BSE cases in the UK in the cattle herd . #% This is something that will not unravel anything , nor will it upset balances in the final outcome . #% I think if people reflect on that they will find it deals with the matter raised by the honourable Member . #% 
I spoke yesterday about the need for respect and dignity and about all of us agreeing on the principles of what is contained in this draft Statute . #% I would appeal to the Members to bear this in mind when they are voting tomorrow in relation to this question of increasing the budget . #% That should not be allowed to continue and authorities who fail to enforce the law should themselves be held liable for the environmental damage caused as a result . #% I look forward to further analysis of the sector when we look at the MiFID Directive later on this year . #% We need industry to buy into what we are saying . #% Our citizens will want to know why we want to spend more on space research than on sustainable transport . #% I support Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya 's proposal for a narrower definition of the term ` reduced mobility ' . #% The pragmatists are those who know what can be attained and have to endure the frustration when this is less than they would like . #% You already have some idea what the external audit is going to say with regard to the future operation of the programme . #% The Irish human rights body , a government-sponsored body , has called on the Irish Government to establish a legally enforceable regime of aircraft inspections , which at the moment does not exist . #% These oil deposits produce more than three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil and their exploitation is also extremely damaging to the local environment and a threat to the First Nations communities who live in the region . #% I would like the Commissioner here tonight to confirm that this cooperation is working to the maximum and as well as he would wish . #% She was one of the nine ` disappeared ' who the IRA in Ireland claims responsibility for . #% If we are not to have a conflict between science and society , which the Commissioner has been very anxious to avoid , we will need to revise these priorities . #% We are all in this together . #% This is a new technology and one that offers huge potential in the medical field for the treatment of many diseases for which as yet there are no cures , and for the relief of suffering and pain for millions of people . #% They are looking for joint ventures . #% We have had the MacSharry reform , another tranche of it now . #% Unchecked shipments usually end up in Ghana , Nigeria , India or Pakistan . #% The debate on the IGC and treaty reform should be characterised by caution and by mature reflection . #% The European Union is implementing the European Climate Change Programme , which will ensure that the Union achieves the 8 % cut in emissions between 2008 and 2012 , which is our political commitment under the Kyoto Protocol . #% I am happy to report that one of those initiatives , the establishment of a forum in Ireland on the future of Europe , has been adopted by the Irish Government . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Buitenweg for this report and for her commonsensical approach to the issue she has had to deal with . #% The cooperation that is necessary from all Member States and the need to take advantage of the stimulus packages currently launched by almost all Member States and the Commission underscore the need for investment in renewable technology to increase our energy security and decrease our CO2 emissions . #% Mr President , the House will recall that I , along with other Members , have raised on a number of occasions , the incarceration of Roisín McAliskey , who is seven months pregnant , in a category A jail . #% The challenge for all of us is to put in place mechanisms , and crucially resources , to realise these goals . #% I have this problem in my own constituency . #% Mr President , first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants . #% They are citizens of the EU as well and it is up to the EU to do something about this and also about the illegal occupation of Iraq . #% It is essential that the financing of the new common agricultural policy after 2013 recognises this , and the very least we need is that the budget should be maintained at least at its current level . #% I would call on this House to ensure that we do not put in place any hindrances to the development of this industry , which is a vital sector for the economy and employment creation . #% The rejection of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish people is not a rejection of enlargement . #% During the Irish presidency the government should be seeking support from other Member States for an urgent reform of policing structures in Northern Ireland . #% That is a tragedy , considering that it happened in their own constituency . #% I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building . #% If the Member States do not have a lenient policy in their countries they should change it and not force the rest of us to drag our standards down to theirs . #% This does not mean rubber-stamping bad practice in Europe , but developing good practice for the future , good law , good patent examiners , and a quick death for applications that are clearly not inventions . #% When Commissioner Gradin raised this issue and made it one of the priorities for her term of office , there was probably quite a lot of amusement and scepticism about the extent of the problem . #% This is not a matter of political bargaining or any special arrangements , as that would be contrary to the Treaty . #% Israeli security will not be obtained by building an ` apartheid wall ' , which has less to do with security than with Ariel Sharon 's long-standing plan to annex Palestinian territory . #% I was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Group 's objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues ; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say . #% Because of the advent of liberalisation and greater competition , which I welcome , let me hasten to add , we have also learned of some of the mistakes that can be made by just having a headlong rush into liberalisation . #% We have seen too much abuse of this loose definition of `` self-employed '' in other areas of work . #% Some of the Euratom aspects are missing , as well as research , structural funds , MEDA and large aspects of PHARE and TACIS . #% I have some doubts about the capability of the European Commission to have the resources and rigour which our citizens demand . #% Everyone has to cooperate if we are to succeed . #% I welcome the consultation process and can assure colleagues that in my Member State the authorities took care to carry out a broad and meaningful consultation . #% Yet I have to say that in all my political life I have never seen so much anger as I saw in my constituency and across the border in Northern Ireland over the weekend . #% The adoption of this ILO convention can help reduce the numbers of working poor , improve working conditions and facilitate the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable workers . #% Mr President , I want to welcome the cross-party support for this debate , initiated by our group and spearheaded by Mrs Todini , on the complex and disturbing issue of violence against children . #% Perhaps it is a kind of progress that they agree on 19th century absolute sovereignty , although it is unfortunate that they continue to fall out over the outcome of the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 ! #% As a company , Equitable Life was in financial trouble for a long time . #% We need the highest possible level of confidentiality for business , while not compromising human health and the environment , by allowing registrants to use third-party representatives where possible and by protecting against the publication of sensitive business information on the Agency 's website . #% I refer specifically to the 2001 directive which deals with strategic environmental impact assessments and the 2000 directive which deals with the prudent use and protection of water resources -- all of which are the subject of this complaint . #% I think you will agree with me but if you do not you should say it here that Malta is well qualified economically and otherwise ahead of other applicant countries . #% I have made the point on the number of occasions in this House that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by farmers is uncertainty - not being able to plan , even in the short term , for the development of their farms . #% When the overall aspects of the different economies within the European Union and throughout the world are considered , those which have created the best and most numerous jobs are those which focus on five key issues . #% In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands . #% Mr President , in making our decisions on the aviation industry in Europe we have to take account of the interconnectedness of our economies and politics in Europe and globally as well . #% However , I would hate it if people - especially the people in the gallery watching us today - went away from this Chamber thinking that this is merely an opportunity for the European Union to bash America . #% But are we crazy ? #% Yet again this House calls on the Council to respond to its clearly expressed wish : real , effective actions against the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe now . #% Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing . #% He gave a lot up to the very last minute and I believe what America has done here is an example for Europe as well of what a major power , through its influence and good diplomacy , can achieve throughout the world . #% If you push the rule of law aside and ignore it you are in effect allowing the terrorists to win on another front . #% It is essential that , not only in presenting a new opportunity to Kosovo , we also take into consideration the unique and special concerns that Serbia has . #% 
We could then prepare a statement that could be read and understood by Members of this Parliament , by members of national parliaments and students of European politics . #% A recent survey in Ireland showed that , while Irish freshwaters are still markedly less polluted than the European average , up to 30 % of river length has been contaminated by phosphates . #% But if you look at what the Commission is actually doing now , it seems that it is changing its approach to this . #% If you have taken legal action against a Member State , surely the only thing you should be concerned about is any kind of information that would prejudice your case against the Member State ? #% The great thing about this Commission and the European Union is that they have allowed people of different political ideologies to put aside their individual ideologies in order to arrive at a consensus for the common good . #% We are pleased to support all Mr Evans ' amendments and we wish him and all those who benefited from the Tempus programme a very happy Christmas . #% Any EU Member States , including mine , can make mistakes . #% Look at the human demographic situation , where we have an ageing population , a dropping birthrate in most Member States , and where we do not have strategies to respond to that . #% It is exactly such local realities that the Commission needs to reflect more and more on the implementation of what is too often rigid dogma on State aid and indeed on other policies affecting the European Union . #% Madam President , today offers an important corrective opportunity and an important step forward in this debate . #% Mr President , I support the action plan of the European Commission , which seeks to promote the greater use of alternative fuels in Europe between now and 2010 . #% I hope there will be plenty of men around when I need care at the end of my life . #% The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law with a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced . #% We call on the Upper Sharia Court of Appeal of Katsina to respect and uphold the international human rights agreements that Nigeria has signed up to and to ensure that any Sharia law in breach of these rights is repealed . #% In fact we have a moral obligation to do more than to warn young people , in particular teenagers , of the acute dangers of cigarette smoking for our health . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Girão Pereira for his report and to say that I support this deal made on behalf of European fishermen . #% The enlargement negotiations with the applicant countries will be entering a new phase during the Spanish Presidency . #% As Commissioner Patten said , it is up to the Council to raise this matter with the United States , and the EU Council has failed abysmally to do so on any occasion . #% The implementation of the Social Policy Action Programme 2000-2005 as published by the Commission will also help in combating social exclusion . #% In relation to the second part of the honourable Member 's question , I will bring her comments to the attention of the President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers . #% The US Government has been a very strong supporter of its industry , especially since 11 September , and continues to be so . #% We have no redress ... #% Secondly , it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries , including flags of convenience , and there are still no controls in place to prevent this . #% In this House we have a duty to deal with the facts , not to listen to the jungle drums beating from misinformed sources . #% This protocol is designed to transfer capacity from the European Union to Latvia by making it easier to establish joint enterprises . #% There are occasions when `` a one size fits all '' economic model does not fit . #% Secondly , there are obviously going to be carry-over issues from one year to the next on which agreement has yet to be reached . #% In the United States - and I speak so much about it because I visited it recently to study carefully what is happening in that country - they have trading permits for sulphur dioxide . #% I wish to say on behalf of my group that when the IGC comes we will continue to press for Treaty reform on the question of individual accountability . #% Finally , Parliament has capitulated to the Commission and the Council in its refusal to uphold its already inadequate first reading position . #% This seems an extraordinary amount of fish . #% I know that many of them are keen that we complete our business here tomorrow and enable the Council to arrive at an early decision . #% Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions . #% That to me is very regressive and needs to change . #% At a time when we are going towards rail , here are people in my region trying to close down railways ! #% I also hope that it will force the UK Treasury and Miss Knight , as Economic Secretary , to pay their bills on time . #% Records in this House will show that on a previous occasion I called on the Commission to exercise its powers under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to verification of nuclear installations at Sellafield . #% He can not talk to journalists and he is also barred from going within 100 metres of foreign embassies . #% They need patent protection that is affordable and enforceable against industry giants . #% We have to show the people that we are serious about this and we have to ensure that what happened in areas like Iran and Afghanistan does not reoccur in terms of how we ... #% The EU had its chance to give such equality of funding to Northern Ireland for necessary infrastructure but it failed , by making national statistics instead of regional need the threshold for access . #% I believe that we must direct more funding to these communities under the European Fisheries Fund post-2013 . #% National transport issues are a matter for national governments and , accordingly , each Member State should be free to determine its own rules and criteria on drivers ' licences . #% Is this also a situation which is governed by market forces or is there , in fact , a problem with its legality ? #% In conclusion , the real message that must emerge from Göteborg before all others - the first among equals of messages - should be clearly addressed to the candidate countries , and say : we are ready to do business . #% It is not difficult to transpose that kind of ideology into a direct consumer-service-provider relationship also . #% The Commission 's proposal allows for a series of exceptions from organic production rules , such as the case of setting up organic farms or solving livestock management problems . #% What I want to know is whether or not that request has been acceded to before I proceed with what I might like to say . #% It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system . #% The pilots for these jets are due to be trained in Wales . #% I have been told by some of them that they see working in an EU country as a great opportunity , but I wonder if we ever give a thought to those left behind , especially to the sick . #% If they did not exist there would be many more millions of people on the breadline . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , may I join with the Commissioner in expressing my sympathy to the people of Nigeria on the death of President Umaru Yar ` Adua . #% For the first time ever an EU state was criticised unanimously , indeed reprimanded , by Ecofin . #% My Group in particular welcomes the changes that you have outlined in your statement . #% There is fraud at every level of government at which I have served - local , national and European and regional . #% It is now vital that the EU establish a framework for customs services effectively functioning as if they were one . #% My question is related to Mr Smith 's question . #% I have one reservation , however . #% We in this Parliament are the tribune of the peoples of the European Union and we have gathered here today to declare solemnly our outrage , our sympathy , our solidarity and our common bond in humanity and democracy with the people of the United States of America , and with the people of New York City and Washington D.C. . #% If we are to provide these medicines to those who need them , we have to override the intellectual property rights of companies who have patented the technology to combat these diseases . #% In relation to China , we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked . #% The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one . #% It is important that we explain to business what its obligations are and what it has to do to achieve your consumer protection objectives . #% Like the great majority of the people on the island of Ireland , I have always aspired to a united Ireland . #% Many Member States have a major problem with the military component and it is very cynical to say that we want to help the social area when clearly this plan is a military plan . #% 
in writing . - Dear colleagues , it is with delight today that I address this parliament as we have moved towards a more equal role in the relationship between richer and poorer countries while strengthening human rights . #% They , despite their pain , have opted to try and prevent others facing the same trauma in the future . #% The inquiry or investigation must be credible if we are to learn lessons from what happened . #% I should also like to thank Mr Busquin , an excellent Commissioner , who has been very skilful along with his staff in ensuring that we could get a result early in the process . #% I look forward to seeing these reflected in the final regulation . #% But there is a message for Northern Ireland as well : accelerate the uptake and help those of us fighting for your cause in this House to be justified by next December in asking the Minister - I know that his and his government 's good will is there - to back a realistic and fair package for Northern Ireland , which we will vote on Thursday . #% The current ` integrated approach ' to financing environmental policy being proposed by the Commission , whereby funding will come from rural development funding and structural funds , worries me deeply and I think it simply will not work . #% This is now a very good report . #% Let me say very clearly that the disconnect between agriculture and food is part of the problem that we are debating here today . #% Indeed , Mr President , as that is happening I have no doubt that the continued support from the European Union and from the European Commission and Council of Ministers in particular , through economic regeneration , will play a major role in strengthening the common ground enormously and in expressing to our people at grass-roots level the massive international goodwill that exists for peace in the offshore island of the European Union . #% Despite supporting many measures mentioned in the reports , such as increased role for the Parliament in the drawing up of the Code of Conduct for Commissioners and the enhanced role of the Parliament in international negotiations , I strongly disagree with the rapporteur 's assumption that ` the Treaty of Lisbon significantly deepens democracy in the EU , giving citizens of the Union , mainly through Parliament , a reinforced power of scrutiny of the Commission ' . #% The common organisation of the market in sugar has already undergone several reforms , including an agreement to reduce quotas by 500 000 tonnes for the 2000-2001 marketing year . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I would also like to thank the Commissioner . #% We were there to evaluate progress on human rights issues and the effects of reforms on the ground . #% , in writing . - The current high oil prices have had a severe impact on operating costs of fishermen , even forcing some to stop work . #% However , I deplore the cynical manner in which the Irish Government has chosen to divide the country into regions for party-political purposes , with scant regard for the aim of structural funds which was to assist with economic and social cohesion . #% That is why it is so important that we all guarantee that we reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe , the United States of America and elsewhere so as to achieve our objective in this regard . #% in writing . - The concept of the European Innovation Partnership is a vital part of the commitments under the flagship initiative . #% Of course we must have cooperation . #% Would you not also agree that , while there is obviously some equipment which may or may not be used for torture , stun gun equipment is made to deliberately inflict pain on the person against whom it is used ; that up to 50 000 volts can be delivered to a person by a stun gun or by the stun belts which are also used ; and that it is inappropriate for equipment of this kind which is marketed by the manufacturers of these torture weapons to carry an EU quality mark as a sign of EU approval of these particular instruments of torture ? #% I commend the rapporteur and his report . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate my respected colleague General Morillon on his report . #% They are allowed in there at the moment . #% Well , we all know what we need to do with a time bomb : we need to defuse it . #% Likewise , our Group will have a free vote on paragraph 7 , indent 1 , on African lions . #% In this respect I believe the Commission has , on the whole , made a very balanced proposal . #% Let us not forget that some countries have only transposed the framework decision in the last number of months . #% One of the key components which must be enshrined within all liberalisation or competition law in this area is the question of universal access for all , so that no matter where anybody is living they have the same access as somebody living in a large urbanised area . #% I do not want to see European Union funds being spent on a practice that is illegal in some countries , including my own country , Ireland , and also in Germany , Austria , Italy and Portugal . #% If licence applications from these Member States do not cover all the fishing opportunities fixed by the protocol , the Commission may take into consideration licence applications from other Member States . #% By doing so the legitimacy of the European integration project has been enhanced and the potential for creating a more democratic and inclusive Europe has also been created . #% The Irish people believe in the European Union and in enlargement , and will deal with these issues in its own time and in its own way . #% The threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will . #% In fact , despite repeated appeals to Commissioner Fischer Boel to allow the ruling to be reconsidered and allow ethanol to be produced in these factories using the sugar beet immediately available , I have been assured that the plants will be completely dismantled . #% These architects were seen by the competent authorities in their Member States as having sufficient acquired experience and ability to be allowed to practice as de facto architects . #% Add to this the fact that our Kyoto CO2 emissions are now at 1990 levels plus 22 % already 10 % over target for 2010 , and the fact that there will be little or no decrease in car prices even if there is a removal or reduction in VRT because car manufacturers have had to reduce their prices to offset our high tax regime - and they will revert their prices if the tax burden is lightened - and you have altogether a very complicated field of play . #% A petition by over 3 , 000 people with disabilities throughout the Community resulted in my report which I am proud to say was passed unanimously last December . #% There is a commitment here -- and also on the part of the Commission -- to ensure that any legislation or moves in that area will be by codecision . #% They can not understand why we impose on ourselves international impotence in the face of the conflicts that surround us in the world at large . #% Would the Commissioner not agree that it is scandalous that no fines were imposed on the Italian authorities by the European Court of Justice , given that it is now almost 20 years since the matter was first brought to the Commission 's attention , and that on each occasion when the Court has decided on this matter , it has found against Italy ; and that even today , as I understand it , in La Sapienza University the criteria laid down have still not been complied with ? #% Yes , there are issues relating to competition for self-employed , but this legislation will not deal with those matters . #% In conclusion , we must open our arms and welcome the rejuvenation that the arrival of the countries from central and eastern Europe will bring about . #% As the new Integrated Programme is open to some third countries ( Iceland , Liechtenstein , Norway , Bulgaria , Romania , Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Serbia and Montenegro , Switzerland ) , it has a huge potential for contributing to intercultural understanding . #% I think that is a slightly different question from the one you have been answering . #% It is flawed because we have moved away from the social dialogue and social partnership model where there was agreement between both sides of industry before a proposal came before this Parliament . #% However , the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs , Mrs Bonino , together with national governments must put in place comprehensive information campaigns relating specifically to the pricing of products in the euro and the national currency of the host Member State in the run up to EMU . #% On the key issue of funding of the agricultural fund for European development , I have some misgivings , because unless there is unanimous agreement in Council on the financial prospectus for the period 2007 to 2013 , this whole project could find itself in limbo land . #% I refer in this case to the transnational abduction of children by their parents and also the increasing problem of transnational abduction of children by criminal means . #% Indeed , I agree with the suggestion in the report that other pollutant emissions should be part of the equation , although it might be difficult to include this measure initially . #% Mr President , I agree with the persons who have said that this procedure is now a bit meaningless . #% That is one of the things about the proposals for reform . #% Events have taken place over the last 10 days which have led to serious instability in Northern Ireland and have placed in peril the substantial achievements of the peace process over the last two years . #% It behoves us to take this matter seriously . #% In my own country , Ireland , for example , EUR 160 m are to be spent on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector . #% The beef regime is the most complicated of all the regimes , mainly because it has the longest lead time . #% However , could the 54 % increase announced today by the Ombudsman be connected to the fact that a lot of Members of the European Parliament were in election mode and generating publicity ? #% Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint . #% Let us be realistic , there will always be something more immediately important than protecting the environment . #% I would like the Commission to give us more details as to what is going to be funded by the development fund and how it is going to be managed . #% Dr Tannock drew to our attention the question of concern about the supply of blood and plasma products for haemophiliacs if the source of supply is outside the Union . #% This system would also provide efficiency in obtaining and enforcing judgments within the EU . #% The Union gives three-fifths of all aid to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States . #% Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception , and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at . #% The Commission must make full use of its powers under the EU Treaties , especially Article 169 , to open up the market . #% Antibiotics should not be added to foods . #% We have to ask ourselves : if Russia and China can support the government , why can not we support the suffering Sudanese people ? #% 
I am happy to be one of the sponsors of Sara Méndez and her lost child . #% We have misgivings about your approach . #% We are not prescriptive in the manner of achieving this . #% Energy efficiency has quite rightly been called the fifth fuel . #% This should also be reflected in EU competition policy . #% I am leaning in favour of it , but the scientific and practical doubts remain . #% It is a piecemeal approach in which the emphasis varies according to the publication . #% Citizens throughout Europe have a right to have these products circulating freely in the Member States under single market rules as much as any other product , provided that all considerations of safety and efficacy are properly applied . #% Member States , at the next revision of the Treaties , must adopt a clear legal base on the EU Treaties to promote the best interests of the child . #% I value the transatlantic relationship . #% We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture , not just in Ireland , but also in the EU as a whole . #% But the system , as Lord Inglewood has said , has to be attractive to industry and business otherwise it will simply be an irrelevance . #% Well , in discussing the budget , it is important to note the important role that the European Union and the European Parliament have played in this peace process through the International Fund for Ireland , the establishment of the Peace and Reconciliation Fund , INTERREG and the removal , through the Single Act , of the economic border which affected the border region for many years . #% We may recall that the European Consumers ' Association , which represents the consumers of the European Union , carried out an extensive survey of charges for cross-border payments only last year . #% Incidents occurring in one Member State are not necessarily known in another Member State and similar circumstances can lead to fatal accidents . #% Secondly , is it possible to remove the blockages which have been put in place because of dependence on Article 235 by Member States , particularly in programmes that relate directly to alleviating the poverty traps which disabled people have fallen into because of the lack of work at national level ? #% I would also like to thank the Commissioner for some of the hints she has given us on what she hopes to achieve in the coming year with regard to these guidelines and strategies . #% I would like to put on record a letter written yesterday by Professor Trakatellis , Chairman of the Conciliation Committee , and by me as rapporteur to President Barroso : #% These are very serious allegations and I should also point out that similar allegations have been made as regards Somalia . #% Due to the very technical nature of the European Parliament 's investigations into this issue , this Committee of Inquiry is going to take a lot more time to complete its work . #% It is very difficult for the local community . #% Not our Charlie ! #% Many speakers have alluded to this . #% Secondly , while the 10 % increase in complaints to the Ombudsman is not to be welcomed , we should recognise and interpret these figures within the context of the efforts that the office has made to increase its profile . #% From the outset I made it quite clear that I wanted this report to reflect the concerns of Parliament as a whole and not of any one group . #% Since 1954 , when our TB scheme was introduced , we have spent in Ireland - a small country - EUR 2.54 billion on TB testing and subsequently brucellosis testing . #% This would make things happen in Europe and give considerable added value to the European Union 's work on energy . #% The agreement reached in Berlin in 1999 on Agenda 2000 still stands and will be reviewed before the end of 2006 so as to examine the next financial perspective . #% The proposed environmental programme includes a review of all existing technical conservation measures within the next two years , to reduce ecosystem and environmental damage . #% Yet , Mr Blair , you are prepared to sacrifice Europe 's budget agreement and the European project to continue being the populist servant of Mr Murdoch and his newspapers . #% I particularly welcome the decision to create a Peace-Building Commission as well as the inclusion of the concept of human security in the official UN framework . #% I speak for the part of the Republic of Ireland which lies on the border . #% Today I voted in favour of the package of amendments designed to ensure the inclusion of key ethical safeguards in the legislation on advanced therapy medicinal products . #% Companies and institutions must be forced to adapt their services to suit the needs of the consumers and particularly those consumers to whom the Internet and the telecommunications revolution could open the most possibilities of all by bringing them into the real world and bringing them into dialogue . #% It takes away our individuality and our humanity . #% All transporters , lorries and storage bins must be fully flushed before reuse with unmedicated feed . #% No European money whatsoever has been involved in the project . #% It is often forgotten , that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution . #% I do not understand the problem . #% I am also calling for much closer cooperation between the police , the courts , the revenue authorities and financial institutions . #% We need to bring the people of Europe with us at each stage and we can not take their support for granted . #% No-fly zones should be established immediately around the two reprocessing plants in the EU : Sellafield and Cap de la Hague . #% I am very satisfied that the Finnish Government intends to pursue this matter vigorously over the next six months . #% We also believe that the EU must ensure coherence between its internal and external policies . #% It is totally unacceptable that Gilad Shalit has been denied his rights as a prisoner of war to which the Goldstone Report categorically states he is entitled . #% Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations . #% There have been numerous bilateral talks but so far a final political settlement has not been secured . #% The real danger for Europe is not the danger of a race to the bottom , but relates to the need for Europe to make sure that it is winning the race to stay ahead and that it does not sink to the bottom . #% Force can not defeat force , but peace can be built on peace . #% Let me highlight some of the amendments . #% I accused the Commissioner of being obstinate and arrogant at the public hearing which Parliament held . #% I believe that convicted drug barons should be given a minimum forty-year jail sentence in view of the fact that the European Union does not have the death penalty . #% This agency must be equipped with the resources to undertake this task . #% One of the issues still to be decided in these negotiations concerns the number of European Commissioners to be appointed in the future . #% On development issues he is one of the safest pairs of hands as far as I can see . #% The ECR Group therefore voted in favour of this report . #% It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of Ireland 's entire fishing industry and the survival of all Ireland 's coastal communities may depend on your support . #% Such shameful association not only diminishes those who so taint themselves but undermines what should be a united stand by all democratic parties against criminality , whether of the racist or any other variety . #% We want an explanation about Chernobyl . #% We need more accountability , we need more transparency , we need more devolution but we above all need more commitment . #% This declaration is one of the most significant signs that I have seen , as a Parliamentarian , that our demands can influence the direction of the European Council . #% Reducing the GWP threshold in mobile air conditioning will effectively mean that the development of CO2 technology is the only option for European car manufacturers at the present time . #% One area which must be emphasized above all is transport . #% One crucial one is how we connect our investment and research and development and innovation to the production system itself . #% Mr President , in the context of the concerns and wider debate on combating obesity and other chronic diseases , the Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation , based on nutrient profiling , will have absolutely no impact . #% It is time for the European institutions to be equally vociferous in bringing the arguments in favour of a single currency to Europe 's electorate . #% 
If we had received the same support from the Council of Ministers and the Commission we would have made progress . #% I continue to express my concerns that this EU directive should not undermine the competitiveness and innovation of our brightest and best companies in Europe , in particular by putting EU business and industry at a disadvantage in the global marketplace . #% People with problems , like people with pains , want relief and they want it as quickly and as inexpensively as possible . #% I fully support my colleague Mr Trakatellis 's approach . #% But let us reflect that in most parliaments a vote of no confidence in a single member of the government results in the entire government resigning , not just the individual minister . #% The G7 criteria for doing so is leastcost and safety conscious and it has now been proven by official studies that this is not the least-cost or the safest option . #% Air delays in Europe have reached the worse level in nine years . #% I welcome this proposal both because it provides greater information for consumers -- particularly those who suffer from allergies -- and because it lays down a high level of product safety through increased transparency and producer responsibility enforced by a system of national sanctions for non-compliance . #% But legislation is just one part of the equation ; enforcing that legislation is another . #% Mr President , this is a subject we could fruitfully discuss for a long time yet . #% Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us . #% In fact , we have the most rigorous animal welfare regulations enshrined in Irish law and we are fully enforcing them . #% The Convention on the Future of Europe has met in public , has debated in public , all the issues have been thrashed out in public . #% Finally , Mr President , I feel that I must mention the questions to the Commission and in particular Question 53 by Mr Alf Lomas on racism and fundamentalism in Brussels . #% Whatever the reasons for this delay , what is certain is that in its 1997 report the Commission cited it as a reason not to entertain the problems that Ireland had with the 1985 Directive , despite the fact that , as I said , the delay was caused solely by the Commission . #% As a Union we facilitate the free movement of persons . #% There have been a number of recent reports - a very important study in The Lancet last year for example - which show that babies born within three kilometres of toxic landfill sites - and potentially all landfill sites - are more likely to suffer birth defects than babies born elsewhere . #% While flooding has always been a fact of life in Ireland , its increasing frequency and severity is another real reminder of the effects of climate change caused by the reckless abuse of our environment . #% Commissioner , I should like to know , firstly , your own directorate 's response to this type of action and , secondly , whether there are any other mechanisms , besides going through the Czech authorities , that can be utilised in future to prevent this particular instance and also similar instances which are currently threatened in Poland , Hungary and Slovenia . #% I believe that this is the case here . #% National emissions allowance capping will ensure that quantifiable Kyoto objectives are met and that we decouple economic growth from increased greenhouse gas emissions . #% I want to say straight away that I do not support the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent European public prosecutor . #% Madam President , it is a matter of deepest concern and regret for us all that the prospects for a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has receded in recent months . #% I do not want to go into the details of her continued detention . #% The core issue we are dealing with here in this report is whether to include , or exclude , self-employed drivers from the Working Time Directive . #% Mr President , it is not only a political responsibility but a moral responsibility that the European Union has to help those in straits outside its boundaries as equally as they can . #% Some EU countries are more exposed than others - Germany probably more than anyone else ; but even we in Ireland are not unaffected . #% If the President of the Council of Ministers required to see a monument to the success to the Turin conference , then obviously he would have been greatly disillusioned and disappointed here this morning when he came to report on the conference to the European Parliament . #% An ongoing flirtation in this sensitive area is a serious threat to the continued acceptance of the great European project by an increasingly Eurosceptic citizenship . #% There is total hypocrisy as regards this Parliament and what we discuss . #% I believe that the countries of the OSPAR Convention must now form broader international links with other countries along the main shipping routes of nuclear waste , which includes countries around the Panama Canal , South America , and the coast of Africa . #% At the same time we have Mr Barroso offering deals which undermine pledges given to farmers in the context of CAP reform , in order to move Prime Minister Blair on the budget . #% So while we welcomed last night 's announcement from the American side of a six months delay , we are fundamentally opposed to this legislation in principle and we want to say that we think that the Americans , by bullying their allies , have not found the correct way forward . #% Although the term ` sustainable development ' is only now reaching treaty - and we are pleased about that - quite clearly there is an obligation on us , under the Treaty , to take into account those other matters . #% The approach of these reports is based on the need to create a system of transparency and understanding , so that citizens of the European Union can be confident that when they have a legitimate complaint they have recourse to the Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions , depending on the nature of their problem . #% A project aimed at setting up a proper system for fisheries management in Guinea must be embarked upon , so as to ensure that Atlantic yellow fin tuna and big-eye tuna stocks are not increasingly over-exploited . #% In conclusion , as regards the future of Ireland within the European Union , we are fully committed to the operation of the internal market and to the single currency . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the EU 's social protection and social inclusion process is core to ensuring the achievement of the European Union 's strategic goal of sustained economic growth , more and better jobs and greater social cohesion . #% I congratulate this motion for deploring violence , for its support of the UN and AU missions to Sudan . #% We had a very plain example where I come from - in Northern Ireland - over the last few weeks , where cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána in the south made it possible to apprehend , bring back and prevent entering the market millions upon millions of cigarettes . #% Finally , I should like to ask whether it is the politics of the scientific community or the science of the political community that is holding up the SAM legislation , because every time we delay these things , again we raise doubts in the consumer 's mind . #% It is imperative that the work begins on the Dublin light transit system known as Luas before the millennium . #% There is one further point to bear in mind . #% Therefore , I support the proposal contained in paragraph 10 of the report which calls for any state to be excluded which clearly fails to respect human rights , democracy and the rule of law from ASEM activities . #% Clearly , this means radical change in the production and consumption of energy . #% My own party in Ireland has pioneered such legislation . #% The only successful way to achieve implementation of any eventual discard ban will be through the involvement of the fishermen in monitoring and controlling and , above all , by peer pressure to ensure a level playing field . #% The more recent day-at-sea approach does not guarantee environmentally friendly fishing and bizarrely rewards the use of smaller mesh . #% Cabin crew are the only safety professionals with dual responsibilities . #% Because of the dangers which are present because of lack of proper controls and rest periods for people involved in the transport sector , it is essential that we have common regulation across the European Union . #% This is a matter of great concern to most citizens . #% However , although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries , it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly . #% We have no indigenous car manufacturing plants , not even assembly plants . #% They pass through seven boroughs , including West Hampstead , Islington , Hackney , Hammersmith , Fulham , Wandsworth and Bromley . #% I can not work out whether there is a proposal to provide new moneys to compensate the displaced fishermen or whether the Commissioner is saying that the governments of the States concerned - be it France , the United Kingdom or Ireland - should propose a compensation programme using the resources already provided and no new money and resources are available . #% Mr President , citizenship and statehood go together ; hence the desire of the promoters of the European project to produce European citizenship . #% However , we must not take for granted the great outpouring of support from the public , who were way ahead of the politicians . #% It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system . #% But the one thing we do need for the second pillar of the rural economy is money . #% Mr President , I commence by complimenting the rapporteur , Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert , for her very practical and responsible approach to this important subject . #% I fully support the strengthening of links between European , national and regional initiatives . #% What precisely is our definition , and what are they and where are they ? #% Looking at the first 200 vacancies , the range of jobs is extensive . #% There is some confusion over the new IAEA guidelines , because the International Civil Aviation Organization 's own guidelines and requirements are not taken into consideration and that organization is very concerned . #% The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and , in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro , to quantify and analyse the effects of this , particularly as regards exchange rates . #% The Irish Government 's hear-no-evil , see-no-evil approach to illegal renditions is unconvincing and unacceptable . #% 
Compensation measures for beef price reductions are included in the new draft regulations , but more work needs to be carried out to guarantee that Irish and European farmers are fully protected when the new euro changeover takes place . #% People want a reliable postal service which will deliver their mail with the minimum of fuss and which will keep local post offices at the centre of the communities they serve . #% What we want to hear from the President-in-Office to day are specific measures for a common European strategy to save the future generation from dying from the effects of drug abuse . #% It often prolongs very real human misery but as far as I am concerned one of the major problems it provokes is that of the abduction of children . #% We want to see more effective use of funds and we do not want to see them duplicating what we do in mainstream funds or in the P & R programme but giving added value to work that is going on . #% After the attacks on the Twin Towers on that terrible day in 2001 , the United States concentrated on terrorism : where the next attack was coming from , homeland security . #% Key to these directives is that the requirements we are now laying down are stricter than those laid down by the SOLAS 90 Convention , thereby ensuring that accidents of the magnitude we have experienced in the European Community will be much less likely to happen again . #% So for those who do not want that to happen , ironically , they should support Article 175 tomorrow so that we go into conciliation and politically we decide the shape , which will not be purely Article 175 because there will have to be compromises . #% The remit of the Committee on Development is to represent their interests at European Union level and to ensure that they are kept on the EU 's political agenda . #% We have to be sure that any changes which are brought about within the European Union in the future command the goodwill and support of the citizens of the Union . #% I will be distributing to Members the article which I was asked to write for the magazine on the nuclear question so that we will not be censured in this House . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer , although I did not learn much from that answer . #% That is something we must guard against . #% I am not keen on seeing Galileo turned to military applications . #% We need to be careful as to how we deal with comments concerning food . #% We want explicitly to exclude computer methods , algorithms and mathematical models from patentability , as set out in a new Article 4 . #% We could fund certain of the poverty lines and the social exclusion lines under the Treaty , but we still need unanimity . #% It is essential to have that commitment now , at a time when the nuclear industry is saying that nuclear power can be good for Kyoto and good for the environment . #% However , we are still playing catch-up . #% That is why the message from the Committee on Budgetary Control must always be critical and risk sounding rather negative . #% In the Commission 's press release in June it noted that these two aspects have been separated . #% I would hope that Members of the House would not attribute to me things that I did not say . #% Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation . #% These reports are well drafted . #% Citizens see what is happening . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to all involved in bringing about this report . #% I am still confused about the situation in relation to mince . #% And yet what Europe is trying to find at the moment -- in order to ensure that the rich tapestry of today 's re-united Europe is properly represented within all the institutions -- is people who have opinions , people who have visions , people who can best represent the countries that nominate them . #% I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could tell me who is or was responsible for drafting the Commission 's management plan . #% We were well placed in having a large parliamentary delegation . #% It is essential to point out at this stage that asylum seekers are covered by existing conventions aimed at protecting them against persecution . #% Many of them from all communities have not received justice . #% Moreover , if the Commissioner 's new plan for a radical freeing-up of the market for cross-border services is to succeed , the free movement of skilled professionals will be vital to it . #% Furthermore , it is no secret that countries such as Iraq and North Korea have made attempts to obtain bomb-building capacity . #% All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity . #% In this debate I will restrict my comments to the issue of coherence and the linkage between regional policy and competition policy . #% There are 700 of us . #% But worst of all , tailoring your response for geopolitical reasons was a total betrayal of the principles underlying election observation , which is designed to enhance democratisation and human rights . #% Even in the Official Report it is not quite clear on some of the pages . #% Mr President , I would just like to say for clarification that I wanted Council to set a timetable . #% We extended the list of diseases ; we are conscious that Article 6 allows for emergency situations , and that is to be welcomed . #% However , those earlier directives were inadequate . #% UNIFIL II must be successful . #% However , I have to register our concerns about the financing of agriculture . #% However , the question of taxation has to remain outside the responsibility . #% Will he indicate where he stands on duty-free and will he argue for its retention at Commission level ? #% Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Belder , for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report . #% Special needs children were regularly denied appropriate education and therapy , and you left public housing lists to grow and grow . #% The last 12 months has seen so many tragedies and natural disasters that have hit parts of the world : tsunamis , drought , mudslides , floods , repeated hurricanes , typhoons and now an earthquake . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber . #% For the European Union to succeed , there must be broad economic coordination from the 25 Member States . #% I am happy to see included in this report a recommendation to Member States to improve the provision of services of general interest in rural areas , thereby promoting an equitable balance between rural and urban living , in particular for older people . #% For a shining success story of the power of immunisation and the need for development aid in general , look no further than the example of measles in Africa , where , largely due to vaccination programmes , deaths from the disease fell from 90 % between 2000 and 2006 . #% From the Commission report I am pleased to note that , globally , the results are positive . #% Could you confirm or deny that specifically ? #% Mr President , since we last met , a Member State of this Union , the Republic of Ireland , has been shamefully harbouring three convicted international terrorists . #% If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is . #% In fact , they are almost - I would respectfully suggest - weak . #% I did not hear him mention the island of Ireland . #% It portrays the abuse of alcohol as something that is acceptable in society . #% Parliament should ensure that children are more visible in budget lines and the Commission should improve its technique and develop mechanisms for dialogue with the NGOs representing children . #% One of the fundamentals of the CAP is to guarantee a secure supply of high-quality foodstuffs for our citizens and I hope that the Commission will take on board the concerns of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which will no doubt be supported by a strong majority in this House tomorrow . #% The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs . #% I do appreciate that I arrived just as you were moving on and I also thank Mr Juncker for his answer . #% Mr President , it is regrettable , of course , that the first news we had of this report was in the media , as happened last year . #% Maybe as a last act you might do it before you leave that chair . #% 
In fact , in Ireland when we bring this issue up during the referendum process , we are told that it is not going to happen . #% Seventy-eight percent have seen pictures of the euro notes and coins and 64 % know that an Irish Pound will get you EUR 1.27 . #% Some of my colleagues have already touched on the points . #% It is essential that annual reports are submitted by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council , as is specified . #% While I am disappointed that the peace talks in America last year did not culminate in a final peace settlement , they were not a complete failure either . #% However , I believe that our common interests and concerns are best served by the European Union and the US Government working more closely together on a wide-ranging set of issues . #% Article 109k ( 6 ) provides for precisely such a possibility . #% That may be true of Hong Kong , but not in Ireland , where a sugar industry that supported 3 500 families has just been wiped out . #% I hope you will bear that in mind and make sure it does not happen again . #% In relation to Natura 2000 , the Teesmouth and Cleveland coasts have been classified as special protection areas under that programme . #% How it is funded hardly makes it more or less ethical . #% I am further disappointed at the hypocritical stance adopted by the Irish Government . #% When he started off in this job many years ago , he came forward with many legislative proposals which many people in this Parliament said were pie in the sky and would never be achieved . #% That , after all , is an objective of the Lisbon process . #% There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this . #% Energy efficiency is of fundamental importance both to the environmental and the competitiveness policies of the European Union . #% If you have no competition , you will have no service innovation , but if you have cut-throat competition , you will not have service innovation either . #% When Member States signed up to the Edinburgh Agreement , they knew the commitments they were entering into ; they knew they had to meet the convergence criteria and it is simply not good enough now to make a linkage which is not in the interests of our regional policy programmes . #% Last night Commissioner Byrne rejected the idea that the pharmaceutical industry had anything to do with this , but I wonder why they are so interested in getting this through if that is not the case ? #% From the Minister 's reply , I take it that assistance in this area would be an immediate priority as part of the EU 's monitoring of issues in relation to persons with mental disabilities in Romania . #% May I tell the experts that Mr Chichester has mentioned , who say the industry is highly regulated , that the Titanic was the most highly regulated ship in the world and it sank . #% Since the Tampere Summit , and following the September 11 and March 11 atrocities in the USA and Madrid , there is an understandable wish to take action against alleged criminals and terrorists . #% Very close to our hearts in the Parliament , was the emphasis on the need for community involvement and good government in order to improve the working of local democracy . #% This reform will have major political significance , not just for our future relations with East European countries , but also for our rural areas , for food policy and for the millions of farmers and workers involved . #% It is always there , but local and national bodies can stand up to criticism better perhaps than this younger institution of the European Union , which is less accepted . #% It is now time for all those involved in EU decision-making to demonstrate the necessary discipline and patience to avoid further failures and to await the report of the presidency to the Spring Summit . #% Firstly , a common consolidated tax base cuts across national sovereignty and subsidiarity . #% These systems need to be modernised and centralised so as to guarantee that flights are not delayed because of air traffic control deficiencies . #% I am pleased to support Mr Hegyi 's report , but regret that due to the application of Rule 45 ( 2 ) , I was denied the opportunity to debate it . #% CAP should be reformed to pay farmers for the delivery of public goods , such as an attractive countryside rich in biodiversity . #% in writing . - It is timely indeed that Parliament addresses this matter only days after the agreement between President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel to seek to change the Lisbon Treaty in order to provide for an orderly handling of future sovereign debt crises in the eurozone . #% My main reason for doing so was because of the legal uncertainty which is created by the imposition of a patent on software development , particularly when we can see the rapid advance of technology and the new small and medium sized enterprises that are starting up to create software packages specific to certain sectors of industry or business , or merely to create a new game for them to play themselves . #% I wish to assure him that the aim of the European Union is to encourage progress in the process of democratization and the protection of human rights in Turkey . #% I personally favour cracking down on misleading and deceptive practices rather than attempting to achieve a common definition of fair commercial practice . #% We acknowledge the progress which has been made to date by Albania in reforming its economy and in seeking to move towards a multi-party democracy . #% Now that culture was breached quite clearly at Tokaimura this week . #% We have to look clearly at our policy in the Middle East and elsewhere . #% This leads to serious misunderstanding and mistrust . #% To do otherwise would be to give the power of veto to any eurosceptic Member State . #% Even the United States has at least halted new investment . #% The health problems associated with obesity are well known : heart disease , strokes , high cholesterol and diabetes top the list . #% I believe that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect all interests . #% Madam President , Mr Wynn 's report is consistent with the very high standard we have come to expect from him in this House . #% According to the most recent Eurostat estimate , average income per full-time job equivalent , adjusted to inflation , fell by 0.6 % in Ireland in 2003 , compared to an average increase of 0.9 % in the EU as a whole . #% This , in our view , is a bad legislative proposal because it is too complex . #% I also supported a number of amendments to this report opposing increases in MEP salaries and allowances . #% Cooperation to tackle this problem is imperative . #% In more recent years , production and sale of these products have become more structured and commercialised . #% It is actually a modest programme , with EUR 200 million allocated for four years , which is frankly still inadequate . #% As you may be aware , Mr President , the three men involved were convicted in Colombia of assisting FARC terrorists there . #% This will perhaps require some re-allocation of resources . #% British Aerospace is responsible for arming the Indonesians ... #% I thought that maybe Mr Corbett , drawing on the experience of his own party back in the United Kingdom , was going to suggest that we could fund this endeavour by creating an upper House and then selling the membership to the highest bidder , it would not be totally out of place with some of the things that go on in this place . #% This must be made clear at the ESA ministerial meeting . #% If we want to ensure that the regulations are there to create a level playing field within the EU , we have to see to it that our inspectors have sufficient resources to be able to meet our expectations . #% The objective of the SMA , was supposed to give implementation to the Monti report which had as main concern to re-launch the Single Market . #% That will be challenged before the European Court of Justice , as we have been told , and we know the countries that are going to do it . #% We must take the precautionary approach . #% On the last point that you made with regard to the rules concerning excessive public deficits and the fact that proposals have been made to Italy , Portugal , Hungary and the United Kingdom , what about France and Germany ? #% I do not know about you but , as I said , I was very disappointed that a figure of at most EUR 40 million over three years for 27 Member States was all that divided us . #% We very much welcome and deeply thank the Commission for this , and the Council of Ministers for the Special Peace Programme for Northern Ireland . #% It is bad for Britain , bad for Europe and will only prolong the crisis . #% To ask farmers to increase their scale to make up that difference is just neither practical nor possible . #% There are two main reasons for this , neither of which has anything to do with the lack of a communication strategy . #% Like him , I am pleased that we have a result , although I recommend acceptance with a rather heavy heart . #% I call on my own Irish Government to support this working time directive in line with the rapporteur ' s suggestions . #% 
The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment . #% I hope that the fact we have already done something to deal with the problem of these wretched plastic bags will not be held against us in relation to targets . #% You can only govern with the consent of the people and by 2010 domestic water charges could well be acceptable to the Irish electorate . #% Mr President , as the late Tip O'Neill said : ' All politics is local ' . #% I voted for this report but abstained on some amendments as they were part of the negotiated package on the compromise amendments . #% However , I do not believe for one minute that it justifies in any circumstances what has happened in Pakistan in recent weeks . #% You refer to the fact that gaps exist and you wish to address to them but the greatest gap is that in the willingness of your collegiate body to come before this House constantly in an open , transparent and clear way . #% We must ensure that fishermen ' s rights to earn their living are not hindered by ridiculous regulation . #% Therefore it is important that one has a unit in prisons where the prisoners themselves can make a choice against drugs . #% If that is true , I should then like to suggest that we change our order of business for today and , respecting the 24-hour deadline , I would ask the rapporteur , Mrs Buitenweg , to introduce her report at 3 p.m. , followed by a debate , urgencies and then the vote , which would fully respect the 24-hour deadline . #% I appreciate the enormous difficulties . #% My own group , which is of divided opinion on the matter , has a minority who intended to vote against paragraph 8 , and did so . #% In Ireland last year , 1 947 women and 3 269 children were admitted to refuges . #% I should like to thank my colleagues , particularly Mrs Fourtou , Mr Oreja , Mr Manders and Mrs Echerer , for supporting this initiative for a written declaration . #% The last point I want to address is the failure of the Court of Auditors to give a statement of assurance . #% They are the people who cadged money from abroad in the interests of breaking up the solidarity of the people of Europe and spent it to tell lies to the Irish people , while the Irish government - and , unfortunately , the opposition - were so complacent that we thought everybody would trust us . #% As a representative of Irish fishermen I have no difficulty with it at all . #% in writing . - Climate change is a real and immediate challenge that the countries of Europe are facing . #% Must we wait for years more of serious risk to the health and environment of people in the British Isles and Europe generally ? #% I have no difficulty if three-fifths or three-sixths or three-sevenths of the Parliament decide to terminate such offices , but if the Conference of Presidents does so it is absolutely crazy . #% Operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in , and out-of-date equipment . #% The reason why I have supported quotas is - as I am sure is the case for many other colleagues - because we can not necessarily trust our own broadcasters not to take the easy option when it comes to cheap programming . #% There are a number of amendments that could solve this problem so we can have a balanced , workable EU law which will not permit backdoor patenting but will ensure that , in an increasingly cut-throat and global arena , Europe 's most inventive companies can have access to patents and challenge US dominance in this field . #% There has been much debate in recent months about the strength or otherwise of the currency and I would like to pose a very simple question to the detractors of EMU . #% This is best shown by the scale of debt that they now owe . #% The total number of Aids sufferers worldwide has now reached 40 million and continues to rise . #% I note what the Commissioner has just said concerning the conclusions of the 2000 review : ` the system works well , the results were good , the system is up and running ' . #% Our economies will recover , but our environment will not ... #% Food is an internationally tradeable product and with consumers crossing frontiers on a daily basis , nothing short of a co-ordinated and common approach to food safety as spearheaded by the EU will restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain , and while there is a cost factor , particularly for farmers , it is I believe strongly in the interests of agriculture and individual farm families , that full confidence is restored as quickly as possible in all agricultural products . #% It is important that the citizens of Europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a European Union level . #% Finally , could I say that if we are to guarantee the success of these measures then it must be done on a tripartite basis with national , local and European involvement . #% The current Draconian restrictions on people 's movements can not continue . #% We appear to be doing the same in Kosovo . #% The Commission is talking about a harmonised taxation system , but wherever harmonised taxation has taken place it has been contrary to good competition , economic growth and employment growth . #% However , if 2001 is a repeat of 2000 , then no one should be surprised if fishermen lend their support to calls for emergency aid along the lines of that enjoyed by the agriculture sector for so long and by fishing fleets in other parts of the Community ' . #% The amendments we tabled and which have been taken on board by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights will hopefully help to bring about the free movement of workers , as Ms Oddy mentioned , and these people will be able to practice anywhere in the Community . #% A final comment : without farmers there would be no environment . #% Al Qaeda represents evil of a barbaric nature and for Al Qaeda human life means absolutely nothing . #% What people were asked to decide on in Nice are new ways of running the EU , which are unacceptable . #% I also very much welcome the inclusion of sustainability objectives and the equal status given to sustainability together with competition and with security of supply . #% Still we trumpet human rights and democracy clauses in partnership agreements with third countries , but non-compliance largely seems to go unmarked . #% I hope that the Commission can accept the rapporteur 's amendments , which improve the Commission 's proposal . #% The Finnish Presidency of the EU , together with the Commission , should review progress that is being made on this important issue across the EU so that consumer concerns about the new euro currency are fully addressed . #% When the people who oppose this Treaty and have opposed other treaties say that this will override national law , this issue has already been decided . #% It is a `` yes '' to make sure that we meet the political conditions agreed in Helsinki that we in the EU should be ready , no later than the end of 2002 , for this historic journey towards enlargement . #% To conclude these brief remarks , I commend the Brok report to the House . #% The financial services industry must certainly put its house in order and ensure ethical conduct and diligence to protect the jobs and savings of millions of people . #% I have seen documents from the works council that suggest that production will be moved to India . #% Could I put it simply for them , because it seems to be very difficult for them to understand : do they argue that the World Cup should be lost because the first team that plays should lose if it does not score the first goal , or should the game go its full term and should every qualified team play the complete game to the end ? #% Why , therefore , is it the case that we in Parliament are not looking at that ? #% Finally , there is only one person in the room tonight who will have a vote in my election : Commissioner Flynn will have the opportunity to vote for me . #% I ask you to consider the World AIDS Day tomorrow , 1 December . #% If the single currency is not working , why are so many countries seeking to join the new structure ? #% I welcome the partial lifting of the ban . #% For example , some rare breeds of cattle , now almost extinct , may provide disease resistant traits and food producing improvements when cross-bred with conventional breeds . #% Mr President , I should like to support what the other speakers have said . #% We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive , as it were , to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be . #% Some inspectors think that it will actually have a negative effect . #% Can we not invite him ? #% When we reduce the European Security and Defence Policy to the somewhat farcical theatre of presence or absence at the dining policy at Downing Street , we diminish the idea of Europe itself and we need , from the top down , at the level of the European Council , a commitment to an internally consistent and coherent sense of Europe . #% In its own right , it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas . #% You have only to look at the fact that 400 000 EU-educated researchers are working in the United States today . #% I believe that Israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of Lebanon . #% Commissioner , when Mr Mandelson trades off the last Irish cow , what do you expect we will get ? #% The EU exports about 500 , 000 live animals annually . #% There are areas that are open to improvement . #% 
Even if there is room for argument about whether the Commission was right or wrong , for our minister in his arrogance and our Tanaiste to pretend that they could not accept or understand that was dishonest and unfair . #% We need more education programmes . #% Mr President , I regret the vote that took place today . #% Frankly , if we were to be paid nothing there are some begrudgers and commentators who would still raise questions . #% Is there any chance that a portion of the transfer fee for under-23s might go directly to the amateur club which nurtured their skills ? #% These small quantities are further diluted to almost non-existence . #% I strongly believe that the European Union and the American government have mutually important roles to play in ending the violence in the region and restarting meaningful peace talks . #% As has been noted , the title of this proposed directive , which will overhaul the existing mutual assistance directive , is slightly misleading , given that it will only , in effect , apply to direct taxation and insurance , indirect taxation in the form of VAT and excise duties being dealt with in separate instruments . #% I will not pretend to be happy with this situation . #% As currently framed they would be disastrous for Irish agriculture and the towns and villages of rural Ireland . #% The more accurate and reliable the information provided is , then the better our environmental policies will be . #% Simultaneously , the peace process can be reactivated on the basis of the so-called roadmap , which has been accepted by the two sides . #% It was a good thing that the number of farms was reduced and that we had the common agricultural policy to ease that . #% This report talks about supporting the Franco-British Declaration at St. Malo and also of the speedy integration of the Western European Union into the EU . #% My country is one of the ten member states with a vehicle registration tax . #% The Commission , while allowing this to happen , adopts an entirely different attitude to the pig producers of Northern Ireland . #% Not all the progress has yet been measured . #% What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance ? #% I believe in containment and recovery as very sensible and effective means of mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases . #% These amendments acknowledge the exploitative and ethically controversial nature of embryonic procurement and research and recognise that in order to fully respect the subsidiarity principle , EU funds should not be distributed to research that is illegal in various Member States . #% The local bishop , who is the chairman of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission , recently said , and it is very telling : ' what we are experiencing at the moment is a reign of tyranny and oppression that surpasses anything that we have encountered in the days of oneparty rule . ' #% Members should remember this when we are voting on the budget this year for the Cork Declaration to ensure we can encourage industry and people to come back to rural areas . #% That is what the House is voting for . #% I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion . #% None of our citizens knew how that decision was made . #% Could it not have been made to coincide with the ending of the HELIOS programme ? #% Given the extent of monetary policy integration foreseen by the single currency project , it is vital that its economic policy counterparts , as they emerge , should involve all the institutions of the Union . #% This should ideally be part of a global solution , with industry and governments sitting down with the International Civil Aviation Organization , as Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Kyoto Protocol suggests . #% The Cologne Council directed the Finnish government , as the office-holder of the Presidency , to establish the conditions for the implementation of this project in time for the Tampere Summit . #% The local post office in rural communities is a vital economic , social and cultural institution and the rights of rural dwellers to postal services can not be ignored when framing liberalisation plans for those services in the EU . #% If we have to have some difficult debates , for God 's sake , let us have them in September and let us have it out in September so that we do not have some form of institutional guerilla warfare right through to December or January . #% However powerful we may consider ourselves to be in this Parliament , we can not legislate for sunshine or rain across 25 Member States . #% Mr President , congratulations to Mrs Plooij , who is a good speaker , but more importantly , a very good listener . #% I can not assure her that the Council of Ministers would agree . #% We are delighted that Mr Gusmão has received this award . #% Furthermore , there is still a concern within Europe with regard to a few sensitive national concerns . #% It is heartening to see so many agricultural MEPs here from all the groups supporting the protection of agriculture . #% But what do the people in the gallery , what do the men and women in the street care about in terms of their own television ? #% If they can be encouraged to give their support by starting their training in schools , the good practice will be continued in the home . #% The creation of Europol represented a major step forward in this context . #% I also wish to thank the Secretariat for its input . #% If they are , they should not be , as the payments can only be made to active producers , who farm and keep land in good agricultural condition . #% It is hiding , for trade reasons , behind the governments in China , Russia , India and Malaysia , which said that they would protect the Sudanese Government and veto sanctions against it . #% I certainly share the concerns expressed by the honourable Member . #% The difficulty and danger is that once you transfer the right and entitlement to a quota , then all production stops and sugar production is amalgamated into big multinational interests , rather than into individual national interests as at present . #% Yesterday , as on many previous occasions , there was no interpretation into or out of Finnish or Swedish in the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , despite the fact that a member of the committee from Finland was presenting a report and had to deal with very detailed amendments . #% The Commission first submitted a proposal in 1991 , which was withdrawn after Parliament , under pressure from environmental groups , rejected the Council 's common position in 1996 . #% Mr President , you will recall that since Christmas this House has taken a special interest in the case of Roisín McAliskey who was incarcerated in Holloway Prison in England . #% - I was disappointed to see that in the decision of Parliament and Council establishing the `` Youth '' Community action programme , reference to the family has been removed in final conciliation negotiations . #% In Ireland car users utilizing mobile phones when driving can be prosecuted for careless driving under the Road Traffic Act of 1961 . #% The most important thing is that we reach a fair compromise that is the best option available for this House and for the citizens we represent , while noting what our colleague , Mr Szájer has said . #% I support the compromise on registration , together with the amendment to limit the cost for SMEs , and the minimisation of animal testing . #% We must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world . #% Mr President , the details of the European Constitution are extremely important . #% Its stability directly impinges on the whole region and the EU has rightly attempted to build contacts and a relationship with this geographically close and significant neighbour . #% All Member States are represented in the Council of Ministers , the European Commission and the European Parliament . #% This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us . #% So much for Sinn Féin 's pretence to be a normal political party . #% History has consistently shown that the correct approach is to stand up to a bully . #% The sooner we , as a world community , wake up to this reality , the less will be the need to produce and to adopt the crisis-management measures that we are debating and , hopefully , adopting today . #% . Mr President , I am pleased and relieved to have an opportunity to speak in favour of the joint resolution . #% In addition , would it be possible to make displaying or advertising pre-tax prices along with post-tax prices obligatory ? #% I support this programme because of its social values . #% If our constituents saw us in this light they would be very impressed . #% Some of the speeches in the Chamber here and some of the lobbying material I have received over the last few weeks on this issue concern protecting small and medium-sized enterprises . #% Madam President , I would like to have talked in general terms but , given recent developments in my own country , I will confine my remarks to our future strategy . #% 
How will they be discussed in the Council ? #% Instead , our priority should be to improve the situation of asylum-seekers in the Member States . #% Companies need to understand that late payment is not good credit management . #% On the matter of implementation : Carrying suitcases from summit to summit does nothing . #% At the last plenary session I tabled a question to the Council , in time and in full accordance with the Rules , yet the Presidency refused to answer the question because they had not received all language translations . #% The Bolkestein proposal was flawed because it failed to recognise that if you want the public to support the opening-up of the market you have to convince them of the benefits and reassure them that it will not undermine working or consumer rights . #% In the intervening 80 years , the ILO has responded to the needs of people all around the globe for decent jobs , livelihoods and dignity . #% It also ignores the plans that are forging ahead on the Enfopol interception system in the EU . #% We , who are fortunate enough to be born into a part of the world where there are no food shortages , drought or famine , have a moral responsibility to work towards a more just world . #% Mr President , I want to welcome Mr Söderman this morning and to congratulate Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors for their reports . #% Fluoride , as we use it in Ireland , is a toxic waste taken from the scrubbers of an artificial fertilizer factory , which also contain poison like mercury and cadmium . #% I can join with the honourable Member in expressing absolute condemnation of this arrest and arrests of this kind . #% Ms Buitenweg 's report clearly demarks certain areas to remain part of the competency of each Member State , but progress on a European scale is important to achieve a social and more just Europe . #% Recent events in Burma also show the need for decisive action at EU level . #% It is about time that the Commission had the courage to present that report and its scientific findings to Parliament so that we can deal with that particular matter . #% Thankfully , it would now seem that we are learning our lessons . #% In relation to coastal zones it is extremely important . #% Maybe , when we speak about design and energy-efficient design , those kinds of design features should be taken out of televisions and radios and computers , so that there is no standby . #% Over the years of our existence we have managed to put in place environmental and social rules alongside trade rules . #% I obviously have a particular concern in that this crisis is threatening a EUR 15bn food industry in the Republic of Ireland because of the steps we have had to take to ensure that foot-and-mouth disease does not get a hold there . #% My biggest concern relates to who is monitoring the control bodies and who is checking the auditors . #% Clearly the events of the Brussels summit of EU leaders last December are now well behind us . #% The President-in-Office has admitted there will be job losses and also that we can put off this decision until such time as there is harmonisation of taxation - particularly excise duty . #% They have only dealt with the macro-economic issues at the level of a national economy and ignored the regional impact of EMU , or have ignored the relationship between EMU and cohesion policy . #% The proposal to effectively freeze the size of the European Union budget to 1.27 % of the European GDP means that there will have to be a cut in real terms in the size of the structural funds package available to encourage economic growth in the less developed regions of the present 15 Member States . #% There is nothing else in sight . #% This could be best achieved by first ensuring that the interests and concerns of the citizens of each of our countries are made known at the highest level in the Commission . #% I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation . #% Making producers responsible for their own brand products will lead to improvements of design and have a direct effect on the costs . #% So there is a major problem of what actually constitutes acceptable ID . #% Is it not about time we became masters of our own policy , our own approach , our own attitude in foreign affairs ? #% If the Commissioner is not in a position to provide me with the information today , will he undertake to write to me on that subject ? #% When the European Council meets next week , it -- and the Commission -- will need to bear in mind that driving forward with market reforms without strengthening the democratic , social and environmental dimension of Europe , will feed the current crisis , and indeed , that strengthening nationalism will destroy Europe . #% It is my belief that if the European Union is to work , we have to strengthen and deepen the relationships between this Parliament and the national parliaments . #% in writing . - My colleague , Mr Harbour , has presented an own-initiative report regarding increasing innovation in Europe to ensure sustainable and high-quality public services . #% Will the Members have that direct access to the committee to give an opinion on any specific issue , not through the Commission ? #% The role of the Ombudsman 's office clearly is to ensure that there is good administration by the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council . #% Mr President , that is my point : it should not purport to be an official magazine and should not carry the masthead or purport to represent the views of this House . #% The amount allocated falls somewhat short of initial expectations . #% In approving the setting-up of Eurojust , I believe we would be adding a new weapon to take on Europe 's criminal organisations . #% There are a lot of covert subsidies to the nuclear sector that have been there for a long time and that are long overdue for a considerable review if not a total ban . #% Furthermore , if the European Union is to become more responsible and flexible to the global current of market change , I propose to the Commission that a review clause be introduced into all new legislation . #% If we are encouraging our SMEs to compete within the single market , we must at least be able to guarantee their protection against these appalling scams . #% The Greens are not against fishing or trying to close down fisheries to protect some species . #% Oil is a costly , non-renewable energy source , which should not be used wastefully . #% I was delighted yesterday to see the Council and the Commission here continuing the support which they have always given to the Northern Ireland peace process . #% Who shall speak for you ? #% While recognising that it may be a diplomatic formality , as we say in the resolution , at the same time it is very effective and signals a change of opinion in the United States . #% Mr President , I have been watching this whole business of Structural Funds and additionality for many years , and there are a number of things that we can learn from the past . #% Is this really what you want ? #% That is the first thing I would like to know from the Council , in relation to the current situation in Iraq , which definitely can not be left in the hands of the British and the Americans . #% I am glad to see here today that the tobacco industry did not get its way and that Parliament put the interests of the health of people throughout Europe before vested interests . #% Taking a position on euthanasia is not a responsibility of the European Parliament . #% The industry comprises more than 21 000 firms providing 530 000 jobs , with a turnover in excess of EUR 72 billion . #% Finally , I also believe it was a serious mistake to back off from a decision to nominate a European Union peace-keeping force for Afghanistan under a UN mandate . #% We need to create proper conditions for full and stable employment to improve quality and productivity at work and labour market cohesion . #% The Council will be following developments closely with a view to taking further action if such action is considered appropriate . #% Healthcare should never be treated as a commercial market service . #% I think it is appalling that vested interests within governments and countries are totally disregarding the health of people throughout Europe . #% The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic : 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year , equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches . #% Do you share my concerns that economic growth is not converting to jobs ? #% AIDS , malaria and TB still claim some four million lives a year . #% In return , European citizens will receive not just reliable , high-quality goods which are guaranteed to have been farmed to the EU 's high standards of practice , but will also benefit from the societal and cultural implications of the CAP , such as those contained in Pillar II . #% I have to say , with the greatest of respect for France and her people , that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative , and I think it deeply unwise . #% I call , therefore , for the programme to be gradually opened to all countries covered by the EU 's Neighbourhood Policy . #% Therefore , the ending of some of these aids so suddenly could potentially have a serious effect on some of the Member States in the EU , but it is important for the sector to realise that they should not rely solely on these aids in the future . #% 
The implementation and operation of the guidelines can not be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service . #% Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported . #% I know the Commissioner will tell us the tale about interinstitutional agreements , the Council , the Commission , precedence and practice . #% Can the Commissioner comment on the validity and logic of a policy that compels Member States to radically reduce emissions with resulting increases in EU energy prices and lower manufacturing output while , at the same time , we promote trade with and production in China , the world 's greatest polluter , with no enforceable requirements for the suppression of emissions from them . #% They can institute a policy of prompt payment without the need for EU legislation . #% I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX . #% I come from a country that has benefited from the EU 's structural funds . #% It is unfounded to make allegations like that . #% We must address this problem urgently . #% However , the Council has flatly rejected all amendments on democratic scrutiny and delegated acts , without proposing any alternative solution which would satisfy Parliament 's demands . #% Secondly , environmental standards . #% Madam President , my point concerns the section of the Minutes on Question Time yesterday evening , when I raised a point of order . #% It focuses on non-technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted . #% It has been a marvellous presidency and I want to pay tribute to you personally , Mr Cook , for your courage in taking on very major issues . #% The Commissioner emphasised that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth , competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run . #% In conclusion , the scale of employee participation will be decided through free negotiations between the companies concerned and the workers . #% We must allow research to continue in order to relieve the suffering of the millions with serious diseases and spinal injuries , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , motor neurone disease , diabetes , cancer , heart disease : the list is endless . #% Would he not agree that he should be leading to ensure that in the light of international terrorism he takes a positive role and does not try to duck out of this position ? #% Can I say in general terms , that we are all very concerned about employment , but the reality is that we do not do what we should do . #% Having discussed this with Mrs Roth-Berendt , we have tabled Amendment No 51 to Article 5 as a compromise to this effect . #% We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable . #% Those of us who are not scientists must rely on the judgment and evaluation of professionally qualified people . #% I welcome the strong commitment given by AKP deputy leader Mr Abdullah Gul during his recent visit to Brussels to continue with the reform programme . #% Do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control ? #% I do not understand what has happened . #% The new EU-Canada Partnership Agenda was launched under the Irish presidency in Ottawa on 18 March 2004 . #% I hope those aspects of the report will be taken on board by the Commission . #% Each of the national governments had nominated the people they considered to be the best for the position of Commissioner in the European Union . #% My group would like to extend its sympathy to the citizens of Göteborg on a very difficult moment in a wonderful host city . #% Ireland , perhaps more than any other EU Member State , bears witness to the practical realisation of the aspirations and dreams of the EU 's founding fathers . #% In relation to paragraph 5 , I need guidance from the Commission . #% I hope these very positive moves will translate into practice on the ground very soon . #% I hope the President will inform us of the reasons for the allocation of these contracts and the savings made . #% As a non-aligned country , Ireland should be promoting the right of the four Member States of this Union to maintain their non-aligned status within the Union instead of toeing the EU pro-military line . #% Failure to comply in one aspect of an accredited quality system has led to a major loss in confidence in BNFL overall . '' #% President Moi will have to get the message , given that the IMF and the World Bank have already suspended aid . #% Contrary to IMO conventions , the company refused to allow trade union representatives to visit the crew on board . #% This is a human rights issue and the European Union has certain possibilities open to it . #% In so doing he said : ` Linking cities and villages into this busy network will not only give new jobs to Ireland but will provide the one-stop media shop for local services in health , education , tourism , business development and all public services ' . #% Is there anything that the Commission can do and will it address my complaint speedily ? #% I do not think the Commission is actually addressing the issue . #% It would leave British ports vulnerable to takeovers similar to the takeover of various electricity firms by Electricité de France . #% To that extent there are some very welcome initiatives coming from the Andersson report and from the Commission 's Green Paper . #% You have remarked yourself , Prime Minister , that there is too little risk capital available on European capital markets . #% The Cardiff Summit has been more a stocktaking exercise than one in which major decisions have been made . #% I believe , as I have said , that we need a centralized system . #% Therefore a trade and cooperation relationship develops as a result of an agreement , yet basic and clear breaches of human rights continue ; human rights clauses are ignored or not taken seriously , but there are no consequences . #% I am very pleased about the attention that is now being given to the theme of gender balance , of mainstreaming throughout the Community 's policies , including the Fifth Framework Programme . #% Is there a difference between DG Enterprise and DG Environment on this issue , and has DG Enterprise won the battle ? #% This is taking foolishness to the extreme and I ask you to reflect and take on board the views of the committee and the view of this Parliament on this particular point . #% We have to try to find ways by which we can control the disease of BSE and TSE and at the same time create the consumer confidence that is needed because consumer confidence has been lost . #% Up to 30 000 lives were lost in the capital alone that day and the event signalled the decline of the city , which until then had been the fourth largest city in Europe and one of the richest . #% Firstly , I would like to draw attention to the debate taking place in relation to the future financing of the European Union 's annual budget . #% Alongside this threat , we do not have clarity as to who actually owns the sugar quota ; I think it is essential that the quota be vested in growers of beet . #% It is right and proper to condemn and continue to condemn the atrocity of 11 September 2001 and all other atrocities engineered by terrorists , whether in the United States or in Europe , in Spain , Ireland or indeed in Israel or the Palestinian territories . #% Many women do not want to undertake motherhood without an involved father . #% In the past year children who have been missing - in some cases for up to 18 months - have been recovered . #% Finally , once again I express my deepest gratitude to you all for the great support that you give to peace on my own streets . #% As a result of what I saw then I deliberately set out to give longer time to develop an alternative method of trapping in order to cause the minimum amount of difficulty to the indigenous people in Canada . #% The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty . #% I will give you further information about this . #% Coordination of national regulators will provide for more flexibility within the single market , which is welcome . #% We have made the point that they must be targeted . #% It is not civil servants who are to blame for the problems , but their political masters . #% Who would have forecast all this in 1941 , with the second world war raging and millions being slaughtered . #% A special Euro barometer on EMF indicated that Europeans are divided in their concerns about the potential health risks of EMF : 14 % not at all concerned , 35 % not very concerned , 35 % fairly concerned and 13 % very concerned . #% 
I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired . #% Now that the EU petition has been tabled with the WTO , I plead with the Commission to defend vigorously the vital interests of European and , indeed , Irish agriculture . #% I would name Finland , Sweden and countries like the Republic of Ireland , which have made good progress . #% That debate should be in public . #% I urge you , Mr President , to ensure in future that where a Member has to present a report they are able to do so in their own language even if this means taking interpreting staff from another committee for the period concerned . #% In that context , the role of politicians is to look at economic fundamentals in the real economy ; the role of politicians is to achieve an appropriate level of convergence ; the role of politicians is to define what is the desirable level of price stability internally . #% Actually , judging by demonstrations that took place in the major cities of Israel , there are many Israeli citizens who publicly oppose their Government 's action . #% I was guided by these particular principles when I voted on this important report . #% Therefore it is all the more bizarre that the Council of Ministers and the Member States that compose it wish to repatriate money where it does not have that added value . #% A few months ago it , along with the US company UNOCAL , signed a new contract with Burmese oil and gas enterprises to expand natural gas explorations in the Andaman Sea . #% The failure to update and review it , to protect people from the effects of radiation rather than to promote nuclear power , is extraordinary . #% The new constitution is nothing to be proud of for anyone who believes in democratic control and its essential companion , national sovereignty . #% I conclude by saying that I have no time for the arguments of those who view enlargement in selfish nationalist budgetary terms . #% We have moved from a time when there was heavy industrialised and intensive labour areas of industry , to other smaller networks , smaller cooperation . #% I am curious and dumbfounded that some of my colleagues on the left in the GUE/NGL Group also seem to think the report is irrelevant , but perhaps that is a reflection of the point I made that the dividing line between left and right is changing in this modern world of ours and that it is not that there are no differences but that the lines are shifting . #% There was huge psychological damage , in particular to farmers and their families when they had to depopulate or destroy their animals . #% This call for reconciliation and coexistence must be welcomed by all interested parties . #% I would like a response from the Commission in view of the opinion of the Advocate-General , delivered on 20 September last , on the preliminary ruling on the invalidity of Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation ( EC ) No 925/99 on restricting the use of aircraft at European airports in the interests of protection against noise . #% From an Irish perspective , we are deeply concerned about the safety and security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria . #% In some cases , detainees ' family members have been arrested merely because of their connection to the accused . #% He had to leave earlier this afternoon and he forgot to sign a letter asking for me to take his question on his behalf . #% There are those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is destined to fail as the rest of the world waits for those nations already taking part to fall short of their obligations and so provide the perfect cover for their decision not to participate in the first place . #% The European approach in opening up energy markets and making them more efficient is well balanced . #% What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain 's nuclear installations ? #% Health and safety in the workplace can only be maintained where adequate monitoring is conducted at workplace level . #% The vote on this report will show who in practice is in favour of freedom of competition when it serves consumers and small businesses and who , on the other hand , supports legal protection of multinational monopolies . #% It will also take into account the principles of sustainable or environmentally friendly development set out in the Gothenburg strategy . #% In particular , they should now consider bringing in flexibility with regard to the compensation payments to sugar beet growers and sugar producers who have lost their livelihoods , and targeting those resources instead towards the creation of alternative energy crops and alternative fuels . #% I congratulate Prime Minister Vanhanen . #% Looking at the different Presidency programmes -- whether the Finnish Presidency , the previous Austrian Presidency or even the advance programme for the German Presidency -- we can often see continuity in one area , but we can also see the individuality of the country taking over the Presidency . #% This really falls short of what we are required to do under international law . #% I also endorse the use of qualified majority voting to achieve an effective common foreign and security policy , and the incorporation of the WEU under the European pillar . #% This and other issues should have a democratic airing and this is the place to do so at a European level . #% It must also be put on the record that from the moment of the first suspected case of BSE in my country we implemented a full-herd slaughter programme . #% The Dutch have a bigger surplus still , something like 35 billion . #% Let me immediately state that I support the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which call for the need to coordinate broad economic policies of the various participating Member States within the single European currency . #% They had not informed Parliament that this demonstration was going to take place yesterday . #% If the EU is serious about increasing recycling , reducing waste and limiting air emissions and climate change , then it must take action . #% EUR 680 million of co-financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin , the east and the south . #% We need a European ferries directive to ensure that Irish Ferries and other companies like it can not ride roughshod over the rights of workers present and future . #% The skills and the experience of the workforce and the major capital investment could and should be redirected towards waste management and the creation of a centre of excellence for decommissioning and that is what I suggest we concentrate the debate on . #% Their concerns are rather more basic . #% There are a number of aspects of this resolution , in relation also to defence budgets , which promote the militarisation of Europe . #% Today we had to vote for the third time on what was basically the same issue . #% Only last week the Agriculture Council adopted conclusions on the European Union forestry action policy . #% These proposals are flawed and will not achieve the aim of sustainable development . #% Already we have seen a generation of children with grotesque and life-threatening malformations . #% Human Rights Watch did not respond . #% I welcome the fact that the European Council , with the encouragement of the European Commission , adopted the date of the next European election as a target timetable , all the while emphasising and respecting the fact that we should continue with a case by case analysis based on differentiation . #% These issues can not be addressed in a piecemeal manner . #% I believe that the recent readmittance of Burma to the Asean and EU-Asean meetings was a major mistake from the start . #% The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic and regional cohesion and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions highly dependent on fisheries . #% This is an urgent matter . #% That should continue to be our primary objective . #% I note with satisfaction that we did not have any embarrassing incidents during the Presidency , as we have had in other recent presidencies . #% I also believe it is important that Kosovo leaders speak out clearly against the violence that is taking place in the former Republic of Yugoslavia . #% We have to address this issue . #% I feel slightly uncomfortable , given that Ireland is the home of the Dublin Convention and has only very recently begun to receive an appreciable number of refugees and asylum seekers , that unfortunately , the Dublin Convention is not working terribly well . #% Requirements for the placing of veterinary medicinal products on the market have been harmonised since the early 1980s when Council Directive 81/851 was adopted . #% Furthermore , we are calling on each Member State to ensure that convictions for such crimes are subject to the tracing , seizure and confiscation of all moveable and immovable assets representing the proceeds of those crimes . #% The Sixth Framework Programme gives us an opportunity to look at research and I hope that tomorrow , Commissioner , you will join with us in looking forward to a more intelligent use of energy in the European Union . #% That is completely unacceptable to the democratic process and our government is guilty of treachery in its approach to the Irish vote . #% in writing . - I support this report , which calls on the Member States to ensure that people , at different times of life , have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally . #% We have been to the fore with in bringing forward innovative programmes tackling common diseases such as cancer , biological hazards , risks to food and food safety , and also the ongoing problems of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease . #% We all recognise that the European Union , in spite of economic recovery , is still working well below par for too many people ; specifically for 15 million of our fellow citizens the EU is simply not working at all . #% I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety . #% 
At a recent meeting with Coillte I was told that the government is gong to challenge this decision . #% The notion that most people want judges , well-dressed lawyers and fine courtrooms as a setting to resolve their disputes is no longer correct . #% If the UN team concludes that war crimes have indeed occurred , then the international community must take action including referring the matter to the International War Crimes Tribunal . #% The European Union is in a very powerful position to do this . #% It will require education and addressing the culture that we live in ; it requires addressing the attitudes of our media . #% The waste product has an active life of thousands of years that we can neither control nor manage . #% That is something that she is right to continue to develop . #% Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market . #% Member States must ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies will provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently . #% We want to make sure that the DCI works and that its successor will work in achieving these objectives . #% I wish to thank the Commission , the Council and my colleagues , in particular the shadow rapporteurs , for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure . #% However , to have a fighting chance in such a competitive business they need access to affordable patents and assistance with legal fees to protect and enforce their patents . #% We could and should have looked at issues like ` on call time ' in relation to home carers . #% The Commission and Council have to implement full economic sanctions against Burma and prohibit any investment until the situation as regards human rights violations has been settled . #% Drug trafficking remains a massive problem and the illegal trade in small arms , whose main recipients are terrorists and criminals , is estimated to account for 10 % of the global trade in arms . #% These documents , the first of which is actually a legally-binding treaty which has been signed by the EU and all Member States , calls for measures which are more progressive than those which the Commission is requesting . #% We do not need the straw to break the camel 's back . #% In relation to the Gillig report this morning , each year we visit the whole area of further clarification of the exportability of benefits to try to achieve the goal of free movement of more and more of our citizens in the European Union . #% Africa itself is one of the centres of the best footballers in the world . #% Through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service known as MABS in Ireland , they provide access to credit for individuals who are often seriously in debt and otherwise prey to illegal money lenders providing loans at impossibly high interest rates . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking Stephen Hughes for the work he has done on this report . #% There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission . #% This is not going to be an easy task , but it must be vigorously pursued as a military option . #% The money has to be taken into account to a greater extent in the future , and we can not pretend otherwise . #% Turnout in elections is important , but people 's identity as citizens is not confined to their political identity . #% I strongly believe that efforts to isolate President Arafat will only exasperate tensions within the Palestinian leadership . #% The main problems which exist with its implementation are the slowness of the procedures , the lack of free legal aid in some of our countries , and the excessive recourse to the use of the exemption clauses . #% With the considerable help of your office and of Parliament we have had some significant successes in returning these children to their parents . #% I would remind the House that all food contains hormones . #% There is a positive side to this , namely safety . #% This is a European matter . #% But we have run into difficulties on the THERMIE project and indeed , on SYNERGIE as well because of the lack of a legal base ; and because - as has been said here today - we really do not have a common energy policy or even a working energy policy that we are harmonizing . #% Sometimes the sheepmeat regime is severely criticized because of the cost per kilo of meat produced . #% The PNR Agreement forms part of the so-called ` war on terror ' and will infringe the civil liberties of Irish citizens . #% That false message must not be allowed to be sent out from this Parliament . #% Unfortunately no technology can replace the driver 's fundamental responsibility to drive safely and adhere to the rules of the road . #% Madam President , at the risk of ruining everyone 's Christmas , I heard this morning in the hairdresser 's ... #% But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people . #% However , each individual Member can request a filter on his or her machine to prevent these completely counter-productive e-mails from coming in . #% Neither is it possible to evaluate that role in economic terms . #% How the subject of the welfare of animals during transport can be seen as more relevant to economic and monetary policy than to agricultural policy or transport policy is beyond me . #% Only last December I raised this issue in the Irish Senate and cited all the various directives - mainly environmental directives - we had failed to transpose within the timetable or years after the deadline for transposition had taken place . #% Two months ago employees were given notice that the plant would close this December . #% In February this year a number of trade unionists -- members of a peasant farmers ' association -- were arrested . #% As Mr Ford also pointed out , Michael Courtney made a valuable contribution to the current peace process in Burundi and I would hope there will be a full inquiry into his death which will bring those responsible for his death to justice . #% Whatever savings in fuel were achieved , this reckless change in standards has now cost consumers , taxpayers and especially farmers several million times more than any possible savings . #% So please come forward with a progress report , because lives are at stake . #% BSE , SARS and the recent avian influenza concerns have all , to our cost , underlined the imperative of having proactive , pre-emptive coordinated action in the area of health . #% Today , I have no doubt , the Commission and the presidency of the Union will be aware that Parliament no longer wants to fudge on the issue of Burundi . #% He rightly states that education is an essential part of the development of these countries . #% I am concerned about the role of Parliament in this whole process . #% Something which concerns me greatly - and I mentioned it during the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy 's debate - is the use by some nuclear utilities of contract workers for the more dangerous aspects of decommissioning and accident work . #% This proposal for a single work permit for nationals of non-EU countries was a missed opportunity to support decent working conditions where migrants are welcomed on the basis of equal treatment . #% In Yugoslavia , Slobodan Milosevic still remains in situ in former Yugoslavia and he has much to answer for . #% The mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria has proved extremely resilient to the various methods of dealing with it down the years . #% As ever with Marxist extremists , be they Castro or Sinn Fein , they simply pocket the concessions and carry on regardless . #% Was a recommendation an even-handed and proportionate response ? #% The key element of this White Paper is the setting up of the food authority , as we discussed today . #% I would ask that this be taken into consideration , because that has been the foundation of the rural model that the European Union put in place . #% First of all , on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , I should like formally to move the oral question , the subject of which is the EU strategic objectives for the 13th meeting of the CITES Convention . #% Let me pick out the points that we think are most important : infrastructure , legal certainty - people must know where they are - and the skills offensive , which ought , please , to be targeted not simply at our schoolchildren and students but at groups which have been neglected , such as women and older people , who represent an enormous source of skill if it were to be exploited . #% I am a great advocate of transmutation and partitioning and welcome any support that can be given to those technologies . #% We should be using the money properly - of course to increase infrastructure , to provide better services and to increase local employment as much as possible - but it should not be used merely as a substitute for private and other investments or for other initiatives to create local employment . #% We have made a very good start : we have seen many ministers visiting parliamentary committees and political groups already , and this has been much appreciated . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply , and even though he said it would take him longer to put all the measures together , I am still encouraged by his response . #% Let us get rid of protectionism , but protect consumers and working rights . #% 
We depend on democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law . #% Our Constitution is a finely crafted document , which enshrines the values and beliefs that have sustained the people of Ireland through the best and worst of times . #% The whole process of taking effective action against those who refuse to implement Community law needs to be speeded up urgently . #% Europe , in my view , must continue to invest in young people . #% However , we need to take a suitable light-touch approach to regulation in order to provide incentives that will encourage investment in funds based in the EU rather than continue to drive them offshore . #% Finally , as has been said by Mrs Ewing , Chernobyl is not a unique plant . #% It will do so in a measured , sensible and proportionate way that recognises certain critical uses for these gases , which , we must not forget , can be useful in certain circumstances for the very reason that they are excellent insulators . #% As my second point , I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recital A. Alas , this besotted committee feels it can not speak without showing cringing deference to the illfated Constitution , ever peddling the lie that it will deepen democracy , when in reality it is assetstripping every nation state of more democracy and more power . #% Second , our citizens ' attitudes to the euro reflects the economic situations in their own countries and their insecurity about their futures , pensions , jobs for their children and many other issues . #% The International Court of Justice and successive UN resolutions have made it clear that Western Sahara is Africa 's last colony , with a right to self-determination for its people . #% What struck me was that they all speak a common language , which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe . #% If we had had a referendum in Ireland on that , rather than on the Treaty of Nice , it would have received 100 % support . #% I would like to congratulate all my colleagues , particularly Mr Sturdy for initiating it , the Chairman Mrs Redondo Jiménez and the rapporteur Mr Kreissl-Dörfler . #% Basically , the tragedy in Bam was totally horrific , with tens of thousands of people dead and the infrastructure of this very historical city destroyed . #% I also wish to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on his very able handling of an extremely difficult brief and report . #% Last November they came and met the political leaders of the groups in this Parliament and held open consultations with them on the agenda that they proposed to put forward during their presidency . #% Nine countries , including Ireland , Germany and Portugal , refuse to sign the UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture . #% Mr President , the world was shocked by the massive undersea earthquake , which took place on 26 December 2004 . #% This success was not based on a dog-eat-dog approach , but on a social contract which ensured that working people would share in the wealth created , and their dependence on society generally would also benefit through the provision of universal public services . #% Malta has a lot to gain if it manages to align itself more closely with EU membership rules . #% At present the financing of anti-terrorist security measures for air transport differs from country to country and between transport models . #% I do not think there will be a justification , because arms embargoes are a good idea on all countries internationally . #% I have visited housing estates where grandmothers are rearing grandchildren because the parents have died , not from an overdose of cannabis or even of heroin , but because they used dirty needles to inject themselves with heroin or took impure heroin . #% We have allocated over EUR 1 billion for nuclear funding and nowhere near the equivalent for renewable energy . #% Despite the hard line of the Council , which is shared by the Commission - something I regret because it is not its constitutional position to do so - Parliament insists on its position . #% The global economic crisis , coupled with major shifts in world trade , has made many workers redundant in Ireland and across Europe . #% We chose life two years later in a referendum to protect the life of the human person from conception to natural death . #% If the political will exists , a ninth can be found and persuaded . #% We need Europe-wide action and the involvement not just of the police and politicians but also of the Football Association , clubs , and the fans themselves . #% Why then is Ireland gradually forging closer and closer links with an alliance committed to , and endowed with , a nuclear capability ? #% We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices . #% If this has been a difficult week for the European Commission , it has been a good week for European democracy . #% It says that we should encourage cooperation in the attainment of environmental objections and have particular regard to improving energy efficiency . #% Mr President , I would like to raise an issue about what happens to a non-national worker . #% There must be integration ; with my country in mind , consideration must be given to fisheries policy , regional development policy , rural development policy and Objective 1 areas . #% I would urge all Members to support this resolution . #% Spiralling costs of basic services such as gas and electricity , or outrageous mobile phone and roaming charges continue to hit Irish consumers hard . #% I am anxious that concrete steps be taken by the Commission to reduce the cost to business of complying with 25 different national regimes . #% I am not raising this subject with the intention of embarrassing the British Government in any way , but I am extremely concerned for European farmers , for the British farmers who are bearing the brunt of the crisis at the present time , and , in particular , I am concerned for farmers in Ireland . #% Might I ask you to look at the role of the parliamentary delegations in this particular area ? #% To return to the issue for farmers , their concern , in particular with the new single farm payment regime , is to receive prompt payment of what they now call the ` cheque in the post ' , to have it delivered on time and within their production year , because it comprises such a huge proportion of their farm income . #% Mr President , before I give my explanation of vote I would like to congratulate you on your handling of the vote on the Middle East resolution . #% Mr President , I commend the rapporteur , Mr Liese , for his conscientious work on this very sensitive and technical subject . #% We have heard that it is the biggest killer , that 5 million people die a year , 95 % of them in poor countries . #% It is important to bear in mind that economic integration and getting the economy of Europe right is important . #% The Taliban is harbouring Osama bin Laden , an international terrorist who has committed heinous acts of terror , not only this year , but in recent years too . #% Twice this week we have been in a situation where groups have made requests for a roll-call vote on the final vote of a report and , just before the final vote , the Chamber is told that the roll call has been withdrawn . #% Security is important in motherhood but financial security is not the whole story . #% I have had to engage a lawyer to follow up the fact that this has not been dealt with responsibly over the last couple of years . #% That is from a management which is now aware of its shortcomings , a management that foolishly engaged in staff reductions , now reversed thank goodness . #% This can only be carried out with the involvement of the international community and key non-governmental organisations . #% The EU and EU Member States should also provide more finance for the care of survivors of torture . #% They should not be allowed to hide behind the cover of the political movement they claim to support . #% This bickering about procedures , individual issues or political issues does us no credit as a Parliament . #% What better way to discharge the ministerial portfolio than to encourage their friends to stop this activity . #% The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families , communities and economies throughout the developing world . #% So far , we have only the vaguest outline of what that might represent . #% Madam President , I want to welcome the President-in-Office and to congratulate him on his enthusiastic and competent approach to the whole business of guiding the affairs of this Union over the next six months . #% Yes , we want informed choices from a health point of view -- everybody , not just employees , should be informed of the risks to over-exposure -- but please , say to President Barroso for all of us , that , if he is serious about Lisbon-proofing regulation and about less regulation being better regulation , then we do not need this nanny-type regulation and solar radiation must be removed from the directive . #% There is no one view within the Council so as the representative of the presidency , I can not speak on behalf of the Council . #% I take it that his is the correct one , that we are about selfsufficient since the Nordic countries joined . #% It is about channelling our precious resources for research into producing weapons that are going to cause conflict in other parts of the world . #% Nor do I believe we should bring in directives that are not implemented in the same way in each Member State . #% For example , I do not know what it is like in your country , but in my country , there is no such thing as a bank manager any more . #% Firstly , we must of course - and I think all Members in this Parliament agree - have the best possible environment for each of our citizens to allow them to have full freedom of health and safety . #% There must be a total transition to exclusively peaceful means . #% 
Ireland 's quality chocolate sector employs 3 , 000 people and uses 50 million gallons of milk and 40 tonnes of Irish sugar . #% 25 % of the EU 's and Ireland 's population experience at least one significant episode of mental ill health during their lives . #% The credibility of an EU observation mission 's final report will depend to a significant degree on the perceived and actual independence of its work . #% SAVE II could be an example of how funding can be used in other EU programmes such as structural funds and funding for third countries . #% In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life . #% To get through that few questions is really quite an appalling reflection on the House and the system . #% Mr President , I strongly support Mr Stevenson and congratulate him on an excellent report . #% I refer to : Amendment No 11 , which seeks to give an exemption to broadcasting companies which no one else enjoys and which would reduce performers ' and artists ' rights in contravention of the WIPO Treaty ; and Amendment No 4 which , in the second part , introduces an unnecessary and unwarranted EU restriction of the freedom of national courts to decide how to deal with injunctions , in particular concerning piracy , and amendments on levies . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Swedish presidency on its success and also express my regret that the Irish referendum result overshadowed many of their achievements , particularly in the field of enlargement . #% The biggest engine of growth and employment in economic terms should be given extra support . #% But take the broad guidelines on fiscal and monetary policy : it is not only a question of style , but of substance . #% The current draft will not lead to an increase in nuclear safety in the EU or the accession countries , because all nuclear states in the EU and the accession countries are already parties to the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Nuclear Safety Convention and must already report on the safety of nuclear power stations . #% Mr President , I am pleased to participate in this important debate on the enlargement of the European Union and in particular to acknowledge progress on Malta 's application for membership . #% Member States are adding too many cumbersome requirements to European directives , thus making it difficult for insurance companies to operate in other Member States . #% I would like to go on record as saying that this , in my view , is the first serious attempt in a long time to take up the challenge of the need for change . #% I am advocating a dual system in which the road tax increases with engine size and , within each engine size category , by energy efficiency . #% In the meantime , I have not altered my view other than to say , regretfully , that the dreaded virus has since spread to my country with devastating consequences for farmers within the control zone of Cooley Peninsula , and with worrying implications for Ireland 's farming and rural communities . #% But the Community is a big place and Ireland is an island and far away from its main markets . #% We need to agree on how to plan for the future and making sure the results of such an exercise are accessible . #% It would not be possible to catch and inject thousands of pigs every day for perhaps a week . #% I support the extension of the existing directive on carcinogens to include dust from oak and beech wood , category 1 and category 2 mutagens and vinyl chloride monomer . #% It is particularly relevant for Parliament to give its opinion on the future development of these policy areas given that under the British presidency the informal meeting of Ministers in Glasgow chose to devote one whole day to discuss both urban policy and the European spatial planning perspective . #% I believe our farmers - and , if I may say so , particularly Irish farmers - have no difficulty in producing a product of the highest quality and safety . #% Secondly , Europol , by its very nature , is reactive rather than interactive or proactive . #% I would like to appeal to all groups in this House to lend their support to the package of amendments now proposed and let us from Thursday onward ensure that we transcend partisanship , if some perceive it to have existed . #% Will it be a general clause for comitology , or a more specific rule which allows comitology only within a set of fixed aims , as it would appear the rapporteur prefers ? #% The major issue facing democratic leaders is how to respond to this latest atrocity . #% But by making unemployment on its own a criterion , it may well open up other areas for funding which may not achieve the objective which the Member would necessarily want to achieve in certain regions . #% The Commission services , and ultimately the College of Commissioners , have submitted to Parliament a proposal which , we believe , reflects too many of the priorities of the lobbyists with which they have dealt and too little concern for the wider public interest . #% I ask you to look at that issue , particularly as broadband means the Internet is on all the time . #% Final agreement on reform of the CAP should be preceded by a lengthy and comprehensive debate spread over a number of presidencies . #% You can not be unaware of its significance to some people here tonight . #% We had a previous report in Parliament by Mr Hyland , an Irish Member . #% I was very disappointed when President Bush earlier this year stated that he wanted to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord . #% However , the European Union must be sensitive to the needs of individual Member States when it comes to foreign policy matters . #% Unless the finances are provided , that Pact will , regrettably , still be left hanging . #% Of course , the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace , but , regrettably , a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process . #% That would offend and it would defy the settled political will of Northern Ireland 's people . #% Specifically , I will concentrate my remarks on two things . #% For example a United Nations peacekeeping force in the 1960s in the Belgian Congo ( now Zaire ) oversaw what may have been an uneasy peace but , nonetheless , a vital one . #% I reject , therefore , the views of those today who argue that this debate is a late attempt to derail the abolition of duty-free . #% A policy of strategic ring-vaccination around outbreaks may be appropriate in certain circumstances even though we still can not distinguish commercially between infected and vaccinated animals . #% It was never going to be easy to satisfy all of the interested parties who have lobbied and worked closely with the Union institutions to bring about amendments to the 1993 directive . #% I and members of my core team also briefed heads of mission in Islamabad on a weekly basis . #% To their credit , some Members , especially Dutch Members , only take the reimbursement of the tickets . #% As well as deeper knowledge , we need wider knowledge . #% I am totally opposed to a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office with its powers extending over the territory of all the Member States . #% My group leader , Mr Schulz , has launched a five-point European agenda which seeks to kick-start the process of re-establishing the self-confidence of Europeans . #% This report also helps French fishermen . #% I also welcome the recent decision of the Committee on the Environment to restate that this draft directive should be strengthened into a framework directive out of which further , more detailed and specific legislation can follow , in other words , daughter directives . #% I would like this House to reject what I consider to be a disgraceful resolution by the GUE/NGL Group . #% But there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission . #% Nothing has been done although there was an instant reaction from the Commission when the fact that 12 million people are under threat of famine in Ethiopia came to public attention . #% There is no convincing or compelling reason for these further burdens to be placed on this important sector of our economic production . #% Commissioner , will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal ? #% That is not what his report was meant to be about and he has misused his available time on something that is inappropriate . #% Having said that , I believe very strongly that we need to harmonise legal procedures so that we can offer a safe haven to those many people seeking refuge in the Community and also so as to have a humane and caring reception procedure that is uniform throughout the Community . #% I do not think that taking these steps which have been proposed in relation to TACIS would necessarily have the effect the honourable Member suggested . #% If we look at the history we see very rapid action following the oil shock in 1973 . #% The Constitution was drafted in a uniquely democratic process and putting in place a Constitution for Europe by way of a binding treaty between sovereign states is the most important European decision citizens will make . #% There is , of course , a fundamental contradiction in right-wing groups in this European Parliament claiming to stand for freedom and human rights in Pakistan , while supporting the war in Afghanistan which is having a severe spill-over effect into Pakistan with very detrimental consequences . #% Too often we hear spokesmen from the various political groups talking purely about the idea of a competitive economy and ignoring the balance we need to ensure within the European Union in terms of modernising and deepening the social model that we have in Europe . #% I have to say that today was a victory for Laeken , for the Commission and Council on the telecoms package , but it was not a victory for democracy in this House . #% The scarce development resources must be used in the most effective and efficient manner . #% Not only that , but he has reduced what was once one of the strongest economies in Africa to the depths of despair . #% Last week a family with five special needs children had their children taken from them . #% 
It has , thanks to the efforts of the Commission and Parliament , been better publicized in Northern Ireland . #% The microfinance facility is another piece in the jigsaw where the EU , in this case , is trying to ensure access to micro-credit for those who would not be able to access that credit from what we might define as the normal or usual financial institutions . #% I urge you to reject the funding suggested in the Caudron report . #% The Palestinian side has also been unable to fulfil many of its commitments on the issue of future security . #% Mr President , I welcome this debate because , following the reform of the CAP , farmers need to look at alternative methods of increasing farm incomes . #% Parliament has adopted amendments which define nuclear technology as unsustainable , and here we all need to clarify what we mean with regard to sustainability and the nuclear issue . #% Unfortunately , the debate on Europe which has been under way in the British media has been characterized by an absence of calm and rational comment . #% This resolution would call for a moratorium on new deep sea drilling until the standards have been improved and met . #% The fact of the matter is that the only international instrument which is designed to prevent and punish currency counterfeiting is the Geneva Convention of 1929 . #% There has been too much focus on agriculture , which you have said yourself , Commissioner . #% What is being promoted here is a phoney and empty contrivance , designed to bring statehood to Europe . #% The EU must take the lead in the UN and must pursue these goals through EU development cooperation . #% We must not interfere with the rights of individuals to a fair defence , trial , or prejudice the doctrine of presumed innocence . #% A savage murder was ordered outside a pub in Belfast less than four months ago , carried out by psychopaths , witnessed by 70 to 80 people . #% But yes , the organic sector is growing . #% I am pleased that the Commission has been most cooperative with the temporary committee throughout the period of its work . #% I therefore support the call on Iran to recommence the EU-Iran Human Rights Dialogue with the European Union and calls upon the Council and Commission to monitor developments in Iran and raise concrete cases of human rights abuses within the framework of the dialogue . #% The elections which have recently been held in a number of Member States should ensure this is the case . #% We are giving money to banks , but banks do not assess people on their track record , on their character and on the knowledge of their business . #% Mr President , I find it interesting that Mr Killilea quotes scientific evidence . #% Finally , I support the inclusion of pension liabilities within the SGP . #% Many of these people who are suspects do not have the right to proper interpretation or translation and , therefore , these people can not be guaranteed the right to a fair trial , or the right to be assumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any doubt . #% I have no objection when we are talking about hazardous waste , because that always has to be controlled . #% This seems to be a version of ` honour amongst thieves ' in that it is the countries involved in the arms industry which will make the decisions , and countries which have an ethical position as regards arms exports will have no say . #% At this time the blockade is spreading and nothing seems to be being done by either the British Government or the Commission . #% Just to confirm , President , that it is on the agenda this week and we will no doubt communicate directly with Mrs Gebhardt . #% We support democratic change in Yugoslavia and the European Union has rightly started to implement pilot projects based on the energy-for-democracy initiative . #% For instance , the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources . #% This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong . #% However , the Doha Round can not simply be about what the EU is willing to concede on agriculture . #% The Lange report this evening on the control of emissions of gases and other pollutants produced by vehicles continues the progress we have been making . #% You will not achieve market reform with those bulldozer tactics . #% This agreement is groundbreaking in terms of regulation which will clearly benefit consumers and our environment through tighter safety controls . #% The criteria to be agreed must therefore be adaptable and flexible . #% I am most concerned about the issue of sanctions ; it is regrettable that they are not included . #% These immigrants are under-paid ; they are often housed in disgraceful conditions . #% That can only be achieved if we invest in the people themselves . #% I welcome the availability of rapid diagnostic testing for improved detection of TSEs in cattle and believe , Commissioner , that further consideration should be given to its use as a means of establishing the health status of animals in Member States . #% The report states that the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects provides a good basis for greater protection of the environment , especially by promoting energy efficiency , but the wording is meaningless . #% I would like a clear answer from the Commission as to why it is failing to do what this Parliament has asked it to do and what it was instructed to do by the Council at the spring summit , because this is not acceptable . #% We do not yet know the implications of this decision , which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme . #% This is a practical demonstration of how Europe can be brought closer to its citizens by involving citizens in the planning and implementation of the programmes , although I agree with Mrs Kallenbach that this must be real , rather than apparent . #% Indeed , in Ireland recently we have created 130 , 000 jobs by our participation in the European activity . #% I would like to deal briefly with a number of issues that I think we should be addressing in Europe , before returning to the issue of the period of reflection on the Constitution . #% However , it will symbolise little more than a statement of platitudes and empty rhetoric unless its Statute comes into force . #% In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining . #% Our achievements in the EU are relevant elsewhere , and we should defend them - your task Commissioner . #% Gathering such information may seem difficult , but in reality a great deal of information is already in place : insurance companies have detailed data on accidents ; police have data on violent and self-inflicted harm . #% From 2007 on , 1200 Irish salmon fishermen face the loss of their livelihood due to such legislative and policy changes . #% They then discovered some years ago that , in fact , they have no protection whatsoever . #% We must use our influence how and when we can . #% It requires the good will and the support of many from both the smaller and larger Member States within the European Union . #% The Commission and successive Presidencies , including the United Kingdom Presidency , have stepped up their efforts to achieve better regulation by improving the quality of EU laws and transposition and implementation . #% We should not ignore the fact that the current attempt to undermine the International Criminal Court has implications far wider than simply excluding American forces engaged in international conflicts . #% Our government has applied over and over again for ever-increasing amounts of structural and cohesion funds without feeling that the EU has any right to scrutinize how the money is spent . #% Even though many of us have criticised Serbia for its actions in the past , and maybe for some intransigence at the present time , it has legitimate concerns which must be responded to . #% In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment ; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are , to get them , and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that . #% However , in my contribution I want to draw attention to one point I feel has not been adequately dealt with . #% The facts speak for themselves in this regard : over half a million people die in the Union as a direct consequence of smoking each year . #% We can create thousands of much needed jobs and we can allow gas and electricity suppliers to make their money in a more sensible way by selling the services which energy gives us - warm homes , cool fridges and machines which work - rather than selling increasingly large amounts of gas and electricity . #% The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process . #% Madam President , the debate is very much centred on the notion of Europe being a continent . #% in writing . - I wish to record that I support this report on Extension of the EC-USA agreement for scientific and technological cooperation . #% The use of maximum sustainable yield or any of a number of other reference points is quite simply wrong , for they lead to over-fishing and stock collapse . #% Apparently , 26 % of rapid alerts in 2002 were caused by fish . #% However , this should be seen as one step in the process , not the end of the process , because we must move on to an Intergovernmental Conference , we must get the approval of the 25 governments and there will be changes within that process . #% 
We will work together to enhance the frequency and level of contact between the Canadian International Development Agency and EU agencies responsible for development assistance in order to bring forward common approaches . #% Many of the proposals in Mr Mann 's report and some of the amendments will help towards this final goal . #% It has become too large and divided . #% I am not saying that that feeling is widespread , but it is spreading , and I think that is why our words here have to be translated into action . #% We must give consumers the choice . #% However , I do not want this directive to be used as an excuse for credit providers to opt out of the very high consumer protection that is already offered in other Member States . #% The Council should at least answer that part of the question . #% I should like to relate an anecdote . #% I realise that this execution is not the wish of the Nigerian Government . #% If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation , it is incredible to put it up as an example . #% Most importantly , the directive should propose mechanisms for the internalisation of external costs of traditional energy production . #% However , it is important to note the dangers involved in ` soft law ' approaches to labour standards . #% Mrs Stauner is new to the Budget Control Committee , but her statement is a real reflection of the mood and the debate that went on . #% We had group meetings at the time and saw on the screen `` Question 41 '' . #% Mr President , I do not agree with your interpretation of how we take the vote on the structural fund programme , because the general regulation is actually the regulation governing every other aspect of the implementing regulations . #% His call for the EU to devote 10 % of our development aid to tackling this problem , his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS , and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area . #% Recent developments in the United States are alarming indeed , but we can not allow experimentation with , or a market in , human life . #% When someone touches that symbol , they touch us all deeply , because it is part of our common , human , democratic bond and inheritance . #% I would particularly like to put a supplementary to the Council representative on the issue of the temporary agency workers directive . #% Ireland , for example , adopted the ` Equal Status Act ' in 2000 , and our legislation outlaws direct and indirect discrimination , including discrimination on grounds of gender , marital status and family status . #% The fact is that if the ten applicant countries proposed by the Commission - for whose efforts I am grateful and I thank Commissioners Prodi and Verheugen in particular - are to be part of the enlarged Europe which Mr Cohn-Bendit is dreaming of , then please tell the people of my country , on behalf of the Green Party of Europe , that they should vote ` yes ' to the Treaty of Nice . #% They are being damaged for life . #% First of all , the PPE-DE Group will be having a free vote on paragraph 3 , as requested . #% It is incumbent on us to send out a clear message that we would expect every government in the European Union to comply fully with the nine years . #% This is not just about the death of the journalist , horrific as that is ; it is not just about Chechnya ; it is also about Russian treatment of Georgia in the recent past and what they have done . #% You mentioned in your speech that you do not see the issue as a clash of civilisations . #% This killing was ruthlessly supervised and forensically covered up by men announcing that their activities were IRA business , by men who proceeded to intimidate the 70 witnesses to the crime and their families , first forbidding them from calling an ambulance on the night in question , as Robert McCartney bled to death before their eyes and his colleague lay seriously injured . #% Also the issue of costs for education and training should be factored in , because obviously this is a cost , or should be a cost , in most cases to employers . #% I genuinely believe that the Commission proposals in this area would be disastrous if implemented . #% As the record will show , I have answered those questions unequivocally and properly . #% There is no doubt that all the evidence of history indicates that we have to regulate the funding of political parties . #% I am afraid I do not accept the logic of this wholly . #% Alongside this , the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus . #% The Greek Government sought to put in place in Europe a common political position on Iraq . #% I am also pleased to say that the summit in Dublin was one of the more successful summit meetings in recent years . #% I have a great love of the Jewish people . #% Mr President , Parliament maintains a network of information offices in the national capitals of each of the Member States . #% Within each Member State , effective ` unbundling ' of network and supply activities in gas and electricity must be made a reality : in Ireland this has yet to happen . #% Secondly , biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80 % fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels . #% Therefore , there is a degree of urgency from the perspective of the tobacco manufacturers to lure and corner the teenage market with innovative and inviting forms of advertising relating to various cigarette products . #% In conclusion , the whole question of financing the enlargement of the Union must not be confined to a narrow accounting exercise but must also take account of less tangible but no less important factors , such as security issues and likely shifts in trade patterns . #% In my own report I have said that the European Union must put in place a rigorous monitoring system of Community carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions at the earliest opportunity . #% I am delighted to say that we have reached a good compromise on the timetable of this recommendation . #% Clarity in the budget line , so that we can measure here in Parliament that you are meeting those commitments , and additionality are absolutely central to this . #% I do not snigger at any such comments . #% This programme would include strategies for intensifying research into the causes of the disease , for identification of risk factors , for prevention and treatment and for encouraging specific training of health and geriatric care staff . #% It is important that there is a balance between animal welfare and the need for consumer protection . #% in writing . - I welcome the adoption of this report in my capacity as the Chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland . #% Many farmers may not survive to benefit from the long-term measures of the proposed reform which is the subject of Agenda 2000 and this debate . #% It accepts modulation while differentiating between advantaged and disadvantaged regions and , therefore , will give better compensation for poorer regions - and this is welcome . #% They refuse to admit that they subsidise their agriculture in a much less transparent way than we do . #% We are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price . #% My concern is that the Single European Act , which both countries have ratified , obliged all members who ratified it to eliminate all borders by 1 January 1992 . #% This directive must ensure genuine universal access and extend to all users , especially those with special social needs , those on low incomes and those with disabilities . #% Thank you , as Enda Kenny said recently in the Dáil , to the Permanent Representation and all the civil servants behind the scenes who made this technically a very good presidency . #% It is extremely disappointing to learn of the latest difficulty that has arisen in the negotiations between the European Union and South Africa . #% This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House . #% Madam President , I believe , as the other speakers have said , that this is a significant formal occasion today , because we have for the first time in plenary the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy . #% There is no doubt that consumers are tremendously concerned and I think we have to be able to allay that concern so that consumers can feel confident that the food they buy , anywhere in the European Union , will be fully traceable and good for whoever purchases it . #% We must not only appreciate and preserve local specialities but also the farmers ' markets at which they are still sometimes locally sold . #% Over the years , Irish farmers have taken great pride in high quality food produced naturally . #% The most crowded airspace in Europe is over South-East England where , this year alone , air traffic controllers are filing a record number of overload reports . #% The draft Treaty by Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention lays the groundwork for the enactment of the new European Union Treaty . #% The Mauritius agreement is very similar to the one with Madagascar , Mauritius being a neighbouring island . #% I , too , would urge the Council to reconsider its attitude to this office . #% Given the recent comments by Lotte Leicht in the European Voice that the EU has been weak in implementing human rights and democracy clauses , the lack of response is appalling . #% 
I am pleased that you have done so so far , and we look forward to your next communications on energy efficiency . #% We do , and it is the Stability and Growth Pact . #% The pressures on young women today in my country , for all its economic success , are such that they can not afford a second child . #% The necessary police and judicial cooperation must be forthcoming at European level , and urgently so . #% But perhaps he was the victim of a few too many glasses of zero-taxed wine himself ! #% Nevertheless , I agree with Mrs Fraga on the whole matter of whether or not it is right to charge the fishermen for the privilege of fishing . #% Many animal welfare groups that are very concerned about this have contacted me . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mr Collins on his excellent report and indeed for accepting my amendments on the health aspects of air travel . #% It is for this reason that I support the payment services report by Mr Gauzès . #% Yes , we debate it here , but realistically we can change nothing . #% in writing . - We should remember that 54 % of farmed land in the EU currently falls into a LFA classification . #% We were the first committee to commission our own impact assessment , under Mr Whitehead 's chairmanship , for amendments on the Toubon report on nominal quantities for pre-packed products . #% The URBAN initiative will allow for projects to be undertaken in these areas to tackle the ingrained problems of long-term unemployment and urban decay . #% It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007 . #% The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions . #% I know that my own country has yet to appoint a woman Commissioner , and I hope that when it appoints a new Commissioner , the government will take this into account and appoint a woman Commissioner . #% Mr President , the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999 has certainly ensured that greater attention is given to the implementation of a common employment policy . #% Thanks to the pragmatism of our rapporteur , Bert Doorn , and good cooperation with the Commission and Presidency , we now have a flexible EU instrument that will raise the quality and consistency of audits across Europe while also respecting the good domestic company law provisions already in place . #% We have a democracy in Ireland , a funny type of democracy : it decides who will be elected and who will not . #% I fully support this programme and commend this report . #% Too often we have seen hidden barriers put in place to prevent people from one profession or another moving to a country to operate . #% The real threat to implementation comes from the Member States themselves . #% This directive will force consumers to purchase these products on the Internet , where there are no controls . #% Since 1994 significant increased emissions have been documented from THORP , and this can not possibly be compatible with the commitment to reduce emissions to zero . #% Madam President , listening to a number of speakers here today , one of the most effective measures that the EU has is to impose fines on Member States for not honouring their obligations under EU law . #% The need to help farmers affected by the BSE crisis has once again demonstrated the importance of maintaining the CAP budget at a level which can fund the ongoing farm programmes while at the same time responding to emergency situations such as the beef crisis and the recovery of consumer confidence in healthy beef and opening up all the internal European markets for disease-free beef from other European Union Member States . #% The European Union needs to address this issue . #% Not only do SMEs provide valuable employment , accounting for 80 % of new jobs in the EU in recent years , but they also play a key social role in stimulating local economies , diversifying employment and encouraging entrepreneurship . #% Last week a report by Mental Disability Rights International caused huge concern and outrage because it outlined serious abuses in Romanian institutions . #% Mr President-in-Office , we have heard your remarks on the EU-US agenda , and , as a member of this Parliament 's US Delegation , I can tell you that we have just returned from Washington , where we had meetings with members of the Congress , and a lot of our discussions obviously focused on the Helms-Burton legislation - legislation that is very damaging to our European interests . #% I very much welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has written to the Israeli Foreign Minister expressing our deepest concern at the damage that has been done to projects funded by the European Union as a direct result of Israeli attacks against the Palestinian institutions . #% We wish him a fair wind only as regards that particular issue . #% The officials acted or did not act as a result of the direct instructions of the commissioners responsible at that time and the then Council . #% In actual fact , what we are doing is to encourage them to go even faster , and we have no young farmers coming into the industry . #% One hundred and twenty years ago there were 1.6 billion people in the world . #% It provides an incentive to service providers to establish themselves in low-wage , low-tax countries , and encourages a race to the bottom in relation to wages and employment conditions . #% In Ireland now , we are looking forward to not slaughtering cohorts when we discover a BSE case in a herd on farms , but many farms have suffered as a result of our more stringent policy in this regard . #% I would like a more consistent and caring attitude from the Commission to the future of the family farm sector . #% I support this as a policy objective because one of the criticisms of European legislation in general is that it is just not implemented in time . #% As an aside , I venture to suggest that this is the secret ambition of some of the supporters of early enlargement . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs want to see improvements in the Single Market and to facilitate cross-border transactions for consumers and small businesses . #% Second , much emphasis is being placed upon the lack of ability on the part of Europe to deliver on things like the Lisbon Agenda and creating more jobs . #% Judgement on the action of the Commission must be based on the circumstances at any given time . #% For the past fifty years , RDAs have formed the basis of conventional nutritional wisdom . #% I am astonished at some of the opposition to the idea of binding legislation because it is essential to secure adequate funding for integrated coastal zone management initiatives across Europe . #% This is primarily the case because the dynamics within the European institutions are going to change . #% Mr President , I think Members should realise what an excellent negotiator we had in Pascal Lamy . #% It seems incredible but it is true , that in Ireland , where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country , farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition . #% Productivity-enhancing policies , particularly those in green energy and research and development , must be recognised as the driver of the EU 's economic future . #% I am entitled to that . #% If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately . #% Labour MEPs are voting for this report as it backs the reform process , but we do not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel . #% Will the Commissioner pledge that he will not seek to allow a system to be put in place that will bestow a second-class service on rural communities ? #% Central to any future reform must be income stability for farmers . #% Our membership of the European Union appears to have brought out in people a cultural and heritage need to promote and foster the language . #% The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done . #% In the USA , and increasingly in Japan , patents have unfortunately been granted for what is essentially pure software . #% As the Lisbon Treaty clearly states , the European Union has to take account of development cooperation objectives when implementing policies that might impact developing countries . #% Mr President , in my first remarks in the House I wish to state that the great sense of honour that I feel derives not from membership of this institution , but from the confidence in me manifested by the people of Northern Ireland in making me their first choice in terms of representation in this Parliament . #% We need to reiterate that debt of gratitude . #% Paragraph A continues to confuse the principle of additionality with the separate but equally important principle of co-financing . #% I believe that we should proceed on the basis that we will use the Euro from the day that the currency rates are fixed . #% This is why I retabled the relevant amendment from first reading , which we overwhelmingly adopted first time round . #% That is how we need to do our business , to put a drive , a focus and an energy behind it . #% People are focusing on the wrong aspect . #% 30 years ago the world was very different . #% 
You have more to do . , which means ` thank you ' . #% Nobody in Parliament today has condoned or justified the terrible act , but all have called for justice . #% With regard to sustainability , the rising price of oil and fuel in recent months has sent shockwaves through each and every economy , as well as shocking private consumers . #% Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased . #% It is an attack on the CAP and is effectively a move to renationalise agriculture policy . #% Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard . #% I would now ask the Council to consider such cases in its delegations of justice ministers in Dublin at the end of this month . #% The Lamy strategy would save lives , and pharmaceutical companies will not be losing revenue because the people in these countries are too poor to buy the medication as it stands . #% As a people we need to develop a recycling mentality , which is now commonplace in all the European Union Member States . #% Mr President , I thank the Commission for raising this important issue for animals and humans . #% Otherwise , we find out the bad news when it is too late . #% I want to put on record that none of us dare forget that Saddam has proved by the murderous slaughter of his own people that he would use mass destruction weapons if he had the chance . #% This charter of passenger rights currently exists in European Union airports but many passengers are not fully aware of its existence or do not fully understand its provisions . #% Young men looking for their first job , if that job involves driving a car in Ireland , have to pay something like ECU 50 for insurance per week . #% Mr President , I have recently returned from Sri Lanka , where I was continuing my engagement with the peace process at the invitation of those involved . #% Let me take as one example the preparatory action for security research , of enormous interest to the citizens of Europe . #% Many of the letters I receive in Dublin are from members of religious orders , for example . #% Technically the identification of a specific day is not connected with health and safety at work . #% Socio-economic research which tells us how our society is growing and what we could do to make it better is essential . #% Regardless of what position individual Members of this House have on the worth of the continuation of duty-free , my group strongly supports this motion as it addresses the failure of the democratic process whereby the Commission continues to ignore the wishes of those who are elected by the citizens of Europe . #% There is no point in setting a deadline that can not be achieved and triggering the inevitable infringement procedures . #% Our powers in this regard are limited but this does not mean that we can not speak on these matters and try and make improvements . #% I find it unacceptable that out of 14 speakers , 11 were on the speakers ' list . #% Mr President , I rise to speak on the subject of the Middle East so that I can dissociate myself from the motion for a resolution tabled by my group and the voting stance it adopted on the issue . #% There can be no successful dialogue with criminal terrorism for it is a lie incarnate . #% Commissioner Busquin ' s communication on the European research area is very good . #% I particularly commend the rapporteur for encouraging the authorities in BiH to pursue wanted war crimes perpetrators and bring them to justice . #% What is going to be the outcome of that ? #% Because the balance of payments constraint and problems will cease to exist . #% I can not emphasise strongly enough that this is unacceptable behaviour and that the relevant Commissioner is well aware of our views . #% The many thousands of workers who marched in the streets of Brussels recently - airport workers , industrial workers , generally from the duty-free industry - should not have to beg for their jobs . #% Canada has shown that it can actually wipe out its stocks without any help from anyone else . #% A strong competitive and stable economy is essential in order to deliver sustainable growth and a better quality of life to the citizens of Europe . #% The Commission has confirmed that this will not happen . #% All the sacrifices they made were argued about before , but now all those sacrifices were in vain , because the Commission now takes a different line and says the box has got to go . #% Many of the wells had to be closed . #% It should not be an indirect subsidy paid because , in cases of over-production of milk , fines are paid by the Member State rather than by the individuals who over-produced ; this amounts to indirect subsidisation . #% As to your answer , I disagree with its contents . #% I can assure the House that the concerns which Mr Smith raises here - and I appreciate his comments and may I say go raibh mile maith agat - are issues which are regularly raised when meetings of this kind take place . #% in writing . - I welcome this report and the Commission 's intention to review the European standardisation system ; I hope they pave the way to a modern , integrated standardisation policy . #% Mr President , the resolution of the World Conference against Racism held in Durban is not exactly what many would have hoped for . #% Countries in Eastern and Central Europe are presently receiving EU Structural Funds so as to make their economies more competitive . #% If you were sitting a public examination in Ireland , you might be asked to compare and contrast . #% It is fair to say that the United States is possibly three years ahead of the Union as regards the use of the Internet . #% Investment in a clean environment in my country will in the medium to long term justify any additional expenditure incurred and the European Union will support any innovative measures in this regard . #% But there is also a realisation that further substantial political reforms are going to have to take place in Turkey before final accession negotiations can conclude . #% Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 102 ( 2 ) . #% I agree with Gilad 's father , who has asked that his son 's case be addressed as a humanitarian issue and not be turned into a political football . #% He contrasts the position in the United States and the European Union in terms of jobs , spin-offs and the development of a scientific culture . #% But before his statement could be taken for what it was worth , it was totally undermined by the Council . #% She has begun to take action and I appreciate that very much . #% I have had a long-held opposition to the establishment of this office , which has been raised , not only in this context , but also on the question of cross-border criminal proceedings . #% For my group that would be a serious and significant priority . #% Mr Oostlander 's report is a small but very important step in that direction . #% It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time . #% Too much attention has been given to the monetary aspect of EMU and not enough to the economic provisions . #% I ask you to do whatever you can , in your last days in office , to ensure that this issue is given a higher priority in the progress towards accession . #% It aims to rationalise , strengthen and update the legislation governing the importation into the Community of wild and domestic animals susceptible to either FMD or CSF . #% If the House could agree we could overcome all the difficulties that we have with the language versions by putting in as a separate paragraph itself - either as a sub-paragraph of 45 or as a new 45 ( a ) - which says `` and urges them not to imprison young people who commit offences , except as a last resort '' . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Juncker and his dedicated political colleagues in his excellent diplomatic and civil service on the job they have done over the last six months . #% The interim report is not a perfect one , but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting . #% Is it not clear that the EU undermines its credibility as regards taking a stand on international terrorism if it acquiesces in Member States harbouring wanted and convicted international terrorists ? #% As I have said on many previous occasions in this House , farmers are unfortunately the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control . #% Two wrongs do not make a right . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the very comprehensive reply which he has given . #% It is extremely important that Member States allow their citizens to have as great as possible a role in decision-making and that national parliaments should have the right to scrutinise all the EU institutions . #% 
I am wondering whether this is entirely necessary , because all we are looking for there is for aid to the government to be suspended , not aid to NGOs , for humanitarian reasons . #% We have a duty of care to farmers in the developing world which we can and will discharge in the context of a level world playing field but , as European legislators , our primary duty of care is to our own farmers and to a sustainable future for agriculture in the EU , the largest agricultural producer and the largest economy in the world . #% Residue testing , pre mortem , through urine and blood samples , and post mortem , through kidney and meat sampling , must be carried out by the competent veterinary authorities to ensure maximum food safety . #% We should not accept that . #% I would like to agree with what the rapporteur says : the consumer must be looked after , and that means competition . #% The events that led to Robert McCartney 's murder show clearly the collusion that occurred . #% In relation to the PNR issue , it is extremely important that citizens have the right to data protection . #% I am convinced that the Ryanair dispute in Ireland would have been solved long ago if this directive had been in place . #% One of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor . #% Please keep reporting to Parliament . #% Constructive engagement was exactly the policy which Ronald Reagan pursued in South Africa . #% I apologise , as I did not intend to be discourteous to the House . #% The leaders of the 15 countries presently comprising membership of the EU believe that there will have to be substantial changes to the internal decision-making processes within the EU if the enlargement process is to take place in a structured and streamlined fashion . #% Finally , the same situation applies in all of the peripheral countries and regions of the Union and it is vitally important for the success of both the euro and the single market that the good work of recent years should be consolidated through the continued availability of structural cohesion resources until these regions have reached European average levels . #% Saving people 's lives must always come before any doctrine on intellectual property rights . #% This may not be music to the ears of the proponents of sweeping CAP reform but that is the reality of the conclusions of the Brussels Summit . #% Having struggled with the budget of the energy programmes over the last two years I was aware of that lack . #% Let us hope that they make these decisions in the same spirit of openness and accountability and respect for democracy that they rightly demand of the Commission . #% However , I oppose the creation of a common consolidated corporate tax as I believe the principle of subsidiarity should apply and decisions in relation to taxation should be retained at national level . #% It is a chemical usher that leeches these other poisons into the water and then transfers them to body tissue and bone . #% Little wonder the tide of Euro-scepticism continues to rise . #% I welcome the Irish Government 's talks this week with the new head of the American Environmental Protection Agency . #% The best way for us to present this to the people of Europe is to say that yes , we have hit a bump on the road , but this is not the end of the European project . #% There will be a ban on enforced sales , that is , the distant supply of unsolicited services . #% The European Union , as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam , has greater powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer rights . #% With most other Member States not taking their fair share of immigration under the 2004 enlargement , would countries like mine , the United Kingdom , not be wholly justified in refusing to extend their present open-door policy to Romania and Bulgaria ? #% Mr Söderman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year . #% I am grateful for that . #% I know that Members in my own group asked questions such as : will this person get this Commission post ? #% Let me assure you that , if the EU decided to ban live animal exports today , the Australians would step in and take over our markets straight away . #% The Commission 's proposal is a sensible one , particularly from an environmental perspective , since taxes levied on motorists would be linked to carbon dioxide emissions from the vehicle . #% Can we resolve that we will examine the situation of carers and that we will include them in our recommendations on work in future , and that we will no longer discriminate against this important workforce which is already discriminated in the area of pay . #% Elected representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should , at the very least , accept that their own privileges undergo the same treatment . #% First of all , I welcome Mr van Velzen 's emphasis on life sciences other than genomics and his advocacy of translational research , which means rapid transposition into clinical applications . #% After considered deliberation , I have come to the firm conclusion that the only logical and legally watertight option in the spirit of the aims and scopes of the regulation -- I would advise colleagues and others interested to read the recitals -- is to opt for a single legal base that corresponds to the preponderant purpose or the ` centre of gravity ' of the legislation . #% In supporting the report before Parliament , it is to the credit , I believe , of the Commission that regulations were quickly put in place to address both the eradication of BSE and , more importantly , measures to prevent a recurrence . #% Mr Bouwman mentioned that middle-aged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , it is absolutely crucial that the G20 employment and labour ministers put quality jobs at the heart of their economic recovery plans . #% Most importantly and in conclusion , we must be ensured guaranteed compensation for any reduction in market support . #% At that time the idea of the spy-in-the-sky was an emotive issue . #% It is not just about trading blocs . #% It is a disgrace that a country of the European Union is led by a man who can present these ideas in this day and age , particularly when the country is Italy , which in my view has always led in terms of modern ideas . #% I understand the difficulties that creates . #% It is my view that citizenship derives in the first instance from a sense of responsibility which comes from within a moral framework - I am not talking specifically about a religious framework , but a moral framework of how one sees the world and one 's place in the world . #% The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty . #% It is obvious to everyone now that many mistakes were made in the past . #% Would you not accept that we need an adequate response mechanism and that the only way to address the problem would be to establish an EU coastguard ? #% It is with regret that colleagues on the right differed . #% Far from a bargain . #% Today when we speak about Chernobyl and the nuclear industry , the two go hand in hand . #% I hope we will hear more about this shortly from the Commission . #% She will probably tell you that the shape of our roads is inadequate . #% , in writing . - The ` European Cities Guide ' and similar outfits are fraudulent operations which specifically target SMEs . #% Mr President , the PROGRESS programme plays an important role in promoting employment and social solidarity and it is all the more important as , increasingly , the drive to put profits before people excludes and marginalises so many . #% The overall new policies that we are trying to work towards include a common energy system , where we recognise , of course , the rights of the Member States to deal with their own energy issues , but also see where those individual Member States can cooperate with each other to guarantee minimum resources as regards safety and security , with regard to interconnection and to guaranteeing the proper use of funding for research and development as regards new renewable energies and in particular on biofuels . #% in writing . - There is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory . #% I find that totally atrocious . #% It may be that we need extra time rather than applying the clause under Article 42 immediately . #% Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000 . #% One of the elements relating to energy efficiency is that if you turn off your television properly instead of leaving it on standby , you can save 25 % of the electricity that is normally used for a television . #% We have a report about to go before this House in Brussels . #% But in the least developed countries , such problems , for which they are not responsible , are compounded by the consequences of food and climate crises , with dramatic implications for a sixth of the world 's population who suffer from hunger . #% I would urge the Commission , too , to take this on board . #% Some regions in Ireland are clearly out-performing other regions in terms of economic performance and therefore all regions can not and must not be put into the same bracket for the next tranche of structural fund money . #% In the absence of Mrs Damião , he has done excellent work in reaching the compromises which we have before us here in this debate . #% If we want to talk about gender equality and demography , we need to talk about both genders being equally and fully responsible for rearing children . #% 
The cornerstone of food safety policy is the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority . #% In my own peripheral Objective 1 region , after a number of years of cohesion funding to my country , the Committee on Petitions of this Parliament recently acknowledged that Third World-standard unsafe water supply existed in communities such as Carraroe in my own constituency . #% However , we were subject to a 4-hour flight delay and were taken to Düsseldorf on route . #% The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed . #% The reason we wanted this was because in all the discussions we have had on EMU and the single currency , Member States and experts simply have not dealt with the regional issues . #% To oblige An Post to now apply VAT to its postal services could well be the death knell of the company . #% Even things like the Geneva Convention are being pushed aside in the interests of keeping people out of Europe . #% Moreover some of the proposals passed today concerning the definitions of intentional infringement and commercial scale threaten to remove the discretion of trained and qualified national judges to take the circumstances of each individual case into account . #% The biggest difficulty with the format of the form was that it was too bureaucratic and there was no certainty or guarantee that you would get the standard of care that you required -- or even get any care -- when you were struck by an illness or a certain medical condition while you were away . #% The Presidency of the European Parliament has to reflect the views of all its Members and I am more than satisfied that you , Mrs Fontaine , have worked exceptionally hard during your term of office to ensure that all our views were represented on the many occasions on which you had to fulfil this responsibility . #% Mr President , following Mr Farage 's comments , I note that this is the first time ever that UKIP will vote with the Communists ! #% That will not be known for certain until this matter is heard in a court of law . #% The last thing I want to say is that what has happened in Haiti is grounded in poverty , and , when this terrible tragedy eases and it goes off the screens , let us not forget Haiti . #% We can not ignore the widespread abuse of human rights in China , particularly with regard to a harmless but tiny minority -- namely practicing Christians . #% That such a thing should be true in this Parliament is an absolute disgrace . #% We welcome the fact that some redundant workers from big companies will have access to this fund , and call on the companies concerned to seriously negotiate with workers ' representatives and to not use the existence of the fund to back out of their social obligations . #% This entire saga needs to be properly and thoroughly investigated because , forgive the pun , as far as I can see , the whole thing is very fishy . #% However , it is entitled to take that stance ; it is entitled to put forward its own viewpoint and its own ideas ; it is entitled to make new agreements with third countries , if it so wishes . #% Therein lies the opportunity and the danger : the opportunity to engage citizens from all of the 25 countries in the European project , but equally the danger of failing to achieve that objective . #% We must ensure we take the necessary steps to ensure this industry achieves its full potential . #% We have to try and overcome the idea that there is one true faith , one true version of history and one version of truth expounded by the chosen ones . #% China has given undertakings in the Sino-British Declaration that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy , except for foreign and defence affairs . #% I asked if the Conservatives would call in to the Regional Committee now and again so that we could have this report on the agenda nine months ago . #% As regards the representatives of the Spanish presidency , it is right and proper that they are here today and I thank them for coming . #% They use public procurement , without blushing , to encourage their space sector . #% Mr President , as the last speaker said , the brutal killing of this human rights activist is unacceptable , and the fact that the government there seems totally unwilling to do anything to protect the lives of its citizens is appalling . #% At the moment the Israelis are insisting that their ban on contacts with those who meet Yasser Arafat also applies to people from within the European Union . #% Biotechnological research must continue and must be properly funded . #% I can assure you that we checked on that day that the comments we ascribe to the Commissioner were accurate . #% I congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent job he has done in a very difficult area . #% Annex 1 of the Directive lists the instruments in relation to which the public for the first time are be given the opportunity to participate in the drawing up of plans and programmes . #% I felt ashamed , Madam President , in this neighbourhood that refused to be marginalized , that right now there is nothing I can do . #% We have acted , but I believe that it is the citizens , in their determination , and animal welfare campaigners who should take the credit for this new law and for helping us to persuade you , Commissioner , to give us the legal power to ban it . #% The solution to this horrific 20-day bombing campaign will obviously involve negotiation . #% They were being encouraged to learn but were also being fed . #% Finally , it is clear to me that , due to wide divergence in national laws , the resolution of this type of case requires expensive , specialist , legal advice . #% I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kenyan authorities , and in particular President Moi , for any assistance they can provide to ensure a positive outcome . #% I am curious . #% It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations . #% The Palestinians have been unable to fulfil many of their commitments on the crucial issue of security . #% In a world of such bad news , it is good to hear such good news from time to time . #% This is , indeed , a very significant move on their part . #% This report makes it possible to apply the ` polluter pays ' principle , a principle which must be used with great consistency and efficiency . #% It has to be founded , if it is to be meaningful , on mutual respect rather than political posturing or gallery-playing which , unfortunately to date , have attended much of the political aspect of that process , especially in Northern Ireland . #% Nothing can excuse the widespread violence and intimidation of the last 10 days . #% The judgment that this House will make in relation to your work as President-in-Office will be based on how well you advance the European agenda . #% The fisheries agreement with Argentina subsidizes transfers to the Argentine flag . #% The Commission also seems to be stalling on the other important areas , such as minimum income . #% Equally importantly , there should be no ambivalence about this evil . #% Fishing communities which have seen their fleets cut must now be supported to be able to retain what is left and encouraged to break in with new developments . #% I invite it to do so again . #% The continuation of these peace initiatives is invaluable in rebuilding trust between communities and bringing communities together from both sides of the border . #% These credits are regularly used to back projects and trade that are destructive to the environment and workers ' rights . #% It should not just be a matter of having vaccines in case it affects our own citizens : if there is an outbreak , we should target it wherever it occurs and try to ensure that it does not spread . #% We need excise regimes that favour bio-fuels and bio-flexi-fuels . #% I therefore use this forum tonight to call on the UK Government to release sufficient funds to enable this essential work to be done , otherwise the implementation of the Nitrates Directive will be impossible . #% We are not going to find a way forward without sanctions , because we need both the carrot and stick approaches to ensure that the legislation is complied with . #% This had a dramatic impact on improving the available workforce to the growing industrial base and services base in Ireland . #% That reason is to depoliticise decision-making when it comes to the agricultural budget . #% I trust the Commission and the Council will see the merits of supporting this . #% For the time being , support for the 7000-strong AU force is essential and the UN has agreed to give logistical and material support . #% Mr President , I have a poster in front of me here which says no to war . #% With the adoption of this package , business and SMEs will find it easier , as Mr Stubb said , to sell their products - common household goods , bicycles , ladders , tanks , containers etc. - while consumers should reap the benefit of a wider choice of high-quality and safe products . #% The beef crisis has already diverted attention from important work under way in the Intergovernmental Conference . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to respond to the first speaker , who indicated that he had difficulties in respect of the exploitation of young seasonal workers in Northern Ireland , the constituency that I represent . #% Furthermore there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational historical and radioactive and other harmful substances , accidental and operational marine pollution . #% 
The Irish Ombudsman has described the scheme , as introduced by the Irish Government , as seriously deficient and grossly flawed . #% In all of these instances a cessation of conflict had generally been brokered by the UN itself and a form of peace had ensued . #% I warmly welcome the statement made by the President to us here this morning . #% I have taken a quick look at the gender breakdown of the three programmes targeted for assistance and they run 91 % , 72 % and 79 % male . #% I am deeply disappointed at some Member States and applicant countries who give military support to the conflict . #% It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament . #% The great value of this particular piece of legislation is that we hope that many countries that , due to their own judicial systems , were unwilling to sign the Hague Convention of 1980 on the transnational abduction of children , will see their way to signing this piece of legislation , thus ensuring the safe and quick return of children who have been abducted . #% Madam President , Ireland is a good example of the effective use of Structural Funds . #% Another example comes from the Pacific Ocean , where the regional body , the IATTC , has succeeded in dramatically reducing certain types of by-catch , namely dolphins . #% Mr President , I just wish to make two points . #% The EU must step in to fully cover the loss of this income while making it clear that we will recover that money from Israel by freezing all money due to Israel from the EU to the same value , until it stops this further breach of international law . #% The focus is on solving the problem of foam caused by surfactants in our water systems . #% While there may still be some inefficiencies in that market , it certainly does not reflect the whole picture . #% Finally , on the argument about militarisation : as a Irishman it makes me sick in the pit of my stomach to listen to lectures from Mr Adams and other people in Sinn Féin who today still maintain an armed ceasefire in Northern Ireland , who refuse to decommission weapons , and who , prior to their entry into a peace process , sullied the name of Irishmen through a campaign of murder and terror for three decades . #% There are 18 million long-term unemployed in Europe at the moment . #% Mr President , I wish to bring a very important matter to your attention . #% In technical terms , the amendments ensure that certain draft decisions taken by the Commission are recognised as delegated acts as defined in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union . #% The Commissioner spoke of extraordinary amounts of money , which I think he said were largely unrecognised . #% Mr President , the evidence coming from Bosnia in particular points clearly to a massive increase in cases of cancer where bombings took place during the Balkans war and where ammunition rounds of depleted uranium were used . #% This was an important decision , affirming the EU ' s readiness to provide humanitarian and development assistance to the people of Afghanistan . #% I shall not attend such a meeting because it seems to me you should make a ruling from the Chair and we should be done with the matter . #% I welcome the debate today and I look forward to the debate in the national parliaments in the months ahead . #% The writing is on the wall . #% They certainly have not been told . #% This greatly concerns the Irish fishermen as Ireland has experimented with alternatives to bottom trawlers and so far no success has been achieved . #% On the basis of the EU 's own figures , Egypt is expected to lose 1.5 million jobs . #% The one plea I would make , and we have already asked Parliament 's Constitutional Affairs Committee to deal with this question with some urgency , is that before us now is the responsibility , among other things , to begin to implement one major part of the structural economic reform programme of Lisbon , namely to create a single European market for financial services . #% We read of horrors of the past regimes of Pol Pot and Stalin and it haunts me to think that the same situation exists in North Korea today . #% At this point I would like to make clear that this report does not deal with hunting in Europe . #% It will destroy the market for producers , it will ruin consumer confidence and it is something we should seek to avoid . #% Could you confirm that specifically ? #% in writing . - This draft resolution calls for the strengthening of safety and security standards on EU oil platforms and an EU capacity disaster response in the event of an oil spill in EU waters . #% I do not think anybody in this house could in any way condone the violent reaction in certain countries in the Middle East to the publication of those cartoons and caricatures . #% Madam President , I shall deal with two main points in this question of enlargement . #% Mr President , those who declare that they are dedicated to fighting terrorism need to cleanse themselves of all hypocrisy and must condemn those who carry out the worst acts of bloodletting under the guise of freedom fighters . #% At least that has allowed us not to have to come back after 9 p.m. #% I , along with all members of the House , would not condone any terrorism , whether institutional or paramilitary . #% Whilst we all await with great uncertainty and excitement the outcome of the Convention , it plays no role whatsoever in forming the basis of our work today . #% This would mean that antibiotic-resistant products that have already been authorised would remain . #% Too often in the past the Commission presented Parliament with a long list of planned initiatives covering a wide range of policy areas . #% For ten years Kosovo has beckoned us . #% The European Treaties have espoused a need for the freedom of movement of goods , persons and services within the territories of the European Union . #% Finally , I call on the Commission to clarify the legal base of the peace programme and enable resources to be allocated to the International Fund for Ireland . #% I should also like to know if the Commission has any legal advice on this matter . #% Madam President , I was a journalist at the height of the BSE crisis , so I have very vivid memories of the unfolding of that story and its impact not just on politicians but on consumer confidence . #% The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003 , and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement . #% That , of course , distorts the employment criteria and , indeed , our unemployment figures . #% Since 11 September this has become even more important . #% Indeed , how does it link this to the Lisbon agenda ? #% All of us have benefited from the in-depth and often intense debate on enlargement that has just taken place in my own country . #% Reducing European farmers ' capacity and hampering their competitiveness and viability with a weak CAP budget would be counterproductive and short-sighted . #% It is little wonder that Turkey does not participate . #% Yes , I agree with an awful lot has been done and we need what is proposed before us here today , but I would rather we use the OIE or WTO standard , so that all countries could agree on the classification , so that what we do in Europe would not be considered a trade barrier by the rest of the world with whom we must trade our meat products and live animals . #% Considering that we are voting on the Reding report on terrorism today , it would be appropriate for this House to commemorate and pay tribute to the victims of state terrorism , as well as all forms of paramilitary terrorism in our fight to ensure that people 's lives and the right to life is secured for ever . #% I rose to ask you to inform me further - as you have already done in writing - about an issue I raised some time back . #% We may not achieve those with the proposals contained in this report . #% The way Members of this House , across all political groups , have responded to date has been extremely heartening . #% It is a privilege for me to be part of a process that can begin to ensure that this protection is provided . #% 17 % of all expenditure carried out on improving our roads , water treatment and transport networks under our capital programme originates from the European regional cohesion funds . #% Thank you , President-in-Office , for your comprehensive reply to the first part of my question . #% The European framework has been good for Ireland . #% Secondly , with regard to enlargement and integration capacity , particularly as regards Turkey , despite the efforts of some people to try to simplify the issue of Turkey in terms of being in favour of or against Cyprus , Cyprus is a single , separate issue . #% Why do you not listen ? #% Mr President , I also wish to join in this debate on the candidature of the President-designate , Mr Barroso . #% When a new President was brought in , Israel said it could not deal with him , it could not negotiate with him and they were backed up all the time by the Americans and by certain Member States of the European Union . #% The Committee on Legal Affairs has voted through an amendment tabled by Lord Inglewood which would recognise surveyors as being qualified to design buildings . #% 
The first opportunity is to create a partnership for cooperation and the management of the increased trading activities . #% I have heard no-one here today deny that overexposure to sunlight is dangerous and can be deadly , yet we have these games being played . #% However , I welcome the response , as now set out by the Commission President . #% If the revision of the TEN guidelines were to concentrate just on existing bottlenecks as announced by the Commission in its work programme for the year 2000 , this would focus the funding on the more economically developed central regions of the Union , perhaps to the detriment of the outermost regions . #% If we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion . #% It states that the parties are a factor for integration , they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union . #% I agree fully with those who expressed their reservations today in relation to the Commission proposals on the cereals sector . #% This is enshrined in all our constitutions as well as the constitutions of those accession countries joining the European Union in enlargement . #% Thus , we need to balance animal welfare requirements in the EU with ensuring a viable industry survives . #% I was disappointed to note that certain Member States continue to oppose the inclusion of a chapter on employment policy in the new Treaty . #% For the Parliament , this entire debate has represented a coming of age , a new maturity in understanding our democratic rights and our capacity and our duty to act in the public interest when we assert them . #% The two projects I referred to are European models of best practice in this area and could be replicated throughout the EU-25 . #% As far as innovation and research are concerned , we look forward to a detailed Sixth Framework Programme . #% If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year . #% We need to look seriously and seek to engage with those sections of the communities of Europe that are alienated to the point of murder and terror . #% We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community , especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country , for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government . #% They are a signal of the new era of which you speak and I wish to welcome that on behalf of my group . #% The exclusion of inshore fishing from current Community legislation is creating an environment in which mere survival is questionable . #% We should be training people in research management and ethics . #% It is easy to exaggerate the contribution from aviation to the present problem of climate change , and emissions from all transport sectors are of concern to the air quality issue and the climate change debate , which is the number one item on every environment agenda . #% Because of the current reform process in the sugar sector , it is time for all the governments concerned , all the relevant Commission directorates and the commercial sector to act and seriously re-examine the possibility of developing a sugar-based bio-ethanol industry . #% So we have to find an acceptable position . #% Are people who specialize in producing female animals rather than male animals going to be left out once again ? #% Other forms of gambling are limited to over-18s . #% These people are suffering doubly : they are also suffering from the consequences of climate change . #% However , as was said on a number of occasions in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we are starting with a flawed proposal . #% No wonder The Wall Street Journal the other day carried an article with Adams and bin Laden linked together . #% A strong call should go from this Parliament tomorrow that the Conventions need to be reviewed and that we need to get serious about how we are handling the drug issue . #% I have presented to the Commissioner a large print copy of the report and would like to remind colleagues that it is available in this form in various languages . #% The human rights problems in Tibet , Belarus and so on are hard to comprehend . #% People are trying to put pressure on Ireland to say that if do not vote `` yes '' we will be stopping enlargement when this is not the case . #% As well as that , there are still no arrangements to ensure the safe delivery of her unborn child . #% This would mean a reduction in the EU budget over time . #% Parliamentary investigations are necessary , particularly in countries like my own , Ireland , where it has been established that 50 CIA flights have landed at Irish airports and that the aircraft used to transfer Abu Omar illegally from Italy to Egypt , via Germany , also landed at an Irish airport . #% Our belief is that there is a clear political and a financial market expectation that Dublin II will deliver the Eurostatute , ERM II and the stability pact . #% It is time the European Union insisted that this resolution bring about real and sustained results . #% The UK initiative and the Severn Estuary strategy , involving 12 local authorities , have only secured funding for the next six months . #% Economic losses due to weather-related natural catastrophes have increased six-fold since the 1960s . #% If for example a terrorist attack using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons were to be launched at sea , a coastguard could be the first line of response . #% At the same time , we have a promise on page 12 that measures to complete the internal market , by eliminating barriers to the provision and take-up of services by business and consumers , will proceed next year . #% So the long arm of the European Union 's excess capacity reaches out even as far as there . #% With 1 % of the Community 's population , to our shame we in Ireland have been generating 10 % of the Commission 's environmental complaints . #% Unfortunately , we still have a debate about children who are apparently trapped , waiting for adoption out of Romania . #% Firstly , on 9 October 2002 , the Commission concluded that 10 candidate countries were in a position to accede to the European Union . #% Is there proper fostering in place and are there pending cases still unresolved ? #% They are a new breed of people who are mainly women , caring for elderly and disabled relatives on a continuous basis with no recognition for the work which they put in ; with no recognition of the savings which they make for the community in which they live ; with no recognition of the contribution they are making to social solidarity by maintaining people within the home as much as possible . #% Manufacturers of cars have been selling cars to countries like Ireland , where there is a high rate of VRT , at a much cheaper rate than they have been selling them to other countries that have no VRT or very low rates of it . #% - The European Parliament will vote on 12 April , to adopt a new directive on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) . #% We then should allow Member States to establish threshold values for a range of other substances . #% Another lesson that is important , not from SAVE I but from the regional programme , is that you must incorporate measures on energy efficiency into the regional work of the EU and its policies . #% Concerning the comments by the Burmese Government , they are wholly unacceptable and uncivilized in the circumstances . #% We should stand with workers in China . #% Defensive and frustrating action is possible with shareholder approval . #% The mudflat at Stregrennan , which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage . #% Our farmers , who are guardians of the rural environment , could and would seriously contribute to controlling climate change by alternative use of agricultural land for the production of alternative and renewable sources . #% Matters falling outside the remit of directives , such as indirect advertising or billboards and cinema advertising , remain within the competence of the individual Member States . #% When it comes to sanctions , we really need to answer the call that we should implement economic sanctions against the SPDC and that we should be ending all links between Europe and Burma based on trade , investment and , in particular , tourism . #% Since Ireland joined the European Union - I only mention Ireland because I am very familiar with what happened obviously , but you can draw lessons for other areas - our many small farms were reduced gradually in number . #% That is why the issue must be addressed in the context of overall development strategy and poverty alleviation . #% The Commission has proposed a lifting of this ban in Northern Ireland . #% I am disappointed with the answer to the question . #% Do we need legislation ? #% I want clarity on this . #% Commissioner Barroso and colleagues , please go for it ! #% I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament . #% So it is necessary to apply the law so that they will be forced to take rest and forced not to be on the road when they are simply too tired to drive . #% 
Within the constraints of the budget and of sound macro-economic policy - I underline those as President Prodi has already done - strictly speaking our European social models offer a welfare safety net . #% My staff have been bullied to the extent that one of them had to take days off with a stress-related illness . #% Berthelisme , of course , Mr President , is not confined to the corridors of power of the European Commission . #% On a broader budgetary matter , I welcome the fact that under the 2004 budget Parliament 's Committee on Budgets supports the following measures : the need to increase rural development aid measures under the EU common agricultural policy ; the need to guarantee the safety of food products , both from within the territories of the Union and from third countries ; greater co-ordination of security measures at the EU 's external borders and improved EU immigration and asylum policies ; and promotion of an EU media space to disseminate information on the workings of the European Union and raise public awareness of the impact of European Union legislation on the day-to-day lives of the citizens of Europe . #% Export costs and excess costs to the market put these regions at a major disadvantage . #% in writing . - One of the most pressing challenges in the current economic climate is that of youth unemployment . #% Let me begin by welcoming the moves made by the Irish presidency so far towards garnering consensus for the draft Constitutional Treaty . #% High exposure can cause severe lung , prostate and kidney cancer . #% It is in the interest of all the contracting parties that the bottom-line issues that remain outstanding are debated , resolved and finalised . #% The question of the Structural Funds has to be looked at in depth . #% We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting . #% I am very concerned that the Irish Government is complacent in its attitude towards its Kyoto Protocol commitments , which they entered into in December 1997 . #% Animals and , most importantly , people in the area suffer from an incredible range -- a tragic range -- of diseases , the kind that demonstrate an environmental attack on the immune system . #% We must continue with the voluntary ethos . #% The opening of a new air traffic control centre in England is four years behind . #% If Kohl or Mitterrand had been at the table last weekend , we would have had a conclusion . #% We need to speed up the development of alternative testing . #% I believe that the promise of solving illnesses , increasing yield and cleaning up the environment etc remain to be proven . #% Secondly , there is the ECJ 's consistent case-law according to which there should be a sole legal base which reflects the preponderant purpose or the centre of gravity of the legislation . #% Perhaps it is only a problem of interpretation , but some of the suggestions for the fast-track approach seem to be saying we have to cut through some of the present legal impediments for instance with regard to the right of appeal . #% Mr President , as a representative from Ireland , I wish to express my deep opposition to the Commission 's proposals which we know are aimed at reducing the size of the European fishing fleet by 40 % over the next six years . #% I would add that I hope it will also be a fair conclusion . #% You will realise that , President , having been an active member of the Committee on Fisheries in the past . #% A Community and patenting system must also be enacted within the Union . #% I quote the words of the Commission : `` Unlike beef and other commodities , the Community is deficient in sheepmeat and , under the present regimes , there is a major exodus from sheep production , especially in northern Europe . #% I would like to bring to your attention a delegation that has gone from this House to look at the construction known colloquially as ` the wall ' . #% They are imported from Thailand and distributed by a vast network of counterfeiters across the region . #% Mr President , we can not deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light . #% President , we can only vote on the amendment in front of us and the amendment in front of us asks for four words to be deleted . #% As well as that we have two major problems with the Commission 's proposal . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Ebner on this excellent report on regional and lesser-used languages . #% It was a pleasure and a privilege having you as our President for the last two and half years and for me personally , as someone who supported you unequivocally on the important day at the beginning of your term of Presidency , I am very happy to say that you have succeeded beyond all my hopes and expectations . #% To give you one example , in Ireland telephone line rental for people who are on the old age pension is free . #% On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today : to vote in favour , to vote against or to abstain . #% He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State . #% I know it is of concern not only to Danish Members but to the House generally . #% In summary , the fleet reduction is urgently needed and it must be vigorously implemented . #% Concerning the multinational force , it seems that Canada is perfectly willing to lead such a force but someone is blocking it . #% The Irish presidency also pledges that it will be highlighting conventional arms issues . #% Socrates phase one has been a very worthwhile experiment in transnational education . #% It would be an extremely important achievement throughout the Union if our young citizens got free access to these services at a training level . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response and understanding that actions have been taken , words have been said . #% If we stop that trade , animals will still move to Lebanon , perhaps from Australia and other areas . #% We must remember that the CAP is not just for farmers : it provides us with a safe and secure food supply and wide-ranging public goods and environmental benefits . #% The Commission 's communication is a first step towards having a strategy that covers prevention and recycling . #% It is worth noting , at the same time , that trade in agricultural products represented less than 6 % of total global trade in 2000 . #% The Commission currently contributes financially to the creation of European biofuel projects . #% However , we are still very much at a disadvantage because many European Union countries appear to have a persistent record of failure to implement the Hague Convention . #% Without patent protection the small company could have found itself in a perverse situation where its R&D efforts would have been free for the multinational company which , with its team of patent lawyers , would have gained the patent in this area . #% Therefore I propose under Rule 155 to add ' [ 18 months after the date of publication ] ' as the date for transposition . #% We are planting 25 , 000 hectares annually at the moment . #% The points that they touch on are very important . #% I appeal to you , Mr President , to ensure that we proceed in that way . #% Indeed , the Presidency document on urban exchange produced a very good exchange of experience on looking at a comprehensive approach to regeneration , to tackle problems faced by disadvantaged people concentrated in particular areas , to look at town centre management and to address urban quality issues . #% Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past ? #% Not trying out failed systems of the past , not trying out failed mechanisms of the past , but dealing with the reality of what we are presented with . #% It is only right and proper that this matter of taxation is left in the domain of Member States , which must have the final say as to what taxation policies , at local or national level , it wishes to pursue . #% Therefore any improvement in the position of individual farmers has come at the expense of employment in the sector . #% Such a document would ensure that a set of internationally agreed objectives be drawn up in close cooperation with other countries , most notably the United States of America , and would encourage simplified regulatory governance of the Internet . #% There is a public outcry in Ireland . #% I therefore would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work , to support her in making the case for a strong regional policy and for keeping the focus on our goal of economic and social cohesion . #% Let us be very clear about what this is all about : not just democracy and human rights . #% And advances in technology with new research techniques mean that the people employed in this sector are generally very highly qualified . #% Mr President , I join in the congratulations to all involved with this matter . #% We have heard from admirers of Jean Monnet this morning - I am also an admirer of Jean Monnet . #% Therefore , while I welcome what the Commissioner has said , I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be . #% 
The unfolding economic policy procedures must not be allowed to lapse into an intergovernmental mode . #% We , the EU , could not act . #% That is a serious issue . #% Taoiseach , your government has cultivated Ireland 's image in Europe as a success story , the once poor nation made good , but this House deserves to know what lies behind this so-called success . #% If Burma is admitted the EU must raise its ongoing abuse of human rights there at every opportunity . #% Issues , including the status of Jerusalem , the borders of the Palestinian State , the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees , were all being discussed between the two sides last year . #% We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear , appropriate and speedy legislation . #% Obviously , we would not want to have guaranteed prices and intervention and export refunds . #% The reality is , of course , that we must try and find solutions and work towards them . #% China seems unwilling to accept binding targets . #% If one considers the problems we have in EU waters , one can see the potential of an EU coastguard . #% Mr President , again I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Secondly , the whole area of innovation , and about looking to see where jobs are going to come from in the future and making sure people have the skills and the training for that . #% Therefore I leave it to Commissioner Bolkestein to try to find a solution that will satisfy some of my constituents back in the north-west of England . #% There are eleven participating countries within the new euro currency zone encompassing over 291 million people . #% However , the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long , and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up . #% Even though I do not subcribe to all the proposals put forward by the rapporteur , I personally believe that he has come up with a very balanced approach towards resolving the problem . #% The second is to ensure that the commitments we are making will be met , and the third is to talk about property rights and the vulnerability of people living , for example , in shacks built on property they do not own . #% As you mentioned yesterday , Commissioner , it is always easier to find reasons not to do something . #% My purpose in being here is to defend and promote the interests and good name of Northern Ireland and to secure for its people their fair share of European funding . #% Equally , it remains the preserve of the 15 Member States of the EU to maintain law and order within their own countries while safeguarding their internal security . #% We have to look at how the European Union Member States fuel conflicts around the world and human rights abuses . #% The international community should take note of this . #% After all , the European Parliament has the final say in whether an applicant country joins or not . #% We really need to ask whether the economic model of plundering natural resources , without any regard for the people or the ecology , is acceptable . #% Let us learn and apply that lesson . #% Mr President , I rise to support Mr Cornelissen , Mrs Ewing and Mr Miller . #% We all wish the IGC could have concluded in December . #% Last week a key committee in the Irish Parliament also voted to reject this unethical research . #% In my contribution to yesterday 's debate I highlighted the urgency of implementing a full traceability programme from producer to consumer . #% If that is not forthcoming , then we should act on our own . #% The `` European economic Recovery Plan '' put as priority areas the Lisbon strategy and energy ( with a special attention of energy efficiency in buildings ) . #% First of all , most of the investment in Ireland is in entirely new projects and does not involve the relocation of jobs . #% You are not isolated . #% I have in my hand the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee report published on 24 October . #% Until then , however , we have found a way which allows us to continue to enforce our own stricter requirements under the transitional period before we move , in line with other EU Member States , to the general regime . #% Liberalization of gas markets in Europe must not mean higher prices for the consumer , which is the fear of many consumer associations . #% The Middle East process has a better chance of success if the European Union and the United States work together with all the key contracting parties in the region so as to ensure that the present road map for peace guarantees both Israeli and Palestinian statehood and security in the region . #% All too often the real movers and shakers in this area are the NGOs who are , invariably , inadequately funded and constantly knocking on the door to try and bring these issue to the public . #% It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers . #% If France and Germany can seek changes to the Lisbon Treaty , it is vitally important that the UK Government use the renegotiation process to win back powers to our sovereign parliament . #% This must be achieved by ensuring greater enforcement of our road safety legislation and improving the quality of our road driving . #% One must remember that the Ottawa Convention on Marine Pollution has at its core the principle of substantially reducing the use of radioactive substances . #% Professionals more qualified than I have proven that this is not so . #% Paedophilia on the Internet must be prosecuted . #% A human right that every single person in this House would support is the right of little children to go to school unhindered and unterrorised . #% We also want to protect the open-source community which makes a vital contribution to competitiveness in the area of software development . #% I deem this to be very serious and would ask Members to consider the fact that , while many might not fully understand the science of this , if we do not accept the Socialist amendment and accept the PPE amendment , it means that we are going against the advice of scientists and are creating two total allowable catch areas within a single stock . #% I believe very strongly that Parliament and the Commission have been very ably served by the Commissioners from small countries -- naturally , in this context I think of my own country . #% Also , his comments here this evening were thoughtful and informative . #% I believe that this directive is an own goal . #% This report is a restatement that Europe 's core values of equality , solidarity , redistribution and anti-discrimination , care for the young , the old and the sick through universal public provision must be defended in the necessary reforms already under way ; that our social model is not an obstacle to competitiveness and growth but is , in fact , a necessary ingredient if we are to deliver the kind of decent European society that our citizens clearly desire ; and that the concept of ` flexicurity ' , pioneered by my colleague Mr Rasmussen in Denmark , can help facilitate reforms by preventing people from tumbling into poverty as a result and can , if properly tailored to each Member State 's needs , be an important tool in the process . #% Between legal fees , translation fees and implementation fees , it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State . #% Europe can not , on the one hand , work with democratic movements in Libya , Syria , Tunisia and Egypt , and refuse to work with a government democratically elected by the Palestinian people . #% As a result of a recent competition policy decision , over EUR 1 billion of much-needed UK regional regeneration investment in poor urban areas and derelict sites has been cut by 75 % . #% Moreover , action can only follow , as a result of a justified and proportionate request by the claimant , on the authority of a competent judge or court and only for intentional infringements on a commercial scale . #% The Commission is always reminding us of this , but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial . #% If we do not give the skills to our people in order to take advantage of new employment opportunities that are out there , then we deny them the real human and civil rights of participating fully in society . #% I am at a loss to understand how such transcripts of a criminal nature can be published . #% Environmental complaints are also made on major developments where it is felt that their impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people in the areas affected is being ignored by the developers and in some cases by the authorities concerned . #% The actions and statements of the Sinn Féin leadership over the last few months have failed to make any significant progress in getting justice for the McCartney family . #% To summarise : What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid ? #% This happened when Egyptian security forces evacuated by force about 2500 Sudanese migrants , refugees and asylum seekers who had settled in front of the UNHCR headquarters , requesting to be relocated to third countries . #% Given that , as it now stands , companies can opt in or opt out , we would end up with 28 tax bases instead of the current 27 ; that is hardly simplification . #% Mr President , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this very important subject . #% Mining and quarrying waste accounts for nearly 30 % of the annual EU waste , which equals hundreds of millions of tons of waste . #% 
I would ask the Conservative Party to address those issues rather than resort to the wrecking tactics which they employed in committee . #% I stress this is only the beginning of a process of stricter and more rigorous financial control and accountability . #% When we ring from Parliament I have noticed a considerable willingness on the part of many authorities , legal and social , to take these cases seriously and to give us wonderful help in the process . #% It is already prohibited in catfoods so there are serious question marks hanging over it . #% What will be the situation in relation to headage payments . #% Madam President , I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur and , indeed , the Commission for bringing up this issue again . #% We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up . #% Mr President , it has indeed been a long , hard road . #% Despite propaganda that these were terrorists , in the main , they were , in fact , impoverished farmers from the north and around Bangkok , sections of the urban working class , and their families , who saw their protest as a struggle against the enormous poverty and hardship that they suffer . #% That does not prevent us from maintaining a critical perspective , with regard to the seriousness of the ETA organisation 's commitment to making the necessary compromises . #% Recently the British Government White Paper : Competitiveness - Helping Business to Win said that small firms pay a vital role in the economy . #% But , likewise , the same mistakes that were made by governments at the start of the 20th century seem to be repeated today at the start of the 21st century . #% My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods , and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter . #% Mr President , each year in Europe alone 38,000 animals are routinely killed after being used to test the development of new cosmetic products . #% The prevention of waste is one of the ways of tackling it , because the disposal of waste -- whether through landfill or incineration -- causes health and environmental problems . #% I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this , by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty . #% The Community is asking that they reduce the fishing effort , their tonnage of boats and their intake . #% We respect , and must respect , the three institutions and the role that they have to play . #% The question at issue is whether , and if so under what conditions , a derogation may be made from the normal rules governing design protection , that is exclusive rights , to enable third parties to use spare parts without the authorization of the right-holder for the purpose of repairing complex products , such as motor vehicles . #% The one-stop-shop schemes , which are at the heart of the package , will ultimately enable new rules for cross-border businesses and business-to-consumer services to be introduced . #% I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today 's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea . #% Very sadly , we so often see those who carry out the crime get more sympathy and more support than the victim who was on the receiving end of what happened . #% We all know that children under three put toys in their mouths . #% The next section relates to the death penalty , an area where the European Union has had a lot of success in influencing its neighbours through the Neighbourhood Policy and has brought about a moratorium on the death penalty in many countries . #% Environmental impacts of gear are a very important factor . #% The protection of the European Union 's 370 million consumers is of paramount importance . #% Firstly , legislation is what works . #% I recognize that even though it is a Friday morning it was on Friday mornings in this Parliament that we eventually brought this problem to the attention of the Commission . #% Every image of the dead in Gaza inflames people across the Arab world , and I am worried that the essential tenet of the Middle East peace process is slipping away : the so-called two-state solution , an independent Palestinian state coexisting in peace with Israel . #% As the leaders of the largest republican party in the six counties , and in particular after last week 's election , they have a duty to separate the cause of Irish Republicanism from the acts of common criminals . #% So I ask myself : do we really need to go the wall about a political issue like this ? #% The Union must continue to take structural measures to encourage balanced development around the Union and to avoid a drift to the centre by mobile investment . #% Farmers should take heart that this Parliament understands their concerns . #% The support project for Northern Ireland for peace and reconciliation is a model of grass-roots activism and could be a model for this particular proposal here in listening closely to the grass roots and giving them support . #% Is the President-in-Office aware that the Council can change the designation of wool as an agricultural product ? #% The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK . #% This survey also showed that consumers are still charged a lot more for making cross-border transfers than they are for making national transfers . #% In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological . #% From an Irish perspective , we view the proposal very positively . #% However , I would warn against making widespread changes or reducing the powers contained within the Stability and Growth Pact . #% The internal market should not be a free-for-all for big business , leading to SMEs being squeezed out of markets with the result that consumers have less choice . #% If this is not reversed , then , quite frankly , the European Union will be guilty of putting the dairy farmers in my region out of business . #% The nuclear industry is clearly out of control . #% I would like to express my admiration for those who responded to the tragedy but also , if possible , to request some help with re-housing many of those who lost their homes in this tragedy . #% One key element that is lacking with regard to the overall structure is the financial support available to cities to undertake the necessary infrastructural work required to meet the demands for capital of culture status . #% The fact is that some 30 000 patents for computer-implemented inventions have been handed out by the European Patent Office and indeed national patent offices . #% It would be most unfortunate if you should start in a procedure where you are legitimate in the context of a Commission as college - I speak not of individuals but of a college - which itself is discredited . #% The current directive has been amended five times since 1970 and has never been consolidated . #% Are we willing to accept the scenario of uncertainty regarding the food we feed our children , in the light of food safety scares such as mad cow disease , CJD , or avian influenza ? #% Markets are becoming increasingly liberalized as has been said by other Members in the debate , and this inevitably means that overseas competition will intensify . #% Alternative energy sources are vital for our future . #% We are a proud people , proud of our long-term record of peacekeeping and peace-enforcing by our defence forces throughout the trouble spots of the world . #% That is why it is important at this juncture in the European Parliament that when we speak about education we make sure that it is all-inclusive . #% However , it is with some concern that I read in some newspaper reports back in Ireland that the Taoiseach is putting forward a suggestion for a European coastguard . #% It is also important to factor into these calculations the huge benefits of issues such as improved security for countries such as Germany and Austria , as the Union 's external border takes a decisive step to the east . #% Parliament needs to reject this and as a member of the British Parliament I will be voting against it in my own Parliament . #% With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro , our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border transactions remains fragmented , resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions . #% Training can not replace a poor education and there is considerable risk that those with a strong education base will benefit further from lifelong learning and those without it will become even further marginalised . #% It also underlines a greater need for widespread policing in Northern Ireland . #% Madam President , I voted in favour of this report but extremely reluctantly . #% Instead of revising them every year , why not make it every three or four years to ensure again that they can be seen to operate within the mechanisms and systems that they are emerging from ? #% In the area of smoking , legislators have come to recognise the significance of passive smoking and have taken measures to defend the people who are near the smoker . #% This was the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years . #% That clearly is a farce in anyone 's analysis . #% We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments . #% The only problem is that the rapporteur may have done too good a job . #% 
- There must be full cooperation of all the Member States within the European Union if we are to play our full part in reducing the level of greenhouse emissions which are presently playing such a destructive role within our global environment . #% I am fairly sceptical about whether or not ITER will proceed within this framework programme , but we will see . #% If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success . #% We need to pay particular attention to our prisons . #% Mr President , I appreciate and thank you for your kind words . #% I believe that the international community , including the European Union and the United Nations , must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered . #% While we accept the possibilities of biotechnology , the ethical issues must be widely addressed . #% It is obvious that Syria , Iran , Cuba indeed , and North Korea are also on the agenda . #% There is a further consequence which links in with our debate here some time ago on the coming into operation of the Treaty of Amsterdam , that is the question of employment . #% Each category of waste should be subject to treatment which is specific to it . #% As usual he has crystallized this whole idea and put it very well . #% Please tell us before you go today exactly what you intend to do to make the Lisbon goals a reality during your watch . #% We have to work for them , using this Constitution as the basis for our work . #% That is essential . #% By virtue of the fact that they were actually living on an island that was a British island , they should have rights as EU citizens . #% Scientists who deliberately ignore these safeguards are doing a disservice to science and are acting contrary to the common good . #% I believe she has crystallised a lot of the hard work that has gone into this subject . #% I would like to know if there is any indication that markets themselves are responding to what is an increasing number of single people perhaps just looking for ` the blessed peace of the single bed ' , to quote George Bernard Shaw . #% We must monitor the economic consequences of the problem and ensure the effects are minimal . #% It is interesting to look around at other regions of the world to see how they deal with by-catch problems . #% It is clear from the Presidency Conclusions that the financial perspective , as laid down in Berlin in 1999 , is going to be respected in its entirety . #% Existing arrangements for access to the Irish box must be retained permanently in the reform process . #% Indeed , it is also important that we should seek ways to press the Valencian Government to put a moratorium on new projects , pending the implementation of a satisfactory new law which meets the full requirements of the European Union . #% Under it the precious Constitution has been shipwrecked on the rocks of rejection and the budget is an unmitigated shambles , with rancour , as in Mr Juncker 's speech today , being its currency . #% We can not just let it remain outside Parliamentary control although it has been useful in some respects . #% The peace of mind which the families of these ` disappeared ' need is more important than the security and safety of the perpetrators of these murders . #% There are , however , some negative developments . #% The paramilitary groups have to be dismantled , the crimes have to be investigated , and those responsible have to be held accountable . #% Mr President , the Heads of State and Government have set an ambitious target in trying to find agreement on the Agenda 2000 package at the March summit . #% We have to be certain that the wrong signals are not sent to the Serbian regime , that it is possible for the Kosovars to return home eventually to safety . #% Furthermore , should EID be introduced it should only apply to animals born after a certain date and should not apply to existing stock . #% I think by the time of the Dublin European Council we will see real progress . #% I particularly welcome this report and its emphasis on the regional administration of the structural funds . #% Single-handedly he has caused his country 's political isolation . #% So if we can save a child 's life , until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question , we will have to allow controlled use . #% Mr President , purgatory is just as painful as hell , but you do not stay there permanently -- I am told . #% This House , as an institution , and the Irish people , need to guarantee that we can deliver on ratification of the Treaty of Nice in the short term . #% However , I also expressed concerns with regard to some of the amendments adopted by the committee and to some of the stances taken within the committee . #% The real audience are our citizens and the countries of the European Union need to bring governments closer to the citizens . #% I strongly support the proposed amendments to the Commission 's text on respecting human rights and humanitarian need . #% I strongly support paragraphs 16 and 17 , which call for informing the European public about scientific achievements and looking at ethical questions . #% I believe that if we get it right it will be a victory for parliamentary democracy and a boost to jobs and growth for future generations of Europeans . #% So the Moscow mechanism is not an exclusive one and , on balance , it would appear that sending such a delegation without the cooperation of the recipient state would not be advantageous on this occasion . #% I look forward to very fruitful relations continuing between the EU and Saudi Arabia . #% It is a semi-state company and it is responsible for forestry development . #% In rural areas , for many years , even before the Irish Free State came into existence , we sometimes had this service of a post office . #% Two weeks ago , a poultry-processing plant in Northern Ireland closed with the loss of over 400 jobs , not to mention the other jobs on the farms and in the feed compound mills . #% in writing . - We can not wait for another catastrophe before acting to protect air passengers . #% This is also in line with the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Portugal . #% Anyone or any Government who objects to this now will have some serious questions to answer to the European citizen . #% We need the macro-economic distribution key to be resolved sooner and not later . #% I also want to mention the Minister for European Affairs , Mr Dick Roche , who here in Parliament was so open to meeting with individuals and political groups , who engaged fully with all Members on any issues or discussions that needed to be carried out - not only with regard to the Treaty , but also with regard to ongoing political developments here within Parliament . #% In one sense , we tend to forget what it was like at the end of the 19th century when the elderly , the sick or the unemployed had no protection whatsoever until a miserly amount of money was introduced in the late 1870s to try to give some protection to older people . #% Where , then , does that leave this decision by Parliament , and would the Council suggest that all Member States would need to put such a framework in place immediately ? #% That should be clarified . #% In reality , however , we also have to realise that a lot of oppressive legislation has been brought in recently just one of the things mentioned tonight is the European arrest warrant and at the very least we need something to counterbalance that to ensure the rights of suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings . #% I believe the amendment covers an adequate compromise . #% After the adoption and publication of this regulation , data brought to the attention of the Commission necessitated its incorporation into this regulation . #% We will not have the entire picture until the relevant daughter directives are in place over the next few years . #% I agree with Mr Martínez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims . #% A report by the Irish General Council of County Councils , published in June , warned that a nuclear accident at Sellafield could result in a disaster ten to a hundred times worse than Chernobyl . #% We know that a great deal of the EWL budget goes to coordination and research , but EWL does not offer financial aid to the associations that make it up . #% Madam President , I should like to welcome Commissioner Kyprianou here this evening and say that we look forward to welcoming him to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . #% From an Irish perspective , I am particularly satisfied that this programme is advancing at a very swift pace . #% Education must always be a priority of spending programmes as it is the way in which we build the future . #% If you present us with very vague proposals , that will certainly delay implementation and lead to concern and disappointment throughout the EU . #% 
As I will not have the opportunity to do so later on in the debate , I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to all those in New Orleans and elsewhere in the United States who have lost relatives , friends , and indeed belongings , as a result of the catastrophe following Hurricane Katrina . #% My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another . #% A lot of people are talking about this , but very little gets done . #% Hence my question to the President-in-Office about the Council ' s position : what actions can be taken to ensure the continuance of this very strong sector ? #% Secondly , the whole question of how one disposes of nuclear waste . #% The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq . #% Is its future to be shaped by people who genuinely subscribe to the Irish peace process and to the resolution of the problem in Ireland by democratic means , or are Sinn Féin and the IRA controlled by people who are prepared to tolerate and even support criminal acts of murder ? #% Before they ever reach this stage , our Department of Agriculture is seeing fit to exclude them from certain premium payments by making an assessment against them for this off-farm income . #% Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering ? #% I also hope he will encourage all the Member States to honour and sign the various international conventions which remain unsigned by some Member States - conventions , for example , on money-laundering , on the internationalization of organized crime and , of course , on cooperation between the police forces within the Community . #% . Discussions are already under way in relation to how the EU budget for the year 2000 will be disbursed . #% I welcome the fact that he has given a commitment that he will hold elections , but the international community must not allow him to turn his back on this commitment . #% That is especially so in a country like mine , Ireland , which has the strongest economy in Europe while its health service is inadequate and people are put at risk because they can not get the basic health services they need . #% I have heard precious little from him since having presided over the Liberal group he got political asylum in the EPP Group some years ago . #% I recall that the Nice Council before Christmas set out a number of guidelines for new social policy measures . #% Secondly , the average cost increase for firms in this study would be in excess by about a hundred times that of the study carried out by the EC which stated that it would be 0.2 % . #% I did not realize until I took up this brief just how complex motor vehicles can be . #% The move to use road tax to effectively promote energy-efficient cars by charging significantly more tax for cars with bigger engines that use more fuel will mean that drivers will have to pay more for bigger and more powerful cars . #% But it seems we have ignored all the warnings . #% Have we got the right methods and mechanisms in place to resolve it ? #% Ireland is a success story , as we know , in this respect , with an economy which is performing well . #% It will speed up the process of getting rid of this unsatisfactory situation . #% The Commission must help : please , facilitate the transfer of best practice among Member States and also ensure that minimum energy-performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences . #% Respect for the dignity of the human person is a fundamental principle upheld in all European and international agreements . #% I would be grateful if I could have an answer to this supplementary . #% My only difference with the rapporteur is in relation to paragraphs 7 and 10 , where there is a call for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office . #% Now they are deciding because they do not like the politics of a specific Member of this Parliament that they are going to refuse entry . #% Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East . #% We recently voted to renew the same programme with increased funding and this will make a valuable contribution to Member States ' efforts . #% Madam President , last Sunday I returned from Iran following a political visit by Irish Members of Parliament to that country . #% Mr President , I should like to welcome the Commissioner . #% Commissioner , I know you are doing your very best in a very difficult position , but your remarks about the British Government decision yesterday are far too charitable . #% Bearing in mind the number of times that this matter has been raised in the House by all political groups , how can the Commission possibly justify its silence and inactivity on a matter of such serious public concern ? #% In the face of intimidation and threats he has fiercely defended the most basic rights of the most vulnerable in any society , the children . #% From the data which I am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact . #% We are culturally richer due to the fact that so many of these languages have survived in this multimedia globalised age and are still used on a daily basis . #% I would hope that the arrangements on surveillance on monitoring which operated in the tuna fishery in 1995 ensured that most of the difficulties of previous years were eliminated . #% Are these not our waters in that sense ? #% Madam President , I want to say something briefly about the reports by Mr Iversen and Mr Otila . #% It adds further insult to injury when one is accused of forgetting the US contribution to two world wars . #% Unfortunately , the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs goes totally against the spirit of co-operation achieved up to now . #% If Ireland is to continue providing fish to the rest of the EU and still have the means to provide for their families this is not acceptable . #% It is obvious that hydrogen energy represents an alternative to fossil fuels , but there are other possible alternatives , such as bio-energy , which is relevant to sustainable land use . #% I wish to refer in particular to the proposals on the fingerprinting of illegal immigrants . #% I have a special word of appreciation for the Irish Parliament for its pragmatic and sensible approach to this project . #% Tibet , however , is an international treasure and international treasures are not the preserve of any one people . #% Be it the IRA fire-bombing a packed hotel outside Belfast and incinerating a dozen innocent people , al-Qa ` ida attacking the twin towers , or Chechen extremists in Beslan butchering innocent children , the strategy is the same -- maximum impact through maximum carnage in the hope of extracting maximum political concession . #% Despite this , two years later in 2003 , exit penalties worth about 20 % of the value of Equitable Life policies were imposed on Irish policyholders . #% European Union leaders confronted these new challenges with vigour and determination and we are all collectively intent on tackling the scourge of terrorism . #% I agree that we need an appropriate EU-wide regulatory regime for hedge funds which will prompt them to locate in the EU , rather than offshore , and provide the benefits of a common European passport through mutual recognition . #% Such a centre would serve to create a more proactive approach to medium and longer-term industrial change which would benefit all those concerned - Commission , European Parliament , social partners , government and local authorities . #% Mr Curry had strong words for not only our Department of the Environment but also our Department of Finances policies , our Environmental Protection Agency , our Heritage Protection Agency and , indeed , our local authorities . #% I would also like to take this opportunity to say in my capacity as chairman of Parliament 's delegation for relations with South Africa , that I and my delegation colleagues have had extensive discussions with South African government ministers and representatives of NGOs concerning the European programme for reconstruction and development in South Africa . #% The cost of such procedures will of course be borne only by two groups : farmers and consumers . #% There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field . #% My last point , which is not often mentioned and which is not paid due recognition , is flexibility - the ability to adapt to changing circumstances . #% Equality of opportunity must mean that all jobs , all services that are available , are open to all equally . #% Violence against women knows no geographical boundaries , no age limit , no class or race or cultural distinctions , but it is still invisible and the victims are silenced . #% Commissioner , do not wait until the lights go out again ! #% I support a European-wide political agreement concerning the identification and confiscation of the proceeds of crime in all its forms . #% That is very worrying and the concern is well founded . #% Up to 60 % of the fish caught are canned , as Mrs Stihler has said , and much of that is eaten by us in the northern hemisphere . #% It is our task to reach agreement on how best to achieve this , bearing in mind the difficulties involved for some Member States . #% Mr President , I wish to welcome Mr Quinn here to the European Parliament and to congratulate him on the seriousness and skill of his efforts to date to work himself into the whole business of organizing the affairs of the Union for the next six months . #% I would add , though perhaps not with 100 % conviction , that the meeting that is taking place today between Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the heads of the political groups should not have been confined to the heads of the political groups . #% Convoys are not immune to terrorist attack aimed at stealing the packages containing highly radioactive substances . #% 
The motion insists on the protection of the population of Western Sahara generally and in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , specifically in the area of freedom of expression and freedom of movement and calls for any final political resolution to be consistent with international law and the relevant UN Security Council resolution . #% The only way this can be achieved is through continuous research to ensure absolute safety and maximum transparency in that research , including explanations to consumers of the technical details should they wish to avail themselves of them . #% Regrettably such disasters affect many countries at the same time . #% The decoupling of payments from production provides a new freedom to farm with , I hope , new opportunities . #% It is disgraceful for instance that they are meanstested for the carers allowance . #% This makes it rather difficult for us to do our work on separate votes and split votes in time . #% Legislation is necessary which not only protects the rights of people with disabilities but also ensures that people with disabilities are provided with support and structures that will allow them to participate on an equal footing in all aspects of life . #% The Chinese must understand that the continuation of nuclear testing is incompatible with implementation of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty . #% Consumers bear the ultimate responsibility for their own food choices . #% I want to address this paper on that basis . #% Tying education , innovation and research into a coherent supportive policy is a vital part of a functioning knowledge economy . #% GATT and the WTO have done little or nothing so far to make increased trade a reality for these very poor economies . #% I am still coming to terms with what I saw there . #% We will give it . #% Mr Sharon does a grave disservice to the people of Israel . #% The budget as a percentage of the EU Gross National Income should reflect the agreed priorities of the European Union . #% These proposals are very welcome indeed because they attempt to establish an integrated approach to water management and protection , which are very important . #% In conclusion , I believe that these Commission proposals are just that . #% The world is proud of you and especially also , of course , this Parliament of which you are a distinguished Member . #% There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs . #% We need to look at the state of stocks and what is there for fishermen . #% When you say that you can not prevent occasional shortcomings as regards freedom of the press , you have to ensure that it is prevented because Article F of the Maastricht Treaty states that the European Union shall respect the European Convention on Human Rights . #% I am surprised that there were only 47 votes in favour of this amendment , despite the fact that even my own country of Ireland complains about it . #% Recent discussions between representatives of the Palestinian authority and Prime Minister Sharon must be seen as a somewhat positive move , but negotiations must surely be meaningful and can not be seen as a cosmetic exercise under any circumstances . #% In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory . #% People who have allergies look at the list . #% In fact between1992 and 1992 the LIFE initiative cofinanced nearly 1600 projects with a total Community contribution of approximately EUR 2.1 billion . #% This is more than half the original administrative request for an increase of 5.2 % . #% If a government wanted to kick start an economic activity , through the granting of tax credits for Research and Development , that Member State would have to gain prior approval from the Council under unanimity . #% Nature abhors a vacuum and while , hopefully , we will not go back to condemning killings and burying the dead on the island of Ireland , undoubtedly street events will occur with increasing frequency if we do not hold elections . #% The Daphne Programme will aim to promote information campaigns on potential risks of violence and ways of avoiding them , encourage pilot projects and innovative measures and help to create a Community information source to assist NGOs . #% The global figure is something close to 200 million for child labour . #% The report also reflects the massive amount of work required in this area if we are to bridge the gap between rhetoric and reality . #% The secretariat was originally all in Dublin , though in recent years an antenna was opened in Brussels to carry out relations with the EU institutions . #% We are major donors but we have , unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively , as many speakers have said today , just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland . #% This is why I abstained on the final vote . #% It is clear that the proximity of residential areas to landfill sites poses a huge risk . #% Maybe the Commission will tell us how they will get out of the dilemma now that they are clearly out of touch with people . #% The proposals on agricultural reform , while an improvement on the original Commission proposals , are not a long-term solution . #% I have no doubt that the greater majority of your fishermen would ask you to do the same thing . #% Salman Rushdie 's death penalty has not really been lifted . #% Israel must be persuaded by Europe that frustrating the economic development of Gaza is counterproductive for Israel 's own security ; it should also , in my view , be counterproductive for Israel 's trade relations with Europe . #% This is going to have a knock-on effect , even in countries such as Sweden which have a tradition of much more openness . #% We can not rely in the EU on traditionally high levels of tariff and quota protection . #% In Ireland we have the scandal relating to the beef export refunds and the continuing massive transit fraud in , for example , cigarette smuggling . #% I would like to draw the House 's attention to one statement in particular : Zimbabwe 's police chief said yesterday that they must rid their country of ` the crawling mass of maggots ' . #% Your proposals , Commissioner , are totally misleading . #% The movement of this dangerous cargo at this time is spitting in the face of the victims of September 11 . #% Sometimes very small quantities of soya are used , for example in sauces and soups . #% Madam President , I congratulate Mr Viola on his report . #% However , no credible measures are proposed to improve scientific knowledge even though the shortcomings in this area are well recognised . #% Decoupling waste from our growing economies is vital . #% The creation of new European norms of behaviour in office must apply with no less force and conviction to the European Parliament than they will to any future European Commission . #% I will continue to urge that public representatives be paid an average skilled worker 's wage and to advocate the elimination of unnecessary costs , perks , benefits and other privileges . #% It very quickly became apparent that the trampling of the pilgrims ' feet and not divine intervention had , in fact , been essential to protect that particular ecosystem . #% This would be a bold step but one that can allow the European Union to increase its control , in a more realistic way , over the export of arms from European Union countries . #% The majority is as beef . #% Each and every one of the students spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their community . #% We know that FMD has been around for 400 years so modern farm practices can not be blamed for this virulent disease , but the mobility of animals today gives rise to greater risk and faster contamination . #% Often there are no sports fields or crèches and few shops . #% I am concerned that we are creating jobs which are low paid , part-time and creating a new underclass of the working poor who are existing on in-work benefits and family credit . #% After all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies . #% This report reviews the years 1996 to 1998 . #% Firstly , I wrote to you in connection with the Arias Cañete vote , because there was some confusion there . #% There was particular emphasis at this summit on the European area of research and innovation , following the excellent communication from Commissioner Busquin . #% It is time we acted . #% 
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives . #% My only words of caution are that we should not jump ahead of what the governments are willing to do , because ultimately the governments are the key representatives of their peoples and national interests . #% This is of vital concern to my own country , Ireland , and to Finland . #% It is impossible to get accurate statistics for the number of children who are missing in the European Union . #% Mr President , this is a very important report because the European Community is discussing recovery plans for fish stocks for the first time . #% Moreover , the MDGs have to be seen from a development-enabling perspective , while at the same time facing and tackling the root causes of poverty . #% This report and investigation brought home the wider effects . #% This is not just about protecting farmers ' interests ; it is also a very clear and important issue regarding food security , security of food supply and of the standard and quality of food , and security as regards ensuring that biodiversity and the available alternatives are maintained in the rural areas of Europe . #% Europe is suffering from a credibility problem and to deal with it we urgently need to evolve from rule makers to economic performers . #% I do not think that a wave of hysteria is sufficient grounds for legislation by the European Commission . #% We congratulate them . #% It is completely unacceptable that some Member States have a very good integrated coastal zone management strategy and plans , whereas other countries do not . #% Some of those who took that leap of faith in earlier times were not rewarded for their courage and now find themselves more on the periphery than holding the middle ground . #% The Council , the Council of Ministers , the presidency have to take into consideration that in Ireland the coastal regions have no alternative source of employment . #% As I know from my own experience , the principles at the heart of European Union will resolve conflict wherever they are applied in the world . #% Mr President , a number of speakers tonight have mentioned the issue of the best available technology . #% People deserve to have their health protected and not have the ball kicked into touch for a scientific investigation that may take years . #% In consequence , hundreds of exceptionally qualified young Protestant applicants have been refused admission to the police , not on merit , but because there is not a matching quantity of applicants from the Catholic community . #% I am glad that Commissioner Prodi is going to look at the EIB because , frankly , that institution is inefficient and ineffective in aiding those firms which could be innovative and competitive if they just had that helping hand . #% So it is not entirely true to say that there is nothing before the Council . #% I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure . #% Firstly , concerning fishermen , there is some attempt to compromise within the proposals before us . #% It is a mistake for the Commission to propose that they should readjust the regulation to further exacerbate that particular problem . #% This can only happen if we seriously adjust the structures and procedures of the WTO . #% The ELDR believes that the Union and the international community must maintain pressure on Mr Milosevic and must be prepared , if necessary , to back this with the credible certainty of military intervention . #% Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each Member State . #% They make no secret of the fact that this Constitution is not an end in itself , but a work in progress and they do nothing to conceal their ambition to have it , in their terms , strengthened at the first opportunity -- without , of course , the troublesome obstacle of further national consultation . #% May I say in conclusion that since May of this year the European Parliament has the power of codecision on all environmental matters as a result of the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty ? #% I am not sure what the implications for the industry would be if there was a system as she proposes , but I certainly will raise her concerns . #% The enthusiasm and determination of the candidate countries seeking to join the EU provide the clearest proof that the European Union is an enormous success story . #% How we voted on this also gave us a chance to have our say on some of the other aspects of the current economic climate , such as causes of the crisis , governance and financial market reform . #% The European Union does have an important political role to play in re-starting the peace process in the Middle East ; it could certainly be seen to play a role as an honest broker in the region . #% This is not a precautionary approach to fisheries management . #% It is interesting that in Brussels airport , at the moment , they are constructing a totally new duty-free shop in the middle of the airport . #% This means that anyone supporting this principle must abide by its decisions , including the use of veto . #% My last point is that , when we speak about consumers , let us ensure that we speak about all of the consumers of Europe not just those in the largest urban areas . #% I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members . #% My work in the area of children and children 's rights clearly indicates that this is an important and very vital extension of the role Mr Söderman has been fulfilling so splendidly . #% They are entitled to look to our institutions to protect their jobs . #% In modern life , chemicals play an essential role in the economy . #% Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work that has been carried out on this very difficult matter . #% In many cases it is a whole family transaction . #% National allocations will have to be linearly convergent with the Kyoto Protocol . #% Congratulations to our two rapporteurs , firstly Mrs Read , who has always been a doughty supporter of telecommunications . #% Indeed , climate change will require increased investment in the public sector . #% . Europe 's transport system is expected to see an increase of road freight by 2013 of more than 60 % . #% The most recent statistics on energy intensity show that for 1996 we are at level zero . #% Perhaps we could have an answer before the end of the debate . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of the House the problems faced by the rendering industry in the United Kingdom as a result of European Union legislation setting standards for incineration plants in the United Kingdom , namely the Waste Incineration Directive , which is now due to be implemented by the end of this year . #% Therefore some role must be found for Parliament in the interactions between the social partners . #% She says : ` How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria , China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq ? ' #% How can we describe the bombing of Qana except as a war crime ? #% We propose that the hearings should be tough because we have learned from the lessons of the past five years that it is better to be tough at the outset than to regret it later . #% The bottom line is simply this : I believe that the Union and the USA should work together to preserve our common interests , to minimise our collective differences , to maximise our own influence for good in the world . #% Tomorrow , when we vote on the college , the ELDR group will vote for a college and we will not seek at this point to differentiate , to pick or to choose between nominees . #% Medical practitioners in this area consequently predict that there will be a steady rise in the frequency of asbestos-linked cancers until the year 2020 . #% We should be a beacon of hope and tranquillity for those who wish to have their viewpoint heard . #% We have decided to change our rules to make it clear to everyone that we will monitor expenditure in every spending committee . #% . -- Mr President , what continues in Burma is appalling . #% Mr President , I supported the amendments to the Müller report , though every fibre of my being wanted to deliver a body blow to Dr Rath - spelled r-a-t ? - and his minions , who have placed this Parliament under siege not just for the past few months , but for a year . #% If you were to have a request from the UK Government to reinstate that ECU 175 million to use to solve the crisis and help the workers in the industry , would you be prepared to look at that favourably and would you be prepared to released those monies to the UK ? #% I believe that policy is much better than the one of ` do n't vaccinate but rather burn ' . #% When the opportunity for peace arises , we must seize it as it passes . #% It is one of the few areas in which I have noticed that all political groups in this House had very little difference at the end of the day , and certainly our mission was exactly the same . #% How best to sell the message that the European Union is a positive force for the people of Europe will be a central challenge for the participants of this Convention . #% The European Community and the Member States wanted to forward an extensive list to be considered if possible before the first COP next week , but in any case in time for examination by the first meeting of the POPs review committee . #% 
In the rush to secure a WTO deal , I trust that this basic obligation is not being either jeopardised or compromised . #% But first , before that can happen , we must ensure that the intellectual property rights and patenting rights are protected to allow for innovation to take place , to allow for investments to be made . #% The PSE voting list tomorrow will reflect our desire not only to see the opening-up of a consumer credit market in this area but also to achieve the highest possible level of consumer protection for consumers right across Europe . #% Does he agree with her statement last week that if we accepted the G20 proposals in their entirety we would lose up to half a million jobs in the supply chain , with beef production in the likes of Ireland and France being wiped out and poultry production disappearing altogether ? #% However we believe it is premature in the debate to take a fixed position on the future options for designating European Assisted Areas . #% It is quite clear that if this industry keeps growing as it is , it will soon outstrip the supply of resources from industrial fishing . #% It would be very difficult for those who propose a ` yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission . #% Furthermore , we should get it into our heads that we are not running economies , we are running states . #% Where the Pirker text puts the case for enforcement penalties for trafficking , pushing and consumption of synthetic drugs , the Greens seek to delete the reference to consumption . #% We should oppose it at every opportunity rather than saying : just keep us informed about it . #% So what more have we to do ? #% I must confess a conflict of interest at the start . #% We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter , more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect . #% Companies and consumers are finding it difficult to gauge whether their prospects are good or bad . #% The focus should be accountability and democracy , but Nice was a shambles with the outcome for Ireland that we lose our automatic right to a Commissioner . #% My second point is that , in addition to the evident problem of slow manufacturing processes , it appears unlikely that there will be enough flu shots available for all those who might need them . #% There was a time when we had a limit of 1.1 % . #% The theory is good , but the practice has been awful and has not matched the theory at all . #% In this respect , the role which the market can play is particularly important . #% It is vitally important to preserve the political legitimacy of the Commission in all Member States and in the eyes of each national electorate . #% Are we to have an army of inspectors looking over the shoulders of self-employed workers to see if they are performing general administrative duties or administration relating to the job under way ? #% The people who murdered him should be obliged to face judgment in the courts and to serve their sentences in prison . #% The experience of the last six months suggests that there is a strong case for preserving the present system of rotating the Council presidency . #% So an initiative like this will be virtually meaningless unless the Commission is able to persuade the Irish authorities to reduce the vehicle registration tax . #% Therefore , I wish to put on record now what I was trying to propose . #% But the problem is that the national authorities will not come forward with any sincere proposals to help the fishermen in the region . #% Mr President , I -- like most of the other speakers -- would like to concentrate on natural optical radiation , or sunlight . #% That is the major reservation that I have about what we are proposing here tonight . #% The St Malo Summit concluded that the EU needed , and I quote , ` strengthened armed forces that can react rapidly to the new risks and which are supported by a strong and competitive European defence industry and technology ' . #% Given the circumstances at the time -- the Iron Curtain , the cold war and the military polarisation between East and West -- few other than de Gaulle could have believed that would happen . #% Many Irish workers would see that they are in that position at the moment . #% In Ireland the Commission is regarded as an honest broker - someone who can always help when there are delicate textual and substantial political issues to be considered . #% I expect the Commission to give careful consideration to effect our positions on the strategy papers . #% Mr President , I also want to address a rigid Commission policy . #% No more parachuting into important Commission staff positions . #% It is therefore appropriate that we should continue to monitor developments which could in any way undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong and threaten fundamental freedoms . #% Therefore , if this Charter were to be incorporated into the Treaties , it would supersede the European Convention on Human Rights , it would supersede any national constitutional provisions and would also supersede any national legislative provisions . #% The intention of the proposal was to create minimum harmonisation of a statutory provision within individual Member States concerning the need for legal guarantees , all of which Mr Whitehead so eloquently referred to . #% Having worked so hard to create this powerful federal monetary capacity , we must not dissipate its international effect by an absence of vision and will . #% Madam President , given the degree to which the media has had access to an unpublished report commissioned by the EU 's Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Committee , STOA , entitled `` The Possible Toxic Effects from Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague '' , could you immediately organise for the publication of this report to ensure a balanced and informed comment by all , especially by us in this Parliament of democratically elected representatives ? #% author . - Thank you , Commissioner , for dealing with this question . #% Every country should support the telephone helpline for children . #% The Liberal Group will support the core of this proposal because it is the real issue . #% In that regard , with the Council and the Commission present , I wish to make a number of political points . #% One of the ways in which we can help to revive our economies is to ensure that the present deadlock in trade negotiations is broken . #% From an Irish perspective , any future EU Treaty that appears to supersede the Irish Constitution will be extremely difficult - if not impossible - to sell to the Irish people . #% In conclusion I would like to reiterate the importance of the many roles of the Ombudsman and to wish him well in his duties . #% I think the very least we could do is have a study carried out so that we would base our decision on facts as they affect the citizen of the Union . #% This is about choice . #% I pass this piece of advice to you , Commissioner : if you want to smoothly facilitate free and easy movement of services throughout our 25 countries , I would n't start from here . #% I ask you particularly to look at the seventh EU framework programme and to deliver as best you can . #% This motion follows previous resolutions and strongly worded paragraphs of the annual report on human rights produced by Parliament last year . #% Like many other huge vessels - in fact it is worse than other vessels because it is one of the largest there is - it goes to developing countries , acting as if it had some right to exploit the resources of other countries without any checks . #% However , I want to point out that in voting for the agreement and for the joint resolution , this is what the agreement says we are voting for : ' All participants to the agreement accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organizations ' . #% ( Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on the Irish presidency . #% Is that promoting foreign relations ? #% Commissioner , I appeal to you again to have another look at your proposals , come back and be mindful of the people that you represent . #% Mr President , behaviour which is apparently irrational usually has an explanation . #% The Commissioner mentioned three important points , one of which is access to third countries . #% The Ombudsman 's office is a direct link between the citizen and Europe ; it enables citizens to make known their concerns about maladministration at European level . #% Finally , the lesson to be learned from this is that in the future we in Parliament have to cooperate with the European Commission to ensure that national governments do not , as in the past , interfere in their responsibilities , and that when the Commission takes national governments to task , it can rely on our support . #% We live in an internal market and there must be solidarity between the Member States and the European Union in the event of energy supply problems . #% The EU ' s history has shown that localised overloading of environmental carrying capacity can be a temporary phase of an emerging economy . #% I am satisfied that the EU is committed to safeguarding the interests of its farmers and in this regard I believe that Commissioner Fischler has shown credible leadership . #% Any assistance that Europe can offer to kick-start the industry is very positive . #% We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event . #% 
That is why Serbia must not be ignored . #% This resolution calls for the Commission to analyse options for such a tax and sends a clear signal that Europe will push for a global agreement to deliver on the public 's demand for action . #% We need good internal links between our major urban centres , and we need good links to our major ports so that our goods can be shipped out effectively and efficiently . #% Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this truly historic day for Ireland . #% Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental . #% Finally , can I say that over the past 24 hours I have asked the services of the House to conduct , on my behalf , their own investigation into this question of documentation at a committee meeting earlier this week . #% The economic progress seen over recent years in the EU-15 Member States that enjoyed cohesion funding represents something of a model for what we can do when EU resources are properly targeted and implemented . #% Any charter of rights , any constitution will tell you , that all people are borne equal , yet every single day disabled people in the European Union are treated as unequal . #% I would commend to the House an examination of the Irish Government 's programme on local development which is an effort to redistribute some of the wealth in such a way that it helps the poorest urban and rural communities . #% While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position , I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit . #% Does she agree that there is a need for greater coordination between national policies and those designed to achieve rural development objectives and that there should be more concentration on decentralisation and the creation of new employment opportunities in the regions ? #% We know that the key brake on this expansion is the lack of confidence , particularly amongst consumers . #% I would like , in supporting Mrs Mouskouri 's report and congratulating her on it , to say : let us say it for the small books ; let us say it for the little , special minority language books ; let us say it for those who still enjoy the pure and absolute pleasures of a good book . #% Is it implementation , or is it a delegated act - in which case it is legislation ? #% But let us ensure that the debate is based on fact , truth and the written text and not on misconceptions . #% Yes , Kyoto has flaws , but only through working together can these shortcomings be ironed out to the benefit of all . #% That is exactly what this Parliament does not want . #% While only around 10 % of the world ' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa , 70 % of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there . #% For these reasons Members of the EPLP have voted against the Fiori report . #% European and Irish waste policies have to be based on a hierarchy of options , with prevention the most desirable and disposal the least desirable . #% The two sides have to be kept apart , but the normal constraints of morality , self-discipline and the rule of law have been drowned in a seething reservoir of hatred and revenge . #% Basically , what I am saying is this : we need to tackle this issue head-on . #% All legal advice tells us that they will find in favour of Article 175 as the legal base . #% In relation to the institutional care of adults with handicaps , I visited an institution where 450 people were living in awful conditions , unacceptable to us here in the European Union . #% These costs -- or more correctly these potential savings -- must be taken into account when considering the cost of a ban on cadmium batteries . #% In July of this year , the IRA called on its units to dump their arms and today we have verification that those words have been translated into action . #% How one judges the conference is a matter of opinion . #% Too much blame is now being levelled at agriculture for this apparent failure of the talks . #% You have to make reality the codes of conduct which have appeared very late . #% There were many diverse reasons for their ` no ' vote . #% In most countries of the Union - by way of contrast with the strategic petroleum reserve in America - security stocks are held by oil companies and are mixed with their operational stocks . #% I call on the Commission to immediately initiate an examination of all activities on the Cumbria site and ask the Commissioner to give assurance to that effect in his reply . #% What we do must not dilute the credibility of CITES itself . #% There needs to be some common sense in the way we deal with public services like the postal services . #% in writing . - As a representative from a region , Northern Ireland , where Sinn Fein , affiliates of a terrorist organisation which recently murdered a young man , Paul Quinn , has been admitted to government in a coalition with exclusively democratic parties , I was encouraged to note and vote for Amendment 14 which was in the following terms : #% That is constantly undermining what is unique not only about Europe as a continent but also about the individual Member States . #% I just do not understand this . #% The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading . #% Mr President , I want to remove the second part of the amendment because apparently a lot of people would support the first part , but not the second part . #% in writing . - I do not support paragraph 29 as it calls for the introduction of CCCTB . #% On 12 September 2005 , Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing on Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam , as has been pointed out by previous speakers . #% I just want to say , as somebody who comes from a peripheral area of the west of Ireland , that the European rural model is seriously endangered by the various enactments of the European Union in many cases , especially in the reform of the common agricultural policy . #% Would it be in violation of our obligations under GATT ? #% European agriculture will always remain critical to the well-being of European rural economies - indeed , it represents the main option for economic activity . #% I also contacted the journalist involved yesterday and I told him that there were inaccuracies and I followed it up with a letter of which you can have a copy . #% Such a slur on our interinstitutional relationship must not be allowed to stand . #% To address underdevelopment , the developed world needs to vigorously fight tax havens and illicit capital flows which deprive developing countries of resources they desperately need . #% I want to ask him : Is it the intention of the Council to agree to the final statement on the association agreement when it arises in October or November ? #% Mr President , like Mr De Rossa I also question the fact of the amendments being in order . #% The UN is the accepted custodian of international law , with unique structures and processes to uphold it . #% The full extent of the EUROPOL convention can not be enforced unless this procedure is completed and it is a poor example to the applicant states if we ourselves can not complete the ratification process . #% The situation is now out of control and even though the British Agriculture Minister is insisting there is no crisis , the whole of the EU views with alarm what is happening in the UK . #% Lack of clean water , lack of sanitation , lack of essential drugs , the cost of essential drugs , drug resistance issues , ineffective pesticides and drugs , drug toxicity , but above all , the main cause is the lack of political will in the developed world to do something about it . #% At the same time existing Member States will have to prepare the way for the accession of up to 10 or even 15 new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe . #% If we do not get our amendment through , we will face a huge problem next year in the budget and there will be cuts across all of the budget lines in agriculture . #% We have obviously achieved this . #% The draft Treaty will form a basis for the final EU Treaty which will be put in place at the IGC in the near future . #% Mr President , in recent days my small country of Northern Ireland has lost its most prodigious sporting talent ever . #% I believe this is lawnmower harmonisation at its best , where everything is chopped down to the lowest common denominator . #% It is about the specific social , economic and environmental problems of the entire small inshore fishing sector in all Member States of the European Union . #% Obviously , the new job opportunities that are going to be created in the future will be based very much on technology . #% This is essential if we are all to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol . #% The President of this Parliament , Mr Cox , actually attended one of these meetings in Sweden a couple of years ago . #% In fact one of the great threats to the continuity of agriculture is the fact that our farmers are getting older and older . #% It will allow more business to operate on the new e-economy , and will also get rid of some of the uncertainty and some of the difficulties there are with regard to the different domains that exist at present . #% Forty-four are children while 23 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are detained in retaliation for the capture of Gilad Shalit . #% 
They have not been here , and I think they must bear the shame for it . #% The only thing I want to say to the Commissioner is , could he please tell us which advice he is taking ? #% This is going to become a big problem and must be addressed . #% Following on from that , domestic workers should be in a stronger position to exercise their rights . #% A package of integrated financial measures needs to be deployed in order to press ahead with implementation of the network . #% I have to say to you , Commissioner , that we are here for the next five years . #% We in the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission can not renege on our responsibility here . #% Therefore , now that the trial has come to a conclusion , it is very important , Mr President , that you , on behalf of the Members of this House , intervene on their behalf - as the British Government is doing in many cases where its own citizens are in difficulties . #% When I raise the problem of the Commission coming forward with concrete proposals - be it set-aside or support mechanisms - the Commission says : '' let the national authorities come forward with ideas and we will take them on board in a very positive way . '' #% Safer travel for air passengers in Europe must at all times be the ultimate objective for EU governments and EU airlines . #% The Prestige disaster highlighted the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation and the lack of a sufficient EU response mechanism , which aggravated the environmental impact . #% We need to clamp down on sexual exploitation of children . #% Under the Irish presidency , Minister Roche set up a working group in the Council to look for better ways in which to inform citizens of the benefits of Europe . #% In effect , I feel an EU logo would be meaningless , a waste of time and money and I feel the same way about the EU logo for organic produce . #% I think that is quite significant . #% Who would like to have their baby delivered by a doctor , a junior obstetrician after being on duty for 70 hours ? #% In so far as you have dealt with the issue in broad transatlantic terms , my group welcomes strongly that emphasis . #% One problem that I have about it is that there is a natural tendency to concentrate much more on the 4 % of the budget that might have been lost , or the 2 % that probably was lost , than the 98 % of the budget that was properly spent . #% The savage experience of British citizens abroad confirms my view that we have much to lose from criminal justice integration . #% It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States , faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to , show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China 's human rights record . #% The UK , for example , has quite rightly conducted its own debate on stem cell research and come to the conclusion that a tightly regulated research programme can eventually bring benefits to sufferers of highly disabling and painful conditions . #% We have also seen the success of the internal market in terms of net job creation . #% Mr President , the main focus of the report is on the benefit of nanoscience and nanotechnologies and the need for Europe to be at the forefront of their development , in line with the Lisbon objectives of greater productivity and economic growth . #% Mr President , on behalf of my colleagues I wish to state that we voted in favour of this resolution on the WTO on the understanding that the reference in paragraph 6 to the CAP reform relates to the 2003 CAP reforms under Commissioner Fischler . #% If Mr Markov had lived in Northern Ireland he would not have come out with the rubbish he spoke tonight to try to justify the cause of provisional IRA/Sinn Féin , who are sitting behind him . #% Secondly , I welcome the commitment by the Egyptian authorities to start an investigation into what happened on 30 December . #% I welcome the fact that we will participate but we participate as equals and not merely as observers . #% The strictest possible criteria to reduce noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved however by using performance criteria and not design criteria which is commercially sponsored and fast-track in anti-competitive legislation . #% As the Commissioner knows , there are regions which are not capable of taking down this funding , and obviously that imbalance will create uneven European development . #% It is a matter for all democrats -- both in Spain and in Europe -- to back the Spanish Government in taking the process forward , because if we allow organisations like ETA or the IRA to see a gap between democrats as to how peace can be built , then we will fail and they will win . #% Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly . #% We have just voted in the Committee on Regional Policy on my report on the implementation of funds in the UK , and we are very much aware that employment rates are higher in the UK . #% He said he would come back to Parliament when the Commission had taken a decision . #% I can confirm in the several months that I have had the privilege of leading my own group the courtesy which you have shown to me - which I acknowledge here today - and also confirm the extraordinary openness with which you do your business . #% We need a balance here in protecting the consumer from the lender and the lender from the consumer . #% Consequently , a competitive market between air transport operators is necessary for Ireland 's economic competitiveness . #% With regard to the various amendments that we have received , on Amendment No 1 I will be looking tomorrow for a split vote . #% Could you indicate to me when you expect this regulation to become effective ? #% 1 January 2002 , which is not far away , is the key date for the circulation of euro notes and coins within the territories of all the EMU participating countries . #% We certainly need action , because the disease travels extremely fast and we have to be able to vaccinate outside affected areas . #% But is simply not true to state that the board of a company faced with a hostile takeover can not take action or is obliged to remain neutral or passive . #% We managed to find 2 billion extra when the beef industry got into trouble even though the pig meat sector is twice as big - there is twice as much pigmeat consumed in the European Union as there is beef . #% We must try to engage with people , so that we can open their minds and our own to what underlies their hopelessness . #% Of course we want to ensure by the year 2002 that the countries that suffered most when the common fisheries policy was put in place in 1983 will in future receive a fair and equitable share of the resources . #% It is not possible to separate the administrative element of taxation powers , including mutual assistance provisions , from the tax raising prerogative and this should remain subject to unanimous voting . #% We must address that . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I want to note the elements of agreement and disagreement with the emphasis placed by Mr Metten in his analysis . #% This resolution calls for a targeted and coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women , as stated in the EU Roadmap for Equality between women and men . #% Could you confirm whether it is true that Eurostat will be producing new figures in the next couple of days providing the economic indicators for 1996-1997 ? #% We were disappointed therefore when the Caudron report , voted recently , provided public funding for research in conflict with these guidelines against the constitutional position of my country and three other Member States . #% I believe that the European Parliament is uniquely placed to overcome the constraints of national positions and to provide policy coherence in areas where Community-level action is required . #% That is precisely why we believe in principle what we are doing today is a virtual abdication of parliamentary rights of review . #% We can not expect a country like the Comoros to know what fish has been taken out . #% Madam President , we spent a full day yesterday discussing the impact of BSE on public health and the serious consequences for our farmers , the food industry and employment , and we are , of course , also conscious of the consequences for our competitive position in world trade . #% We might still be in a legal quagmire unless we have a proper interinstitutional agreement . #% I came to vote today with my colleagues in the ELDR . #% It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that ? #% Malta 's other important cash income activity is tourism , which also depends on EU markets for its survival . #% There is no other way in which we can achieve that cooperation in the longer term . #% However , friendship does not mean blindness but the willingness to be honest . #% Mr President , I seek your assistance on the matter of allowances paid to Members of Parliament and staff of Parliament who do languages courses . #% I can assure all Members of this House that we in Ireland will vigorously pursue every political , legal and diplomatic option open to us to force the British government to close the Sellafield nuclear plant . #% Madam President , I do not want to criticise but to praise the people who put together this quite extraordinary building . #% Equality legislation alone will not succeed in tackling the deep-rooted inequalities that exist without the political will of politicians , of policymakers and others to grasp the nettle and comprehensively tackle discrimination . #% We do not want to be prescriptive . #% I support him entirely in his approach and I thank him for it . #% 
We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States . #% As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever . #% I can not say whether the advent of the single market has contributed to lack of control in these particular areas , but I can say that , with the benefit of hindsight , we need to look at how we can strengthen controls in this particular area . #% I warmly support you . #% We know that recent Treaties , including the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties , have imperfections . #% In terms of accountability , has the Commission sought a report from Europol on its apparent failure in detecting and impeding the progress of three international terrorists who fled as fugitives from justice in Colombia , before publicly appearing last month within the European Union , in Dublin ? #% Beyond the visible and immediate effects on children , the World Health Organization 's scientists concluded that radioactivity has a range of effects on health , including higher rates of cancers and heart disease . #% A possible solution , following a comprehensive impact assessment , would appear to be incorporation of aviation into a reviewed existing ETS , with the proviso that all flights landing and taking off in Europe must be included . #% I welcome Mr Oostlander 's report and hope that this House will take seriously the need to be ruthless in tracking down the members of these drug cartels . #% In particular , I welcome the agreement that was reached on structured cooperation on defence and the positive signals emerging relating to the creation of an EU Foreign Minister and one Commissioner with full voting rights per Member State , and also the budgetary powers of Parliament . #% We need to ensure that health and safety regulations are strictly enforced . #% It should also underline the importance of positive measures to assist developing countries to develop their institutional capacity to monitor compliance with core labour standards and to increase the educational opportunities available to children . ' #% There are many oppressive regimes , such as Turkey and Indonesia , which could take advantage of this . #% Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms . #% Ways of strengthening the entrepreneurial , technical and vocational dimensions of second level curriculum must also receive particular attention in the context of assisting SMEs in the future . #% The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments . #% I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland , and that is Raytheon . #% The Chinese have the advantage of cheap labour and sometimes , by our standards , questionable labour standards . #% As it is not a ban , we should be able to vote on it . #% We do not have the right to stop the reunification of Europe to correct the mistakes of history . #% May I say , first of all , that there is no proposal before the Council from the Commission . #% We have to reassure European farmers and say to them there are regulations in place , those regulations grant entitlements to European farmers and there is no possibility whatever happens that those obligations can be denied by the European Union . #% We stand on the threshold of realizing a shared strategic political goal in the form of launching EMU . #% in writing . - I am disappointed by the voting on this resolution . #% The badger-spread disease was first discovered on the day he was due to leave on a two-week holiday last June , and he has since lost 64 of his 82-strong herd . #% Furthermore , I would very strongly support a suggestion to publish a document outlining , on the one hand , what is already in place in the existing Treaties and , on the other , outlining what is new , changed or different . #% We should also have a bit of leeway within Parliament : for opening remarks in a Member 's maiden speech or for other important occasions during the Presidency , people should be allowed to use their own language , even though it may not be an official working language , on condition that they give a translation to the services before they make their speech . #% The mutual recognition of travel documents is paramount to implementing EU policy on the admission of third country nationals . #% I support Parliament 's view in insisting on maintaining its existing powers over the budget . #% Research and innovation are central to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , so investment in R&D is the best possible response . #% I would call on the Irish Minister for Justice to do just that , because trafficking is a terrible abuse . #% It is a channel providing important opportunities for communicating the key values underlying Europe 's rich cultural heritage and it must therefore be supported in every possible way . #% We must have a proper mechanism in place to ensure that , if a national court is not able or willing to bring a case against somebody who is accused of crimes against humanity , then there must be an international forum to do so . #% Finally , the European Union 's and the Member States ' policies must give greater attention to maintaining a healthy democratic division between urban and rural areas . #% If we did not know that , why would we ban it ? #% With regard to the amendment asking for temporary MRLs to be set at the lowest level of those suggested , it was not voted on in committee because it was supposed to be included in the compromise . #% Each of the European institutions must take on its responsibility to get the message across to our WTO partners regarding the EU offer which remains on the table . #% More encouragement should be given to farming families to develop small and medium-sized enterprises on their holdings . #% I also believe that the WTO is the best structure to open up competition in the industrial services and trading sectors . #% You can not have one without the other and when we speak about raising taxes , you can have the highest taxes in the world , but if you do not have companies employing people and paying taxes , then you can not provide social protection afterwards . #% It wants a specific directive on clearing , on the one hand , and settlement on the other , laying down common rules on authorisations , supervision and a common framework amongst others . #% Everybody believes that everybody else has a better deal . #% For me , integration depends on our success in fusing the agricultural economies of candidate countries with existing Member States in a manner that causes least disruption to both and in time provides for their full participation in the common agricultural policy . #% Will the Council undertake to keep the decision on the review and request the Commission to ensure that airports in Objective I areas and Objective I areas in transition are not penalised by the loss of revenue resulting from the ending of duty-free , which inevitably leads to higher prices for consumers , loss of earnings for airlines , shipping companies , ports and airports , and threatens employment for the industries and small firms which have supplied a range of goods to duty-free shops ? #% We had a very good example where your colleague , Commissioner Vivien Reding , Commissioner for Information and Media , took a very tough stand with the mobile phone companies - and we can see the result to the benefit of the consumer . #% Mr President , today is the 46th anniversary of the Tibetan national uprising of 1959 and this year the Chinese Government is marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region . #% This did not commence with the present structural funds programme because there was a delay in getting it off the ground , particularly in Ireland . #% Mrs Aelvoet has dealt with the issue of the date . #% Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble ? #% Given the value of this work , it is inexplicable that he should have been treated so aggressively by the Philippine authorities . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner to continue with her annual reports but to come to us on a regular basis so that we can help her improve utilization by putting pressure on the Member States , so that we can take swift action when bottlenecks and obstacles occur . #% If the Commission is being consistent in wanting to have a more ecological and sustainable approach to fishing , then surely it should not do that . #% Let us get right rather than get it early . #% No doubt there will be an appeal , but I support that for those countries for which it is relevant . #% However , increased bioenergy production would provide a very positive boost to the farming community , and I believe investment in small-scale biofuel projects within the primary agricultural sector would be extremely beneficial . #% On the contrary , it may be observed that there is a clear relationship between the quality of the environment and the wealth of a nation . #% There are many more untapped possibilities . #% in writing . - I voted against this resolution , which states the position of the European Parliament ahead of the initialling of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , because the conservative majority in this House refused to raise the need for basic safeguards for our citizens vis-à-vis this global copyright agreement . #% Is it not outrageous that a regime led by what can only be described as a tyrant , along with his cronies , can carry on with the ruination of a country and its people with total impunity ? #% We were concerned last year - as were millions throughout the world - at the health and environmental consequences resulting from the testing in the South Pacific at Mururoa and most Members here will recall the public hearing held here in Parliament which dealt extensively with this issue of health and public safety . #% And last but not least , I would strongly request that smaller Member States should retain the right to appoint one Member to the European Commission . #% This is only one report of many that will deal with other issues such as the use of small amounts of mercury in the dental industry . #% That is why it is most important that we not only learn from the mistakes of the past but also ensure that we never repeat them . #% There are legitimate concerns , because sometimes sales below cost can be abused to squeeze out competitors by means of predatory pricing ; this does not help small business , nor does it help the consumer . #% I believe that the internal market will benefit most from a joint and coordinated approach by all three institutions to improving the entire regulatory cycle . #% Then perhaps , in a different form but with the emphasis on the same strategy , the HELIOS could be applied under a new name in the mainline programme which is to be announced by the Commission in the very near future as outlined by the Commissioner . #% 
I would refer you to those statistics - I am sure you know what they are , and we have to do better . #% The G20 ministers have to make a firm commitment to supporting decent work and prioritising job growth , alongside minimum income , social protection and training or re-training for those who do not have work . #% In late 2004 , there was one documented case of human-to-human transmission of the ` z ' strain of H5N1 . #% It is important for patients to have access to information on the medicine that they are taking but I feel that this type of advertising would undermine the doctor 's role as gatekeeper and may damage their responsibility to patients . #% I know what I am talking about in this regard . #% I want to thank Carmen Fraga for her report : a very comprehensive statement and advice to the Commission and Council on the whole business of marketing . #% Moreover , the Irish Greens have always argued that a neutral and impartial player should be brought in , like the United Nations . #% Madam President , I agree with the two former speakers that this is an annual report of the first rank and of the highest political order . #% This is a far cry from a scientific endorsement of increasing European fishing of octopus even if certain other fleets have reduced their effort . #% An important European value that we all , whether lay or religious , purport to share is that any experimentation on a human being should only be for their exclusive and direct benefit . #% Our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in Europe . #% With all of those rights comes a responsibility . #% That is something of concern to many people in my constituency . #% I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say this . #% I come from an area in Northern Ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be . #% While voluntary agreements play an important role with regard to the whole issue of air travel , EU institutions and EU governments must not be afraid to intervene and legislate on issues to promote and protect air passenger rights . #% I am glad also to hear what she had to say about the annual action programmes because we really do need to deliver on the letter that Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and Commissioner Michel sent to Mrs Morgantini and myself as rapporteur on the DCI , because in that letter it was clear that Parliament would decide for itself what structures it would set up and the programmes and strategy papers it would examine . #% I would hope that Britain will not be allowed to engage in sudden devaluations of the pound sterling . #% I share this concern with my colleagues , Mr De Rossa and Mr McCartin . #% We need to use the knowledge in better ways . #% I voted in favour of the Karamanou report . #% We find it very one-sided and a blatant demand for Morocco to give in to European demands regardless of what it wants . #% But the forensic clean-up and subsequent intimidation of witnesses and others outraged all of those who genuinely believe in justice , in truth , in the rule of law and democracy itself . #% I support a package of measures for our larger and busier airports covering aspects such as land-use planning and management , operational restrictions and a ban on the noisier Chapter 3 aircraft . #% One of the most important aspects of the social aspect of globalisation is education , because no matter how many trade issues you deal with or how many preferential trade deals you give to developing countries , the people in those countries will never be able to climb out of the pit of poverty to which so many of them are consigned unless they are given proper access to education and healthcare and an understanding of how systems operate . #% But we did achieve a deal on Article 9 : we forced the Commission and the Council to freeze the article and to have a group of company law experts to examine key issues , and to come back to Parliament in March 2002 . #% On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation can not and will not be provided . #% This is not the case at present . #% I wish to ask you Mr President to make contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu to make it clear that the EU is founded on respect for the right of free speech , the right to criticise one 's own government , a free press , and the right to peaceful protest , as fundamental to a democratic state . #% That is why it is important that we should support the general opinion , agreed by the Legal Affairs Committee and as proposed by Mrs Wallis , concerning those areas over which there has been some conflict , I take note of what Commissioner Byrne said recently in his speech about the other opportunities . #% Included in this plan must be a comprehensive and integrated proposal that deals with the issue of eliminating the use of landfill sites in Ireland in the medium to long term . #% The Royal Society in the United Kingdom pointed out that the so-called solution of deep geological burial has many uncertain points which need to be solved technically . #% I welcome the fact that we are building a worldwide alliance against terrorism , but I would argue very strongly that we also need to build a worldwide alliance against poverty , exploitation and oppression . #% Finally , let me record my opposition to the proposed minimum expenditure levels in the Commission 's proposal . #% It is also positive in that it considers the very important issue of animal welfare and the question of overcrowding in fish farms , and calls for some sort of stocking densities to be set . #% Europe 's motor and oil industries must be able to comply with clearly defined targets in any new legislation , to ensure that they can plan in confidence for the next generation of motor vehicles and invest in better refineries . #% Is it not shameful that large Member States like my own and Germany can not supply the number of people skilled in information technology ? #% New technology - in particular digital tachographs and individual smart cards for individual drivers on the tachograph - could be the best way to regulate the hours during which drivers are on the road and at work . #% However , some still see this as a specific sector rather than as a reflection of our society ' s failure to give opportunity for all . #% But the single market on its own is not enough . #% I did not hear that mentioned recently . #% I believe that the lack of cohesion in the regional application of the CFP must inevitably lead to a lack of confidence in the policy and in the Community institutions . #% Mr President , the main thrust of this directive is to set targets for the levels of ozone which will be permitted in ambient air within the European Union . #% Mr President , there is no justification under Euratom for allowing the Commission to extend the Euratom loan by EUR 2 billion , as proposed in November 2002 , bringing the loan up to EUR 6 billion altogether . #% We have to take responsibility for that . #% Mr President , as the House knows , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy was deeply divided over whether or not to ratify the third generation agreement with Pakistan . #% My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today . #% I would like to use the brief speaking time I have to highlight the plight of the too-soon forgotten victims of terrorism . #% Many countries are light-years ahead of the Community . #% These amendments allow EU funding for unethical use of existing embryonic stem cell lines created before 31 December 2003 . #% It is hypocritical to spend EU funds on prolonging the life of dangerous facilities . #% The role of legislators in this area is even greater as we in the EU and Member States can with consultation and partnership create a better and brighter future for sufferers , family and carers . #% The wider political roadmap is still there on paper and so we do not need to reinvent the wheel here . #% Mr President , this report takes on an even wider significance following the tragic events in Yugoslavia and Kosovo , right in the heart of Europe . #% While this is to be welcomed , it means very little for millions of people throughout the European Union . #% The budget for the European Commission to highlight the dangers of cigarette smoking is only EUR 6 million and this pales into insignificance when one looks at the staggering levels of money available to the tobacco lobby to put in place innovative pro-tobacco marketing and advertising campaigns . #% They are in fact complementary to one another and should form the basis of our strategy in this particular area . #% This Parliament obviously shares the Commission 's desire for greater efficiency , simplification and flexibility in the legislative domain , but can not allow this to happen at the expense of its own competences and of democracy itself . #% In my view the draft Treaty , which is to be presented to the December summit in Dublin , must give priority to issues of widespread concern , such as employment policy and the fight against crime . #% In fact , one of Malta 's stronger arguments for entry rests on the close affinities that exist between the island 's economies and the European Union . #% I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation . #% Of course they need one or two things done to them , but if we constantly complain , we will get nowhere . #% This will not go down well in the individual Member States . #% We must never allow a government to use the Commission as a retirement home for politicians past - to use a consumer term - their `` sell-by date '' or for a political pay-off for old pals or indeed to export a national embarrassment to Europe . #% In particular I welcome the fact that the Commission has recommended that the screening of Maltese legislation should begin as soon as possible , with a view to starting negotiations at the end of this year . #% We are attempting to raise the political temperature on this issue to increase the pressure on those who can , if the will exists , make things happen on the ground to protect people . #% 
Our committee will shortly be putting in place a mechanism to ensure that we monitor all spending programmes very closely . #% Some people may say it is not important but most people feel , as we know ourselves in terms of civil rights and terminology , that language really does matter in this area . #% My farmers in Northern Ireland are facing a reduction of EUR 60 million because of mapping . #% I would urge Commissioner Figeľ to put on the record tonight the Commission 's intention of doing so as soon as possible . #% The US President , Mr Bush , has already stated that he wants to renegotiate the Kyoto Accord . #% To reiterate , what is important is that , by adopting this directive , we are blocking the use of HFC-134a , which has a global warming potential 10 times higher than HFC 152a . #% This resolution uses strongly worded language and condemns a number of countries who are openly attempting to restrict and censor information over the web , referring to them as enemies of freedom of expression . #% We know that at least one third of emissions come from the transport sector . #% I am sure all our colleagues will share our great joy and pride in this unique honour paid to John Hume and to David Trimble . #% There is no longer any public health justification for imposing an absolute requirement for all donations to be non-remunerated . #% There is one thing about the Commission 's proposals which I would question : why all the emphasis on tonnage if we have a quota policy which is working ? #% At the end of the day whether it is realpolitik or empiricism that brings us to this conclusion , my group would appeal that each Member State would reflect on its own position and where possible would opt out from this particular policy . #% Mr President , after the rejections of the Constitution , the Prime Minister rightly said that profound questions now arose about the future of Europe . #% There are questions as to whether in fact the United Kingdom is in breach of EU regulations . #% We have been dealing with this dossier for over a year now and it was a way forward . #% Some Member States are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency , and I hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit . #% The Commissioner and Mr Hatzidakis said that regional disparities will become twice as great . #% Mr President , whether one accepts Mrs Lucas 's figure of 4.1 million jobs or the Association of European Airlines ' figure of 7.5 million jobs directly dependent on air transport , we must agree that the aviation industry contributes very significantly to European employment and growth . #% There has been a political push forward . #% But I wish I could agree with my colleague , Mr Schnellhardt , that the Commission should be left to get on with the job . #% Only the tonnage specified on the official prescription should be manufactured . #% Mr President , I welcome this measure . #% I welcome the Commission 's initiative in this area . #% Regional and cohesion policies can be successful if everyone works together - the Member States , the regions and the local authorities . #% However , I would put it to the Council that , particularly in the course of this Presidency , much of the credibility around that rhetoric has been undermined . #% Here is the position of the Official Genetic Interest Group in the UK : ' If a patent is granted on a product or therapy or pharmaceutical product which incorporates or relies upon knowledge of a gene sequence , the patent protection should not cover the sequence itself . #% I think particularly of two Ukrainian doctors who narrowly escaped death after exposing a government-licensed trade in human tissue obtained from aborted but living 20-week-old foetal babies . #% The situation in Ireland is even worse because of our high dependence on beef and sheep meat . #% I am hopeful and confident that the European Commission will now bring forward the necessary legislative proposals to ensure that passenger rights for the citizens of the European Union are greatly improved as a matter of urgency . #% We have asked direct questions and we should have direct answers before we go to vote . #% It seems sensible to simplify how we operate the funds . #% They find themselves more and more burdened in circumstances where it is seriously impeding their competitiveness . #% These organisations in fact pay for membership of EWL and they do not have permanent financial aid available to them . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I would like to begin by congratulating you and also by congratulating the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government on the excellent conduct of Ireland 's six-month presidency of the Union . #% Having to re-insure and re-register can be such hindrances . #% Obviously the grieving families wish the bodies to be returned home , but in certain cases -- not necessarily those I have just mentioned -- they were simply unable to afford to repatriate the bodies of their loved ones . #% Just to wave taxes as a threat , without matching them with grants for retrofitting older plants so that they can comply with acceptable emission standards , and without generally increasing investment in monitoring emissions , will not work . #% The system needs to be reformed , and in such a way that we can take a credible stand and show that we are not getting extra privileges that our own voters are not entitled to . #% Even the tidiest house needs a spring-clean . #% Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts . #% The two institutions will now agree to extend constructive dialogue and political cooperation , to improve the flow of information and to consult and inform Parliament on administrative reform within the Commission . #% As always , the rapporteur , Ms Auroi , has produced a good report for our Committee , and many of her proposed amendments are welcome improvements to the Commission text . #% Why does the Commission continue to disregard the calls from MEPs , Member State governments and the tourist industry and refuse to bring forward proposals to extend duty-free for a further ten years or until all indirect taxes have been harmonized ? #% Solidarity within the EU will be vital in securing equitably distributed supplies from outside our borders , through the completion of a competitive , integrated , internal energy market . #% It is still not too late for the Sinn Féin leadership to rectify this failure , provided it has the commitment to do so . #% I would remind this House that early in the 1990s the Commission initiated a report on Northern Ireland fisheries . #% This resolution emphasizes a high-profile case in the necessary fight by the international community to bring an end to the scourge of people committing human rights abuses with impunity , anywhere in the world . #% The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland . #% You mean more bureaucracy and red tape ; more paperwork for the farmer and more inspections , which is what they do not want . #% The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks . #% I have to say that I find the second part of conclusion 11 by Mr Scapagnini unacceptable , because it recommends additional help to nuclear power . #% There are now nine Council members around the transport table who are prepared to ask for a study . #% Enlargement in the right circumstances will guarantee the benefits of the Treaties for new members . #% At the end of a long process , may I thank once again our excellent rapporteur who has worked in a remarkable way , our shadows and everyone else involved . #% My Group will also , by way of amendment , be defending Parliament 's absolute right to express our opinion on the Commission 's updated opinion on Malta 's renewed application . #% I fully agree with this objective which will help prevent some of the overcrowding and environmental problems associated with big cities . #% In the interests of transparency and information to Members , we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella . #% But internally , within the borders of the European Union , there are continuing difficulties with regard to cooperation and coordination . #% Mr President , the two Commissioners will know that while there is a crisis in the agriculture industry in Wales , Scotland and England , there is catastrophe in the north of Ireland . #% To take the example of the Services Directive -- you say that you are committed to the European social model . #% This would have been unacceptable to us , unacceptable to the Irish Government and unacceptable to our farming community . #% This year we have heard in Ireland , as is obvious from the concern expressed by Irish colleagues here today , of the danger facing Father Brendan Forde , a Franciscan working in the small village of La Ùnion who has chosen to remain with his parishioners at considerable danger to his own life . #% In particular , in order to achieve a better social integration and greater social cohesion , this report urges Member States to create training opportunities specific to groups such as unemployed youth , ethnic minorities , vulnerable women and people with disabilities . #% Mr President , today 's debate is timely as the 50th Eurobarometer report which has just been published clearly shows that concerns about unemployment are only just higher than the citizens ' desire for action against drugs and crime . #% What is not so readily acknowledged is that it has also been a successful prosperity process . #% We should not claim that a single currency will resolve unemployment . #% 
Unfortunately the Council did not have the courage to make the difficult decisions which need to be made . #% The nuclear five blocked all agreement on even small moves on nuclear disarmament at the NPT Treaty Prepcom meeting in Geneva . #% A great proportion , though by no means all of them , are parentally abducted children . #% When we reform agriculture there will be changes in employment in rural areas . #% Ireland is a net importer and 75 % to 80 % of our packaging is imported . #% These ships are not capable of withstanding a terrorist attack , and they are not capable withstanding a fire . #% As far as my own group is concerned , we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage . #% Investigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise . #% I said that Northern Ireland had been sinned against , both by the United Kingdom Government and by the Commission , as well as by the Council of Ministers and Parliament . #% I also think that OLAF would be less frustrated when , after having proceeded and found situations serious enough to be passed on to Public Prosecutors at national level , it does not happen . #% How does the Commission evaluate , from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market , the situation within the European defence industry , where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk ? #% We got the worst of all worlds , in that the Union owned the fish , but the national governments had the job of policing them . #% Apart from that , it is not just the people of East Timor who are persecuted but the Indonesians themselves . #% Madam President , in the interest of a democratic and just European Union I ask the Council to respect the Irish people ' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice by immediately halting further ratification . #% UNICEF was in touch with the real needs of real children . #% As we know , doubts about the commitment of the IRA continued to exist , 10 years on . #% Article 6 of the same directive only requires cigarette manufacturers and importers to list the chemicals contained in cigarettes and to report on the toxicological data available to them to the Member States , who are then required to inform the Commission . #% As well as this , there is a clear link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement . #% There is a view that there should be separate rules for scrapie rather than the current mix of rules where the treatment of SRM in sheep depends on the BSE incidence in that particular country . #% This issue has come up under the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease review . #% The Vice-President , Mr Martin , enjoys the full confidence of the House and of the President to conduct our affairs this morning . #% I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the survivors of this tragedy for the loss of their spouses and their children . #% Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there . #% This is where the thorny question is raised of who shall be responsible for ensuring that the claims are valid . #% The European Parliament must make it clear that we will not give our assent to any accession unless and until there is fundamental institutional reform . #% Renewable energies present us with a paradox . #% It is essential that recognition , not only of third countries ' systems and procedures , but also of their continued compliance , be , for a substantial initial period of time , strictly monitored at European level , as such recognition will be global in nature . #% By that commitment to those areas we would begin to show that we are giving them a lifeline for some kind of a future and that they have not been forgotten . #% To this end , it is important that entrepreneurs in Ireland are fully informed on how to make best use of the Small Business Act . #% Whilst I voted in favour of the report , I must confess to having some disquiet with regard to two aspects contained within it . #% The Fischler proposals cast a great shadow over rural Europe to begin with , but at the end of the day we have to appreciate that the outcome , while not totally satisfactory , certainly is not disastrous by any means . #% I come here every month to table questions but they are never reached . #% We could learn from it and we could apply the best elements of it to Tempus III . #% That promise was never fulfilled . #% That would mean IEP 700 m per year being put into the protection of pension payments for people from the year 2025 onwards . #% Council even went one step further by increasing the TACs for hake by almost a third where the Commission had recommended a reduction . #% That is something that we should be considering seriously at European level . #% It is an abysmal record , compared to the United States and Japan . #% Their work is , in itself , an example of intergenerational support and needs socio-economic recognition , although not as a substitute to the development of quality care services . #% Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices . #% This is the moment to draw a line and say to the Court of Auditors - whom my group holds in very high esteem - that we have separate functions : they audit and we do the politics . #% We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years , in the light of whatever changes may take place . #% We need uniform measurement techniques across the EU , but we do not need common threshold values other than for nitrates and pesticides . #% Does that invitation extend to Turkey ? #% It is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions , a pro- and anti-US stance , or even a left versus right divide . #% The supplementary question that I want to put is this : would the Minister agree with me that it is an abstract term and that it refers to the knitting together in an interdependent way of the economies of the European Economic Union , so that it becomes very difficult for countries to withdraw , while at the same time recognizing that it is a voluntary organization and whoever wants to leave can do so ? #% Again , what seems to be forgotten in this whole discussion and debate is that in July this House gave its endorsement and its confidence to Mr Barroso . #% I emphasize , however , that it is not a question of diverting existing resources . #% Mr President , I am very happy to add my voice to those who support the concept of voluntary citizen participation in the work of community development . #% The Portuguese Presidency will organise a Social Affairs Council which we can engage with if we deliver a view . #% ... that there is talk of industrial action in the airports . #% Misuse of antibiotics in prophylactics or in therapy can never replace good management . #% As a nuclear-free country , Ireland is affected by the waste coming from continental Europe to be reprocessed at Britain 's Sellafield plant . #% We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency . #% There will be a 17 % increase in the number of tuna vessels , from 57 to 67 . #% Therefore , I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that this new seven-year Socrates programme is given proper funding of EUR 2 500m . #% They wanted a greater understanding and a greater knowledge of what Europe is . #% Now that the Charter of Fundamental rights has the same legal value as the treaties , I am confident that the charter , and especially , the right to good administration , will be at the heart of Mr Diamandouros ' work as Ombudsman . #% Decreasing the usage of cigarettes in the Union serves only a positive function in terms of protecting the health of all our citizens . #% As both the Gargani and Niebler amendments were defeated , the next amendment ( Committee ) was passed as I feared . #% Many people feel that these two differing groups can not be reconciled . #% It is our responsibility to ensure that it can not happen again . #% Racist incidents that have taken place at European football matches include the following acts : monkey-like chanting , derisive singing , the hanging of banners that reflect neo-fascist beliefs and the tossing of banana skins on to football pitches . #% Perhaps the shock of the Irish result will motivate those who a week or two ago were wondering whether this was necessary . #% Still there is no resolution of the problem at European Union level , still the Commission sits on the fence and speaks about the complexity of the issue . #% I welcome the directive on cross-border credit transfers which is now in force within the Union . #% 
I have absolutely no interest other than the convenience of Members . #% Many of these may not in fact be cases of parental abduction , but may be simply criminal abduction . #% In Europe we can not allow our food supply to be outsourced . #% Those people who try and tell us that we must put off this whole process and stop and listen to the voice of democracy are totally ignoring the voice of democracy as represented by the nine other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution . #% It is a very fundamental part of the contribution I made but because of all the noise in Parliament , it was lost on that occasion . #% The Council , however , instead of increasing recycling or environmentally sound recovery to meet the recovery target , insisted on putting incineration on an equal footing with recovery , contrary to the ECJ ruling . #% In its communications the Commission announces a number of short-term measures , the extrapolation of MRLs , and medium-term actions such as incentives for industry , more flexible rules for the use of products and the revision of the existing legal instruments . #% The United States has endorsed the Israeli position . #% In this crisis the European Commission must move immediately to reintroduce to Parliament and Council the draft directive on manning conditions for ferries , which this Parliament approved in its first stage in 1999 and which has since been blocked by the Council . #% I think that if we want to speak about real debate and real engagement then that debate and that engagement must be based upon facts , certainties , not the continuous misconception , myth and innuendo that have been cast about over the last 20 years . #% Climate-proofing and adaptation need to be mainstreamed across policy areas , especially those concerning water , soil , agriculture and fisheries , and coastal areas . #% Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market . #% This information was officially reaffirmed in a démarche to the Danish Presidency six weeks after we arrived in Pakistan . #% However , the key point that I want to refer to again is the issue of stricter national measures . #% Only towards the end of last year did the Commission negotiators come up with a compromise proposal . #% Mr President , it is difficult for any of us in this House to comprehend why one human being should kill another , and yet in Colombia members of guerrilla and paramilitary groups kill each other and thousands of civilians without qualms , and in some cases with relish . #% We know the European Union has already accepted natural monopolies in certain service areas such as gas , electricity and air traffic control to ensure fair access to all users in the single market . #% In Germany , believed by most people who work in this area to be the country where most of these difficulties exist , we have Mr Guy Foster and Mr Chris McMullen ; and probably one of the best-known cases of all , Lady Catherine Meyer , the wife of the British Ambassador in Washington , who has seen her two sons for precisely 24 hours in the past six years . #% If they do not meet the challenge I regret to say the alternative is too horrible to contemplate . #% in writing . - When this House considers budget priorities , it does so in the context of massive public sector cuts in EU Member States , rising unemployment , increasing household bills and overall economic uncertainty , both nationally and in many families . #% The people who are producing this cocaine and heroin , and causing such havoc in our cities and towns and the countryside , must be stopped . #% Perhaps the strongest contributing factor to the likelihood of current and future human rights abuses and war crimes is the fact that , in the past , persons of power have been allowed to act with impunity , with no fear of prosecution or trial under international law . #% Coming from Ireland I know that for far too long people spoke of the Northern Ireland conflict as a conflict between Catholics and Protestants , whereas in fact it was a much more nuanced thing than that and there were much more serious issues , including civil rights issues , at the heart of the problem . #% Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Pinheiro , I welcome this excellent report by Michel Rocard on a new cooperation agreement to replace Lomé 4 . #% Each Member State is trying to deal with the problem as best it can . #% The vast majority of reports we have just voted upon I can support and agree with . #% On that basis and according to what everyone else has said , I appeal to colleagues for support for the legal base of Article 175 tomorrow , with the proper Commission policing -- please -- of the internal market , as required of them under Article 176 . #% While I recognize that the problems of Corsica , Sardinia and some of the Greek islands are very specific , I would also like the Commission to recognize that there are small islands in my own country that could and should be considered for specific Community action . #% However , as I said , women work , and we must do our best to at least ensure that if someone other than the primary care-giver is taking care of the child below the age of two years nine months , that it is someone who can give the child as nurturing a care as possible . #% I also hope that a genuine and significant decision will be made in relation to the Turkish application for membership . #% At the same time , they have been given an impossible task to try and square a circle that can not be squared . #% I accept everything he has said and I understand the reasons why he said what he said . #% In fact this was leaked by an Islamabad-based diplomat for a Member State government , who was in Europe at the time , and was designed to undermine the work of the EU/EOM . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Taoiseach here for an honest discussion about the future of Europe , but , as I was once told when asking for directions , I would not start from here . #% As regards the wording and terminology , we did go to some considerable trouble when having the report translated to have the correct title in each language . #% I beg my fellow Members to help the Irish people and vote for that amendment . #% I would draw Members ' attention to Amendment No 7 where we lay down guidelines allowing non-hazardous waste and inert waste to be excluded from the scope of the directive . #% I would ask Members to be particularly careful not to undermine the confidence of Europe 's electorate by going over the top about scandals . #% Instead , the proposal would have resulted in discriminatory treatment between EU workers and non-EU employees posted to work in the EU . #% I have to say that I am disappointed that the coastal states did not reach an agreement in Oslo at the beginning of March . #% That is unfortunate because it is difficult to promote them as measures before we have some sort of evaluation . #% I presume this means he will reply in the normal way and within the normal period . #% For Europe to be at the forefront of a successful knowledge-based economy , we must move forward with new technologies and stay ahead in the knowledge race . #% In conclusion , we are only spending 1 % of the 1.2 % of GDP currently available . #% Mr President , I certainly join in welcoming this announcement . #% At present , there are 213 Irish troops among the KFOR force stationed in Kosovo . #% In my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development , which , as you said , Commissioner , unlocked the potential of rural areas . #% I , like many people , am very fond of it . #% I believe that great sensitivity , tolerance and compassion must be employed whenever it is proposed to employ the environmental standards of a developed economy to the economies and environments of emerging economies . #% One of the clearest memories I have of that time is the rush with which many of our European governments ran to press to claim that in some mysterious way the contamination had wondrously blown away from their countries and not polluted their countries , so that they could sell their radishes , lettuces and cabbages without anyone assuming - horror of horrors - that they had also been affected by the disaster of Chernobyl . #% Mr President , the report on safety at Sellafield , published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate , is a damning indictment of safety at the plant and falsification of safety checks there . #% Travel for Members of this House is difficult enough without bringing in new agencies , without consulting Members . #% The MRL regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992 , and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000 . #% We could use biomass to heat factories , schools and hospitals , if we so wished . #% Finally on the Florence process , we must involve the Parliament and we must have some democratic involvement in this process . #% We all want to find cures for illness and I am sure that in each of our families we have personally experienced the sadness of incurable disease . #% The euro is good news for European businesses . #% My understanding from the briefings I have received is that there is a requirement to have such ships dealt with within a period of 180 days . #% It is currently in receipt of monies to develop a new tramway system in Dublin and a tunnel to take freight from the north side of the city - the M50 in the airport area - to the docks , thus keeping unnecessary freight from the city 's streets . #% It is by embracing our cultural and linguistic diversity that we enhance the understanding of Europe , its diverse peoples and its many different regions . #% Mr President , there is something highly obnoxious about any trade in human body parts or tissue . #% 50 million live with epilepsy , over 80 % of them in the developing world ; 24 million live with schizophrenia ; 37 million live with dementia , mainly Alzheimer 's and , with an ageing population , this is increasing all the time . #% Without using all of my time , because we may all be tired and perhaps emotional , I shall just say , with regard to the developing world -- and I share the concerns of others here in the House -- that in reforming sugar we have upset the developing world , because we are offering it access to our markets at much reduced prices . #% It does seem a little bit strange since , at the core of the EU , we have the free movement of goods ; therefore we would end up , if we use CCCTB , by penalising exporting countries . #% Like previous speakers , I welcome it because it is time that we in the EU had our own domain . #% So NGOs are pulling their people out of Darfur while indiscriminate attacks continue on civilians . #% 
It is great that the public will actually have access to this information because lame excuses were used in the past for refusing it . #% For example , the complexity of transport flows offers some areas new opportunities yet other areas get congestion and pollution . #% Mr President , following the fall of the Milosevic regime on 1 October 2000 and the ensuing democratic changes which took place in Belgrade , the European Union has radically changed its policy towards Serbia . #% We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year , now we get a promise of a Green Paper . #% This is not the truth . #% It is not going to be possible to ensure the free and fast flow of goods and people around the continent , or indeed on the island of Ireland , unless we have fast , efficient , safe and comfortable rail services , not only to and from our major urban centres , but also to provide cohesion in those parts of our continent whether there is underdevelopment . #% For far too long the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights . #% We must learn from our hearings . #% I am dealing specifically with the employment aspects of the matter as opposed to compensatory aid . #% Open Recruitment and Portability of Grants , #% I do not mind what your views are on this issue . #% However , when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report , when we look at the disparate views - the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce - we sometimes forget that a lot of small - and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves , who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I , `` as an individual '' or anybody else , as an individual consumer , would have . #% I share the concerns expressed by the Irish presidency and others that the timescale proposed under Articles 5 to 9 of the directive are simply not achievable . #% This proposal has much merit and we will certainly look at it . #% This seems to me to be a grotesque situation and quite simply should not be tolerated by the European Union . #% Under what criteria do you meet people ? #% I urge the Irish Government to take action under the Convention to stop these shipments . #% We do not want continuous , ad hoc structures . #% Inshore fishery activities essentially maintain the social fabric of those communities . #% The directive should also contain mechanisms to discourage , as we have already heard , the Member States from their market distorting subsidies to traditional forms of energy , particularly fossil fuels and nuclear . #% I have no confidence that , without sustained international pressure at the highest possible level , Burma will make the positive transition to democracy . #% Without any doubt , this leaves domestic workers in a precarious position , and very often they have to rely on the goodwill of employers . #% It is eminently sensible to promote renewable energy because it enables us to fulfil our environmental objectives , creates jobs and ensures security of supply . #% Human rights are too important to be used as a bargaining chip in interinstitutional negotiations . #% In an ideal world I would expect that citizens would be protected from any risk of environmental damage -- and thankfully we are making progress in terms of some real preventative measures . #% I call on the Vietnamese authorities to release all political and religious prisoners and I am asking the government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the elections which will take place in July are free and fair . #% The greatest risk is that this opt-out is extended to all Member States which would render regulation of Working Time redundant , resulting in a race to the bottom . #% The rapporteur , like many of us , endorses the Commission 's recommendations and the action plan it has put forward . #% . -- Mr President , I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack . #% It is also important to tighten up the definition of `` self-employed '' . #% Bullyboy tactics of this sort are hardly the ingredients to build closer economic cooperation or coordination . #% I have two questions to put to the Commission . #% On my recent visit to Iraq I saw children die of respiratory infections , diarrhoea , leukaemia , gastro-enteritis and malnutrition . #% In the resolution before us today we call on the Chinese Government to abide by the moratorium adopted at international level . #% We know that when there is doubt about a particular measure , the European Parliament must apply the precautionary principle . #% The Spanish Presidency is now dealing with the most difficult enlargement negotiations , notably agriculture , the structural funds and budgetary matters . #% Secondly , the Commission must coordinate future and past research results relating to the disease and be prepared to coordinate with the World Health Organization associations and organizations active in this sector , including families and carers . #% New embryology is proving that adult and other post-natal stem cells have vast biomedical potential , as great or greater than embryonic stem cell potential , which is already being described as old embryology . #% Part of his question was to put down yet again a marker in the sand about the fact that the members of the European Parliament 's delegation , as part of the EU delegation , will be treated as second-class citizens . #% Therefore , because the constitution was a different constitution , it is not a precedent with regard to the issue of a competent authority to transmit such a request . #% There is real fear among workers of a race to the bottom in Europe . #% Targeted EU spending is one way in which we can boost local economies and bring jobs to our communities . #% Mr President , the final stage for the completion of a European single market relates to the introduction of economic and monetary union within the European Union . #% If the broader international investor community is to have maximum confidence in economic and monetary union within the EU , the EU must put its house in order . #% In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern . #% The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person 's health . #% This request is also being made on behalf of the other Members of the European Parliamentary Labour Party . #% Madam President , in 2001 , during the BSE and CJD scares and outbreaks , the Commission implemented a temporary ban on feed of animal and fish origin being fed to ruminants , pending thorough scientific risk assessment of the regulation . #% It can not be left to Member States , since there is a legal problem , I understand . #% There is now , however , a very strong case for regionalization in Ireland for the next round of Structural Fund monies . #% If they were in Brussels or in a city in the UK , they would probably pay only a quarter of that . #% What made it all the more noteworthy is that the LTTE 's chief spokesman , Mr Tamilchelvan , stated that this interim administration was not a precursor to a separate state . #% To this end , publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information , for example emergency phone contact numbers . #% I think 2007 as the Year of Equal Opportunities for All can become a platform for just that . #% Governments previously agreed in the secrecy of the Council to have a Services Directive , it was put together and then suddenly pressure was applied and they all backed off and said it must be changed . #% The reason why the European Union displayed such strong unity and solidarity in the wake of 11 September is because we appreciated that contribution , and value the strong transatlantic alliance . #% They have no vested interest in energy efficiency and that is clear from their stance . #% I draw your attention to Article 152 ( 5 ) which prevents Community action from affecting national provisions on the donation of blood . #% What Mrs Malone said is very true : recital E is actually misleading . #% Furthermore , what would or should be the role of the EU if a vital interest such as our energy supplies or our telecommunications links were threatened ? #% Mr Blair , you were right to say that we must modernise Europe 's social model on the basis of a strong economy and not at the expense of it . #% Mr President , there is no doubt that liberalisation of the transport market has delivered positive benefits for the mobility of goods and people , but this is in the context of a continuing predominance of road traffic , growing congestion and harmful effects on the environment and public health . #% Revenues from international roaming charges total about EUR 10 billion and regulation should save the consumer between 40 % and 60 % . #% However , Mozambique is Ireland 's biggest destination for development aid money and the reason is that the Irish Government works very closely with the Clinton Foundation in tackling disease , including AIDS , as well as giving education on the ground . #% One of the extraordinary things about fish is that while fisherman have been finding it difficult and jobs have been reduced , the price of fish , almost alone as a food product , has been increasing continually over the years to the consumer in Europe . #% The ultimate goal has to be sustainable fisheries through regional management , by opening up the governance of the common fisheries policy and helping to overcome mistrust and scepticism . #% 
I note that the Commission is proposing a review in 2005 but I would urge that you also ask the Member States to make annual reports on achieving the targets in the White Paper . #% At the same time we are not denying access of citizens to the brave new world of the information society and , in particular , to the more disadvantaged users and communities . #% They want to make sure that those rights are never taken away again . #% I endorse wholeheartedly the decision of the European summit to give its support to Yasser Arafat as the leader of the Palestinian people and I condemn without reservation the misuse of the Security Council veto in blocking the appointment of international observers to the Middle East conflict . #% Finally , I seek clarification from the Commission in relation to the proposed Objective 1 in transition status . #% I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so . #% This whole programme can be made more acceptable if this happens . #% The European Commission is to be applauded in its initiatives to date and its continuing work aimed at eliminating red tape for small businesses . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , the negotiations for the EU-Canada trade agreement have been driven by major European and Canadian multinationals who want market access to vital public services so that they can profit at the expense of workers and consumers . #% This is a graphic illustration . #% Some of them are working straight shifts of 36 and 37 hours without any rest period or sleep . #% It is undeniable that there are still marked disparities in existing Member States and I therefore support the proposal for transitional funding arrangements for Community aid in existing Objective 1 areas post-2006 . #% Knowing your personal commitment to fisheries , I know that you will not disappoint them . #% This is of particular importance in rural areas , where numbers are declining in the traditional activities of agriculture and fishing . #% I endorse the call set out in the Buzek report for the continuation of the INTAS programme and for its activities to be funded from the specific ` Cooperation ' , ` People ' and ` Capacities ' programmes . #% Having lost the vote on the common organisation of the market , I logically supported the other two reports -- on direct support schemes and the temporary restructuring of the sugar industry -- in order to secure the best possible deal for Irish , EU and ACP growers . #% Commissioner , if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives , including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear . #% There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up . #% Unless you understand that , you will weaken the Commission . #% In so doing , we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric . #% Countering terrorism is in large measure countering poverty . #% While that persists , we will persist with our call for the appointment of our own prosecutor , who can look after our own resources and be seen to do that . #% Average EU tariffs are now less than 4 % , while some industrial tariffs in Asia and South America are as high as 30 % . #% This framework must naturally take due account of national practices . #% As an example , the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions , but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again . #% I want to raise that matter with you now for the benefit of the other Members of this House who felt exactly the same way . #% Hard cases make bad law . #% Now it is unable to do so , after being destroyed by the actions of Robert Mugabe and his henchmen . #% Mr President , in view of the complete blockade in British ports for Irish beef , could I ask the Commission to make a statement to say what they intend to do about this very serious and deteriorating situation , which is an interruption of trade . #% They have not yet been charged and there is no evidence of any possible serious charges against them . #% Some believe that the impact assessments should be handed over to an external body . #% I would therefore urge Commissioner Flynn here tonight to come forward with a draft directive and I would urge Members to support the report and the amendments to which I have appended my name . #% Unless Europe takes courageous steps now and encourages the USA to do likewise , the situation could very quickly become irretrievable . #% The Irish presidency must concentrate on a sound framework for European research and innovation . #% Prime Minister Netanyahu must also be reminded that EU trade agreements require those we do business with to respect those rights . #% Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States . #% Does the Commissioner have this information on him now ? #% As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I was interested to see the work carried on there . #% In essence what this means is that the countries , including Latvia , Lithuania , Slovakia , Bulgaria , Romania and Malta , will now open negotiations on membership of the European Union in March of next year . #% Nobody wants to upset the Union at this moment or withdraw Northern Ireland from it without the consent of both traditions . #% If politics is the art of the possible let us now challenge ourselves to do better , to respond in a more positive and caring way to the helpless pleas of those destined to die of AIDS , disease and hunger . #% The aim is life-long learning ; to produce a new type of specialist graduate equipped with superior rural development , advisory and management skills . #% Finally , Florence will be remembered for the successful efforts of the Commission president and the Italian presidency in persuading the United Kingdom to lift its veto on the Union 's institutional democratic decisionmaking process . #% Mr President , the last enlargement brought a deeper interest and even a passion into the debate on forestry in this Community . #% The response of the governments around the world has also been good . #% Actions , not words alone , can cleanse the hands of those nations in Europe which have both armed and furthered the aims of terrorists and have then refused to extradite those criminals for proper trial . #% The SAVE initiative , which dates back to 1991 , is one of the cornerstones for the European Union policies to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 . #% I was the author of that particular amendment and I thank my colleagues for their support . #% There is one extremely important issue that must be tackled in the framework of the new cooperation agreements and that is the issue of arms sales . #% The Spanish government is dealing with one of the most difficult tasks - how to bring internal , politically driven violence to an end . #% If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising . #% If sometimes that means allowing for international adoptions , then that should be the case . #% That needs to be rectified very quickly . #% One of the most important issues to come out of the Convention discussions has been the reiteration of the doctrine of conferral . #% I would like to have had more certainty about the proposed role of the Court of Justice taking into account the role of the courts of the Member States . #% The fourth point concerns competitiveness . #% Finally , on the knowledge society , it is very clear that we need to convert our thinking , not just at a technological but also at a social level . #% While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported . #% Furthermore , according to the Treaties , any revision of the CAP will not take place before 2003 - 2004 . #% The UN report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the Tamil people . #% I believe we should be asking both sides in this conflict to have this courage and show their leadership . #% It is easy to build the structure of a building to house an institute of technology . #% Emissions from the developed world are the primary reason for global warming . #% Integration has succeeded in overcoming age-old differences between European countries . #% All security agencies in the EU countries , whether public or private , must fully cooperate one with the other in every way possible . #% EU funding should not be promoted for controversial research , banned in four Member States , my own country included . #% 
The EURATOM Treaty is 40 years old this year . #% People in our industrial , declining , peripheral and rural regions need to know that EMU will have some benefit for them . #% I therefore urge Ireland 's Minister of Finances not to renege on his promises to increase spending , on health in particular , and to lower taxes , especially for the lower-paid . #% Mr President , the link between the common foreign and security policy and space policy is very clear , both in the Commission 's White Paper and in the resolution . #% My sole regret is that , to date , my region -- Northern Ireland -- has not yet availed itself of this facility , though I would have to say , biased as I am , that we are rich in such commodities . #% I agree - and have frequently repeated - that in order to have a common agricultural policy it was not necessary to take fish into common ownership . #% I very much regret that and I have already assured him that I will use my offices to try to resolve that difficulty . #% It has been said that he has three jobs but only one salary . #% The trade in wild animal meat for human consumption is just one part of a wildlife trade which includes ivory , fur and the trade in certain animal body parts -- a trade which threatens biodiversity and the ecological balance of areas such as Central and West Africa . #% This mistake was made in India in 1970s and 1980s , in attempting to solve water shortages . #% I have been bullied and harassed by lobbyists . #% The north-west , the west and the Shannon regions are displaying the weakest growth . #% The majority of these tragedies occurred on secondary roads and were the result of driving under the influence of alcohol , speed and , in my opinion , the fact that they were driving on the left-hand side of the road in Ireland -- a practice to which they are not accustomed . #% Freedom of worship is a fundamental right recognised by most of us in Europe . #% If our buildings and , in particular , our houses were designed properly we could manage with hardly any heating or cooling equipment . #% This Parliament and the European Union should , and must , be most vigorous in pursuing full answers to these most important public health and human rights issues . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur . #% The rate of this tax should fully reflect each Member State 's requirements environmental , economic and physical . #% Ireland has demonstrated how its young people are contributing in a major way to its significant economic growth . #% Therefore , either some fund should be set up to help grieving families if they find themselves unable to pay the costs of repatriation and if they are not covered by insurance , or perhaps we might look at the social welfare systems across Europe to see if they could be used to help . #% I wonder whether the Commissioner could say whether it is possible to look at those criteria in a cross-comparative way , because I fear that we will neither fall within the Objective 1 criteria on raw GDP , nor perhaps be eligible under defined unemployment statistics for Objective 2 after 1999 , in which case we will fall between both stools . #% If it is not removed our great movement will come to a halt because any one Member State can say : thus far and no further . #% The President-in-Office has heard that from the Members here this afternoon . #% Drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are okay ? #% If I am blind in Ireland , I am blind in Europe . ' #% The Commission suggested that seven new substances should be added to the list for eventual exclusion . #% There , economic interests have overtaken political principle and if we fail to act as one , particularly where principle is involved , then we will have no meaningful role in the geopolitical world . #% The basic underlying food-safety legislation is that safety should be established on the basis of scientific risk assessment and that consumers should be able to purchase products of their choice provided that they are safe . #% Mr Ahern 's slogan at home is ` more to do ' . #% In the case of Ireland where I come from , it is estimated that it would take 10 billion euro to bring our road networks up to the average EU standard , even if we have just enjoyed six years of very generous structural funds . #% There are other groups involved in paramilitary activities , beatings and shootings . #% We owe it to future generations to take seriously the long-term implications of the uncontrolled emissions of CO2 and their impact on the environment . #% In particular , his efforts to achieve a consensus have led to the Socialist Group 's amendments - both to strengthen the ` must carry ' provisions and to give stronger rights of access to disabled users - being carried in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . #% What is clear is that the political will is not there . #% We , in this House , should not accept that there is any doubt about EMU . #% Furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland . #% It would be worthwhile if we had this study brought forward as quickly as possible , perhaps with a more open mind , to see if it is possible to retain duty-free sales . #% A new information technology age has arrived . #% However , I do not agree that the retirement age for workers should be raised . #% I hope that the silver lining on this very dark cloud that sits over the event will be a credible assurance from the authorities in Egypt that their security forces will act in compliance with international standards and without a disproportionate use of force in the future . #% If Yahoo and Google can censor the web to suit a totalitarian Chinese Government , they can certainly censor the web for the benefit of our children . #% Though Commissioner Almunia must be applauded for his favourable comments on the crisis today , we as MEPs also have the opportunity through this report to aid an industry which has just been brought to its knees for the third time in the last ten years . #% It is very difficult to get attention , which is quite frustrating . #% It is unfortunate that the PSE Group did not support us on this . #% In this respect , it is imperative that we encourage a preventive approach and I welcome a number of recent Commission initiatives in this area . #% The central aspect to the implementation of new employment must be a need to guarantee a fair distribution of job opportunities throughout each Member State through the process of regionalisation and decentralisation . #% This is an integral part of the overall strategy to implement the Lisbon process , so as to guarantee that the European Union becomes the most competitive economy in the world by 2010 . #% It is not a partisan report . #% There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.3 . #% In this regard , it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost . #% Inclusion in the Treaty needs to be followed up with responsibility for the wide range of children 's issues being coordinated by a single Commissioner and unit within the Commission . #% The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform . #% I do not apportion blame - there is wrong on both sides , but I do stress the need for an immediate and effective ceasefire . #% But the resulting congestion now acts as a serious brake on further growth . #% The time has come for us in this Parliament , on behalf of the European citizens , to establish our authority and leadership in this vital area of international trade . #% With respect to the neutral countries , some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence . #% Fundamentally , we all want to support an end to political violence in Spain . #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his report this morning and his presentation and for pointing out to us the problems that we have in this area . #% From an Irish perspective over 90 % of our waste is still dealt with via landfill sites . #% I wish her well during the presidency and hope that her relationship with the Members will be as open and blunt as it has been this afternoon . #% The attitude within the European Union towards asylum-seekers has to change . #% If today 's debate , Mr President-in-Office , can underline any message , the message is : take the courage and conviction from here that the rules must be changed . #% I would like to point out to the President-in-Office that this target of 0.7 % was agreed 35 years ago and to date only five states , four of them EU states -- four out of 25 EU states -- have met this target of 0.7 % . #% Many must seek further part-time work to supplement their income . #% However , one of the conclusions I have come to is that we need to look closely at the manner in which financial services are regulated , because it would appear that we expect a regulator to do two functions which are distinctly different . #% What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state ? #% 
I believe that the Commission too must recognise that the expanded remit of the codecision procedure means that Parliament has an equal say in the enactment of EU directives and regulations encompassing 38 different economic and social sectors . #% Some of those issues need clarification , and at the same time , the raison d'être of the development round are the needs of agriculture in developing countries where , proportionately , it is of far more importance than it is in the European Union . #% I think people need to be told that the European Union is an unprecedented success , compared with anything that went before at any time in history , following unprecedented consultation . #% I therefore agree that the discharge should be given for 1995 . #% We must all seek to restore Iraq to the international community under an indigenous and representative government . #% Young farmers have computers . #% Eight million people are affected with Alzheimer 's in the EU , so in effect the EU has spent less than 13 Belgian francs on each sufferer . #% Perhaps they can find it out now . #% Clearly , the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed . #% I do not believe that the compensation package of ECU 650 million is sufficient , but it is a start . #% The Commission taught Member States over the years how to be open with very limited resources . #% Structural funds are a key financial instrument . #% We lay great emphasis on SMEs , as you will see , and I look forward to some sort of rational discussion with the Council about its motivation for making cuts which appear to contradict every policy of the European Union . #% We are anxious to ensure that there will be no delay between the ending of the present LEADER II and the beginning of LEADER III . #% Will the Council today , with the support of my own country , Ireland , make GMOs exempt from the Aarhus Convention ? #% With the forecast growth in electronic shopping over the next few years , heavy bank fees for money changes will be a serious disincentive for consumers to shop over the Internet . #% On balance , Mr Eurlings has done an exceptional job in producing a tough but fair report on the story of Turkish accession so far . #% Maybe the Council should now look again at some of its own decisions , particularly with regard to areas like duty-free and other decisions to exempt those areas from attacks of this kind . #% TGV is not an option for us . #% The Commissioner has the support of the European Parliament in pushing forward Altener II . #% Mr Bowe has said that it is essential that the public should participate and also that there should be proper training . #% We have a procedure and that is that we should proceed now to questioning in depth . #% I also welcome the comments made by the Commission President , Mr Prodi . #% That is something that we have to take up because it could result in a long-term discrediting of regional policy . #% Certainly not the United Kingdom authorities - and it does not really matter whether it is a Conservative or Labour Government . #% The European Union is extremely wrong in subsidizing something which shortens the lives of its users . #% However , I have one concern with regard to the question of a judgment that is not yet final : we are acting as judge and jury in denying somebody a right to be an applicant for a tender without having a final decision or analysis made as to whether that person is guilty of a crime or not . #% These are matters which the President-in-Office of the Council and this House need to consider thoroughly . #% I would like to make two suggestions . #% I want to compliment Mrs Wallis on the preparation and the presentation of her report . #% People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco . #% That is not to forgive the atrocities that were committed or to say that the wrongs did not take place ; it is to say that you can not go on living in the past , you can not remain bitter . #% Again , Mr President , thank you for your statement . #% It is extremely important therefore that the measures we are proposing here today are proportionate and justified , and are effective , not only in dealing with terrorism , but also in seeking to ensure that terrorism can not thrive . #% His failure to do so should be met with only one response and that is the military option . #% These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors . #% To have voted for Mr Fabre-Aubrespy 's motion of censure to sack the Commission today , at the critical juncture when the Commission needs to be capable of taking major decisions on Agenda 2000 and reform of regional grants , could have thrown this decision-making process into paralysis . #% I would much rather be talking about problems of conflict of interest in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Competition , or ineptitude in relation to the Commissioner-designate for Energy . #% I very much welcome the Spanish Government 's objective of promoting more police cooperation across the borders of the Union . #% The key we believe is sharing best practice . #% That is why the Stability and Growth Pact is a good thing , in spite of the faults and mistakes in its operation that have recently been highlighted . #% Our colleague over in the far corner of the House spoke earlier and quoted the Bible . #% Let me put on record that it is important that we tackle issues of real importance to people in Europe , not just the global issues , not just the grande politique , but real issues that affect real people 's lives . #% I will attend to it this week . #% They should also stop exploiting them . #% Mr President , Mr Churchill , who I think was a Conservative , indicated on more than one occasion that he thought the democratic system was not great , but it was the best that we had and we had to defend it and protect it and , indeed , we have to regulate it . #% This was essential . #% That is not my vision for Europe . #% It was not the common fisheries policy in itself that destroyed the stocks , it was the lack of the necessary supervision . #% Moreover , financial support will be given to both students and educational staff members who are participating in the Erasmus World initiative . #% This is a defeat for families with young babies . #% I am appalled at Commissioner Byrne who also bent over backwards to help the owner of the , the world 's biggest pelagic trawler , to get that fishing licence . #% Given the relatively small size of the area that is Northern Ireland and the border counties , it has touched a large proportion of the population . #% If the Commissioner could come forward with an idea of being the collator of information , at least we could then say that there is 10 % or 12 % or 50 % , instead of using guess-work or guess-figures as regards the extent of disease , illness or disability prevalent in our Union . #% It is all very well changing what you call them , but if you do not change the approach there is very little to get excited about . #% I am delighted that Mr Prodi is prepared to be proactive . #% But who will speak for the lonely and the unfairly treated ? #% This state company has recently announced its intention to review its entire network , particularly the freight network , with the possibility that it may be closed entirely . #% The cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective . #% Mr President , I am against this amendment . #% As I said , the presidency and the Council 's concern is with cooperation and the protection of the external frontiers of the European Union . #% May I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative ? #% If anything , we have failed those people who are the most vulnerable - the long-term unemployed - by what we have put in place over the last five years . #% But , most of all , we stand today in our common bond of humanity as our American friends bravely search for their survivors and for their dead . #% But we should not pull down the good structures and leave our farmers and their families on their own . #% You have to address the problem within the situation in which young people find themselves today . #% 
What I want to see in the Fifth Framework Programme , which did not happen in the Fourth in all areas , is attention to the implications for society of the research which these brains are working on . #% The organization now has a permanent Council which meets on a weekly basis and which now provides the opportunity for all OSCE issues to be addressed . #% Given the opportunity and a favourable community infrastructure , the citizens of rural Europe are actively participating in enterprise programmes , creating much-needed employment and contributing to the sustainability of rural communities . #% For example , it is estimated that over 70 million polyester bottles are sold in Ireland each year and the improper disposal of even a very small proportion of these could make a significant contribution to environmental litter . #% We are , per capita , the worst country as regards complaints . #% The Colombian authorities have made numerous serious prejudicial comments which cast doubts on the possibility of the trial being fair . #% An emergency must be documented by a veterinary surgeon on call 24 hours per day , 7 days a week . #% So I hope the Commission takes note that the instruments are there by which we could carry out testing and make sure that the harmonisation of homeopathic medicinal products with therapeutic indications is properly tested . #% Appendix II contains most of the species regulated by the Commission . #% We are all very concerned about the impact on employment of the beef crisis . #% Some kind of balance sheet that would bring this into some sort of reasonable focus is needed . #% This matter may be highlighted to an even greater extent with the advent and introduction of the single currency next year . #% The only two legal cases pending against the Irish Government include one with regard to the provision of waste management plans ( similar cases are being taken out against several Member States ) . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur for taking on the Commission and for taking it to task in relation to its glaring omissions and its oversights . #% I have recently been warned by research scientists in my own constituency who have visited South-East Asia that we are kidding ourselves if we imagine that they are not about to overtake us . #% It can not undermine the right to private copying as provided for in the Copyright directive , and in fact reinforces that right and protects the right of privacy . #% The adoption of this legislation constitutes a major step in ensuring equal treatment to third-country nationals across the territory of the EU . #% Mr President , I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur and to say that I welcome this initiative , which clarifies the relationship between , on the one hand , state aid and , on the other hand , the provision by Member States of compensation for the cost of services of general economic interest . #% I defend what you have done . #% Mr President , I voted against this resolution because I feel Parliament is extremely reluctant to criticise NATO and NATO 's actions . #% Our response to the SARS pandemic shows what we can do if we make communicable diseases a priority . #% One of the tragedies of our planet is the waste of human intelligence and creativity in countries which have been politically discriminatory or else riven by poverty . #% Flooding from the River Barrow , the second longest river in Ireland , has meant much of Carlow has been under water for over four days ! #% We must take the long-term view when dealing with the disposal of packaging waste . #% I was in Brussels , along with Mr Stevenson , when the negotiations took place last December . #% Can the Commissioner tell us tonight whether the British Government put forward proposals for such a package and whether that package will be forthcoming ? #% in writing . - This initiative by the Parliament is of special importance this year as it gives MEPs a chance to give their opinion on how the European Central Bank has reacted to the banking crisis . #% Self-harm is also emphasised because of its increasing incidence . #% Ironically , by comparison , the Presidency strongly criticised the elections in Togo on 27 October , where there was no EU observation mission , yet you chose to ignore the conclusion of the Pakistan mission that had been operating for two and a half months . #% Many industries in Malta which export a wide variety of semi-manufactured goods are owned by British , French , German and Italian companies . #% Secondly , dealing with special facilities for the elderly population , particularly in this year , the International Year of the Elderly . #% The Union and the applicant countries must sit down and hammer out an agreement on the difficult chapters of the discussions because otherwise enlargement of the Union can not take place quickly and will not be a success . #% An emissions trading scheme and auctioning rights are worth investigating , but , I ask the Commissioner , would a stand-alone or closed ETS for aviation not fall at the first hurdle , since all the trading entities would be net buyers and there would be no market ? #% We have a situation in Ethiopia where we knew for the past three years that there was a famine coming . #% We are retracting from milk , poultry and grain markets , not to mention beef . #% Increasing crude oil prices are having a detrimental effect on the European economy and are likely to impede our chances of attaining the Lisbon objectives of high quality full employment . #% Firstly I would like to welcome the Commissioner to his first Question Time in Parliament . #% The Commission has a responsibility to find out why food prices to consumers are increasing steadily while farmers ' product prices continue to fall heavily . #% I would urge the Belgian presidency and those that follow to maintain that pace , focus and commitment . #% An example is that biotech produces therapeutic treatments which are intended to benefit patients . #% I have a direct question for the Commissioner . #% During an economic crisis , there are increased risks of poverty and social exclusion for many citizens , but particularly for those on the margins of society , for those who become unemployed and for those who rely on the various social safety nets that operate within the different Member States . #% The proposed Constitution is the fulfilment of that dream , to be pursued , if necessary , without those states where nationalistic chauvinism still rules . #% The President-elect of the Commission , Mr Prodi , has certainly made it clear that he intends to guarantee that the European Commission and the European Parliament will work extremely closely together on the implementation of a comprehensive work programme within the Union over the next five years . #% I do not think the Council has been particularly active in the past . #% First and foremost I should like to thank Stephen Hughes for his report and indeed for seeking to raise the whole issue of gender balance in the boards of the Health and Safety Authority . #% Some have argued that it is not reasonable to try and change a programme in the last year or that certain aspects of the proposal are contrary to the idea of natural justice . #% The list is extensive and we are taking it on trust . #% These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states . #% We can not afford further risk to the industry . #% I am seriously concerned , as many others are , with the ever-deteriorating state of the beef market and the confusion being created with regard to the vital matter of public health . #% It is a good working document and we have a good basis to start working , so I congratulate the Commission as well . #% With regard to peace funding , the EU has enabled many people of goodwill to contribute to peace-building in Northern Ireland . #% There now exists in Ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in Sellafield . #% That is not the fault of the rapporteur , it is down to the fact that we do not have consistent and systematic collection of proper data . #% Of course , it is not the poor in general who carry out the acts but those responsible for the acts are often poor . #% I have seen the newspaper reports that the Irish Minister has requested this ministerial mission and am glad that it has been organised . #% Following on what Mr Schiedermeier has said , it is important to recognize that we can protect workers ' rights and social entitlement , but that does not mean we have to add on more bureaucracy and red tape . #% We would like to see the rights of the pro-democracy movement in Indonesia recognized . #% They too have a role . #% I trust the Commission will be more forthcoming as to whether or not it believes such a trade is actually going on . #% We need to ensure that this is not the case . #% This is in nobody 's interests in either rural or urban areas . #% They have compromised the good names and reputations of those people in their own political family who were witnesses to , but not involved in , this murder . #% But whatever honeyed words are attached to the conclusions of the procedure , the bottom line is that junior doctors will not secure benefits for a period of nine years at least . #% In the light of all these considerations , I can recommend this report to the House . #% 
I agree with the observations of colleagues about fears of a drift in certain cases towards unilateralism , some of the points about bilateral versus multilateral trade and issues about Kyoto , the Echelon Committee , the death penalty , and so on . #% Speaking personally , I share some of the concerns which the Member raises . #% Can the position be improved on as a matter of urgency ? #% A failure on our part to face political realities honestly and objectively undermines our ability to exert influence in bringing this bloody and terrible conflict to an end . #% I thank the Commissioner for his answer . #% An example of this would be the cooperation that was put in place for the different Member States of the EU concerning the fight against SARS last year . #% This Constitution will give us more democracy , more rights and more potential for a prosperous society in Europe , and indeed for solidarity with the rest of the world . #% We appreciate that the economic development of eastern Europe will in the longer term bring economic advantages for all of us . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of this report as in a limited way it takes a step in the direction of tackling the current lack of transparency in relation to export credits and in tackling the massive gap between the stated objectives of the EU and the reality of how export credits are used in the EU . #% In short , Commissioner , this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate . #% I would also like to pay particular tribute to our rapporteur who has brought forward a very balanced document which recognizes the new reality in which we now operate . #% We must get serious about this problem and also look at the countries that are claiming to have met their obligations under the MAGP , to ensure that they are not transferring their vessels to other flags . #% I was pleased to table amendments to Mrs Napoletano 's report to look for a much more sustained approach with better funding for our urban areas and I hope the Commission will take these views on board when they produce their Agenda 2000 proposals , following negotiations with ministers in Council . #% While this is well-intentioned , we can not support this approach because it could be interpreted , taken in a vague sense , to mean that levies should always be introduced when you have no technical protection in place . #% This is why I am quite keen on the idea of the European Rail Agency proposed in the Savary report , because there are a lot of other aspects in this rail debate which need to be addressed , both in terms of the commercial life of Europe , but also its spatial development and the development of cohesion . #% It simply can not and never will do it . #% . Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work . #% I would like to put on record my disappointment at Mr Allister 's comment on Mrs de Brún speaking a language ` no one cares to understand ' . #% This IGC will examine what key amendments must be made to the body of EU legislation to take account of the impending enlargement of the European Union . #% in writing . - The recent earthquake in Haiti demonstrates to us all how fragile living on this earth can be . #% Finally , as regards the period of reflection on the Constitution , I consider it wrong to call it a constitution , and was delighted that the Foreign Ministers said in Austria that it was wrong to do so . #% It is not enough to talk about the need to ensure that developing countries have sufficient resources to feed and to provide for their own people . #% We must recognize economic development , social development , environmental protection and human rights as mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development . #% Those farmers get ECU 2 billion from the Union . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his brief response . #% Why are cars built in the UK cheaper on the continent just as our pound is making our exports more expensive ? #% No details were given on the types of arms that would be exported , their value , or the decisions that would likely be taken regarding the other 44 licences . #% This year , of the money which is available to us , we are sending back ECU 2.27 billion . #% I am one of many Members in this House from EU countries that have facilitated the landing and refuelling of US aircraft -- military and CIA -- in recent years . #% Clearly , the Commission has been remiss in assessing the damage both to the shipping and airline business resulting from the abolition of duty-free : its effect on costs and fares and above all , in the regions , its effect on employment . #% If BNFL is successful with this application , while it will result in halving the levels of technetium 99 that are dumped in the Irish Sea , this will still be 15 times higher than the levels which existed in 1992 . #% I am sure that the Commission is perfectly aware of these other approaches but they are convinced that the Council and the fishing industry do not have the interest or the courage to explore other ideas . #% However , it is imperative that the additional data and developments which have come too late be incorporated in this regulation and ensure that it is part of the regulation coming into force on 1 January . #% Mr President , I wish to raise an issue of pressing importance to the farming community in my constituency . #% Despite all the honeyed words we may spout here , the reality of who is best able to deliver on those strategies -- who is best able to give those skills to young workers , students or older people who want to retrain or re-skill -- is that it is not the European Union , but each Member State . #% Mr President , this week the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party raised consciousness inside and outside this House of the fact that the rules of engagement for the democratic control of the European Commission by this Parliament are self-evidently inadequate . #% The EU has human rights and international law at the centre of its value system and it is our responsibility to call for the truth behind this tragedy . #% It was the only equitable and honourable outcome . #% Your path of non-violence has finally , please God , won forever the sort of peace we have all been praying for in Northern Ireland for a great many years . #% Progress on giving real credibility to food and consumer policy has been substantial in the past twelve months . #% While medical treatments are improving , and while standards of care , standards of treatment and the cost of such care are paramount in our concerns , if one can prevent transmission of such diseases , then we may go a long way to reducing the number of those affected . #% On a broader front , I can not emphasise strongly enough the importance of SMEs to both the Irish and the European economies . #% So we should remember that it was not entirely clear from the very start where we were going . #% However , the same basic barriers and problems still exist . #% We must insist on the right to take part in all decisions made about our environment . #% The report naively gives the impression that if you have some sort of democratic control , all will be okay . #% Yes , my friends , we have to have a strong Europol , yes , we have got to work towards that and , yes , we must look to cooperate where it is in the best interests of everyone . #% Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy . #% Where there is increased market access we must be sensitive to some products ; if the markets are to be destabilised we have to bring in mechanisms to control that destabilisation . #% There are even examples of shipowners being funded by the FIFG to export to flag of convenience countries . #% I am glad to hear you say , Commissioner , that agriculture is still of huge importance . #% We will indeed leave a terrible inheritance to our children if we do not ensure that the current situation changes . #% In the interests of saving time I will not insist on giving any fuller explanation . #% However it must be remembered that the attempt to establish common norms regarding safe country , and the concept of safe country of origin , in general is restrictive and could be used and abused by member states . #% We must prevent divisions , divisions between the regions of Europe , between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe . #% I condemn it for that . #% For these small-scale farmers , who one would have considered unfortunate enough not to have secured some type of part-time work , the option of work on state sponsored schemes became available . #% Other World Trade Organization partners must also be willing to make a success of this round , not only in the area of agriculture , but also in the industrial services and trade facilitation areas of the negotiations . #% I believe the Treaty of Nice is a balanced agreement which guarantees the go-ahead to the enlargement process whilst at the same time protecting and promoting the entries of the smaller Member States . #% This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations . #% Madam President , I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply . #% However , on the general issue of aid , it is important to point out that , although the total aid from the international community may seem enormous when compared to other areas in crisis , Afghanistan is at the bottom of the pile when we look at aid given per capita . #% Mr President , I am in favour of research . #% At the very least the Irish compromise should have taken into account the will of Parliament , particularly in relation to a number of crucial issues , for example the temperature of the vehicle in which animals are transported and the fact that it will not be mandatory to unload them temporarily at ports . #% That is only the tip of the iceberg , because there are thousands of women and children and young people who are being abused constantly . #% This House must be vigilant in ensuring that it can never again be repeated . #% 
We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live . #% Simplification is the key : not complication . #% Considering that we are coming up to Christmas , this cruel and inhumane way of producing so-called food is unacceptable . #% Many of my colleagues have spoken about the blame game and who is more to blame , because President Barroso did not say this or a government did not say that . #% We should remember we are not dealing with the Atlantic . #% All for the sake of ` clarification ' . #% I wish to give my wholehearted support to the McCartney family in their quest for justice for their brother Robert . #% I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteurs on their work , and also commending their work to the House , because of the cooperation that there was between the different rapporteurs . #% In Europe much has already been done to fight cyber crime . #% Thankfully the measures put in place are proving their effectiveness and there is now an acute awareness on the part of all involved , from producers to processors , from the retail to the catering trade , that any breach of the regulations is unacceptable and will be severely dealt with . #% The financial sector is under-taxed . #% It is interesting to see the geographic interest and to recognize the diversity that enlargement has brought to thinking on afforestation in the Union . #% Mr President , the report presented to us today by my colleague , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , is comprehensive in its analysis of the activities of EURES over the period 1998 to 1999 and constructive in relation to the proposal he makes for the future activities of this network . #% There were banner headlines just because the Commission published , a few days ago , a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced . #% It is important to thrash out the rights of the host country and the obligations of the home country . #% That is an important thing to recognise because in my area farmers feel very secure because of the very low instances we have of BSE and because of the strict controls that we have monitored and made sure worked over recent years . #% Mr President , I should like to ask for your advice . #% Massive support must therefore be given to peace builders , to ordinary people who on a day-to-day basis begin to build trust and seek out a shared future . #% The concept offers education on the European Union and , by providing accommodation for the political groups , it ensures that the views of this Parliament can be conveyed to the citizens . #% It is this Parliament 's duty to help financially . #% For a lot of people , that one click is like trying to climb Everest because they have not been brought up in the information technology age and they have no access to education or training to ensure that they can make use of this wonderful new tool . #% I also join in the expressions of regret and sympathy in respect of ETA 's very many unnecessary victims . #% It is a great credit to these soldiers and to the Iranian Government that they have tried to stem the flow of heroin destined for the streets of Europe . #% We need to take on board a proposal of this Parliament that we put in place a directive , not a one-fit-for-all directive , but a directive which would provide a framework for services of general interest , which would establish the principles on which they are to be provided and which would put on an institutional basis an evaluation of how those services are delivered . #% So certainly let us address the problem of structural deficiencies but let us also recognize that there is a lack of principle involved in some of the ways we shape our policy . #% It seems to me , Commissioner , that in any event that you may end up in court if you do not comply . #% I am also asking the Commission to take up the idea in my amendment on improved health briefings and health warnings on tickets in advance of flying . #% It is the last one on our schedule today and it is not a coincidence that it has been taken out of turn . #% It is particularly important to say that at this time . #% I believe there is an important principle here in relation to access to information . #% In the EPP we have put the family at the centre of our thinking . #% The setting up of an Internet charter would be a very sensible idea and one which would be for the benefit of consumers . #% Over the years we achieved real control and achieved the possibility to affect the management of the resources of the European Union . #% Mr President , the Greek Government assumed presidency of the Union at a time of great international uncertainty and political instability . #% Future EPA negotiations , as well as eventual implementation , should be the subject of closer parliamentary scrutiny . #% We need to deal with this and should not run away from it . #% EMU must meet the needs not only of central bankers but also of the millions of unemployed throughout the Union . #% In this context , I welcome the recent decision by the Turkish parliament to adopt a constitutional reform package to bring Turkey further in line with the acquis communautaire . #% We can not support this any longer . #% The agreement needs to be limited in duration and liable for immediate termination should any obligation not be met . #% This has , I believe , been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House . #% I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their extremely positive cooperation . #% I believe any beneficiary of EU funding should be obliged to indicate in a prominent place such as websites , annual reports and even on headed paper the fact that they are in receipt of EU grants . #% A debate at this time would only suit the many Members in this House who are opposed to giving the eastern and central Europeans the opportunity to share in the economic growth we are enjoying in the European Union . #% He is a very distinguished Danish poet , one of your own countrymen , Mr President , Thorkild Bjørnvig , who is winning the prize for his translations of Rilke from German into Danish , which although not a minority language is less spoken than some of the other languages in the Community . #% When we look to the future , we look to women like the McCartneys , who refuse to bow down to intimidation and who want , more than anything , to live in a peaceful society . #% On competition policy , the Liberal Group believes the public service providers must continue to be subject to competition policy through Article 90 . #% I am very disappointed that those arrangements were not made and that this is the attitude of this House or its services . #% author . - Mr President , I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up ! #% It is in the domestic sector where we need to find ways to encourage firms to supply not simply electricity or gas , but electricity or gas as a means to have cool or warm houses , fridges , the electricity that is needed . #% This is an integrated approach which I hope to address in a later question by another Member of the House . #% This fund can provide for those who have lost their jobs to retrain and acquire qualifications to get back into the workforce . #% I completely concur with what you have just said , President-in-Office . #% Are we to be the victims of our own success ? #% I urge you , Mr President , to ask the Commission to monitor this situation very closely under the powers vested in it by means of the Euratom Treaty . #% So it is unacceptable that this aspect has not been properly assessed and taken into account . #% Surely we should not be faced with that within the borders of the European Union . #% A split second can change our lives , and the challenge is to save lives and to preserve health . #% These agreements are to speed up the procedure of deportation and fall far short of what should be done . #% When we look at the overall context of this new vista of the knowledge economy and at the opportunities it presents , there are opportunities , but the risk that we run is , because of the huge amounts of money required in investment and infrastructure , unless governments and other agencies are involved , along with private financing , then peripheral and rural areas will lose out on access to these opportunities . #% More and more scientific research shows that modern-day illnesses such as asthma , allergies , certain types of cancer and work-related illnesses are often the result of chemical products in the environment . #% Even if the gross registered tonnage of the fleet does not increase by transferring vessels , such a substitution of younger vessels for older ones will lead , inevitably , to an increase in the effective fishing capacity of the Latvian fleet . #% Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe , but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area . #% I believe that when this study is completed , it will confirm the worst fears of many in this House that 140 000 jobs will be lost throughout the EU , that air and ferry fares will increase and that EU tourism and regional policy will be undermined . #% They must be looked after . #% Irish consumer organisations are concerned about the possible inflationary implications of following other Member States in reducing the usage of these small coins or indeed withdrawing them . #% 
Worker consultation and information is a key part of the former but relatively unknown in the latter . #% I just want to make a technical announcement before we start voting . #% I understand that there may be some problems concerning ratification by some Member States . #% The only solution is to put in place a proper United Nations force with a very clear mandate . #% How can the Commission justify omitting the body or agency it openly recognises as an authority on North Sea fisheries and then studiously ignore the NSRAC ? #% The three factors I would attribute this success to are : firstly , the sound consensual politics pursued by governments over recent year , but particularly since 1993 ; secondly , the creation of the single market , which Irish exporters and industry have been able to exploit and , thirdly , the operation of the structural funds since the late 1980s . #% For the first time in the history of this particular Parliament an alternative resolution to the Swiebel report on fundamental rights is being proposed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro . #% I understand the anxieties of the adoptive parents , but I also appreciate the reasons behind the ban on inter-country adoptions . #% I also welcome the recognition of the international community 's responsibility to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity , as well as the clear responsibility of each individual state to protect their own citizens from these crimes . #% What I want it know is this : if , for example , these waste sites are closed down before the transposition into law of the directive , will they be exempt from the directive , in particular in relation to after-care ? #% They certainly are a mechanism but we must make sure that they do not have other unwanted effects . #% We have become starkly aware of more frequent and more severe natural disasters across the EU and the world . #% They are indeed the right way to sustainability , but we are not pursuing them strongly enough . #% Finally , I find it intolerable that in a major capital city like Dublin we still have an inefficient bus service from the airport to the city centre . #% As we are aware , the banking structure and its relationship with film varies across Europe . #% I accept that there are regions within Objective I regions and sub-regions within those regions that have not done as well as others . #% I should like to ask the Commissioner whether , within his own area of competence , he has brought forward any codes of best practice which should be copied by the Member States or by small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular when we consider that in its final resolution the Vienna Council placed particular emphasis on helping small and medium-sized enterprises for the changeover in the year 2000 . #% We should try to harmonize the criminal offence of paedophile activities , the criminal offence of child sex tourism and child pornography and there should be comparable penalties for such crimes throughout the Member States . #% The island of Ireland has been growing more rapidly than any other part of the developed world in the past 18 months during this peace process and the fruit was only beginning to ripen . #% The question of safeguarding external frontiers must be a matter for sovereign states and must be diverse as suits those states in their present circumstances and challenges . #% The worry that the telecommunication markets in Europe will result in higher telephone prices must not be replicated when gas markets open up . #% It is not enough simply to have occasional , carefully-edited reports presented to this House every now and then over the next six months . #% Would the Commission consider setting up a study ? #% I want also to recognize the leadership of David Trimble in bringing the majority of the Unionists of Northern Ireland alongside and I want to thank Jim Nicholson , too , a Member of this House also , for giving his considerable assistance and influence in support of David Trimble 's effort . #% I did so in particular because the other two sets of amendments ( Committee and Purvis ) would be next to be voted on and seemed likely at that stage to be carried . #% For this reason , staff concerned with the transport of animals must be fully trained to ensure a high level of care at all times . #% Significant environmental pollution of air and water and the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources have become characteristic of the early stages of developing industrial economies , as they were once with us . #% author . - Mr President , I welcome the attention drawn to the appalling and consistent crushing of human rights in Azerbaijan : no freedom for the media , dozens of journalists jailed , some beaten , some even killed in recent years . #% I would suggest that in the light of the difficulties we have had with making Eastern European states understand the importance of energy efficiency , this is an absolutely meaningless document . #% The significant advances made by the applicant countries in terms of enacting new EU legislation have certainly ensured that the enlargement negotiations can proceed at a stronger pace . #% Twenty percent of Europe ' s children live in poverty despite the countries of the EU being amongst the richest in the world . '' #% One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular . #% In the midst of the crisis the pig industry was robbed in one night of 40 % of its slaughter capacity and curing capacity . #% Instead , let us return to a bit of sanity , where we understand the value of farming , where farmers farm and are rewarded for their labours by a fair price for their produce . #% Over-fishing or over-exploitation of any limited resource will damage that resource to the detriment of all and therefore is absolutely unsustainable . #% The effect of a food containing a substance such as sugar or salt at a low or medium level , but consumed in great quantities , is much more damaging than that of a food containing a substance at a high level but consumed only occasionally . #% On a more national front I welcome the strategy of the Irish Government to reduce road deaths and injuries by 20 % before the year 2000 . #% author . - Madam President , we agree with the general approach of Yannick Jadot to this issue . #% Finally , I would urge the three Member States which have not yet ratified the EUROPOL convention to do so without delay . #% This was an important consideration for us . #% Choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one 's children is a very basic human right . #% I wish to raise one concern , however , with regard to beef imports into the EU . #% We fear that the Commission 's Declaration was an attempt to compromise the difficult political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council and with the support of the Commission . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round , which is not always the case . #% Secondly , can we utilise already existing airline hubs to ensure that peripheral areas can be serviced into those areas as well ? #% We should not be singling out aviation and ignoring shipping and the considerably greater impact from increasing road transport and car usage . #% The horrendous terror to which they have been subjected is unspeakable . #% My own Member State , Ireland , was known as the island of saints and scholars , with a great tradition for producing literature ; and the encouragement and promotion of reading and literature is always welcome . #% Very often rust-bucket , single-hull , decaying tankers carry enormous quantities of oil which are , in effect , environmental weapons of mass destruction . #% The Göteborg European Council decided that those applicant countries which are ready to join the European Union may complete accession negotiations by the end of this year . #% You lost . #% I have to ask why there was this last-minute inclusion on the agenda last Friday , without the proper teeing-up among the various political groups . #% The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully . #% I read today that Germany has come up with a somewhat bizarre solution which appears to be to cover nuclear power stations with artificial fog ! #% Firstly , yes , we need marketing assistance , fleet modernisation , fuel assistance , and proper recognition of the potential needs of inshore fishing , but the imposition of European harmonisation -- fishing gear control , data collection , a new Community initiative -- is the path , I fear , to restriction , not to growth . #% I believe that the Member States are now moving towards self-imposed nonutilization of funding and slowing-down our processes , which will lead to problems in the longer term . #% I congratulate the rapporteur on his report . #% European taxpayers do not want their money going to fund something that causes distress and harm to animals . #% But I realize that a problem exists . #% Regulation is necessary both economically and socially . #% It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas . #% A few weeks will give us an opportunity to produce a motion calling for and justifying the closure of Guantánamo Bay , in a form that can be supported by all of the main groups , with increased credibility in the build up to the EU-US Summit in late June . #% While I and my group will be voting in favour of this report , I wish to make it clear that there are some parts which we do not agree with . #% I therefore say , on behalf of my Group , that we reject the attempt by the French Government to link structural fund spending to EMU criteria . #% Your budgets denied rights and services to the most vulnerable in Irish society . #% Commissioner , will you agree that in that respect , it has been really a dismal failure and that EU trade agreements have mainly benefited EU-based transnational corporations who use their superior resources to batter small local producers in many poorer countries , causing serious dislocation , including loss of local employment and environmental destruction ? #% 
There have been thousands of victims in the conflict of Northern Ireland . #% We should foster multidisciplinary education and allow for more exchanges between higher education institutions in this sector . #% May I point out that the Moscow mechanism is not for the Council to use , it is for the OSCE to use . #% in writing . - Cohesion policy is a basic principle of European integration as it ensures equal development and the reduction of disparities within the EU whilst also protecting social and territorial cohesion . #% It is vital that we address the perception that patents are only for big business : small companies can , and do , gain from patent protection . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Commissioner , and commiserate with her for her illness . #% Efforts can only go so far while China , a deciding member , continues to sustain and prolong the conflict by supplying the region with arms . #% Due to these reasons , we can not support the Commission 's modified proposal , which would again only raise the financial costs and technical difficulties and would be entirely inadequate to the aim of added value in security . #% There is a potential clash of legal opinion in this regard . #% Consumers must once again be convinced that beef is a wholesome food . #% I say to the Commission : questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme . #% In the British legal system , which is the common law system , the rules of evidence were established over 322 years - and yet we are going to bring in common rules of evidence willy nilly ? #% Thank you for your reply and for your commitment to transparency . #% Because in Ireland there is no regional authority with real decision-making powers . #% The Reverend Quang and his associates have been relentlessly hounded by the Communist authorities . #% During the lunch break several Members from different groups across the House came to me and gave a different interpretation to what I had said , stating that they had felt personally insulted and aggrieved by my remarks . #% Mrs Lenz 's proposals will do something to improve that situation . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , can I also express my appreciation to the rapporteur for a very good report . #% However , it is unfortunate that the Russian authorities - the health and agricultural inspectorates - were giving mixed signals with regard to the issue of meat imports into Russia from the European Union and trying to divide the unity that exists within the European Union concerning the whole question of health and food safety , after we fought long and hard within the Union to create a common standard of good quality and guaranteed quality produce . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Langenhagen for her report , and also Mr Kofoed and Mr Kindermann . #% Killing someone to take their liver for research is murder . #% A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bulwark against the resurgence of extremism in the region . #% Our dependency on oil is proving too costly in every respect . #% Commissioner , I will send you a copy of this independent documentary , which shows that my constituent did not have a fair trial and that there was a severe problem with the police investigation . #% The consumer is already faced with fragmented regulations and enforcement . #% Everyone accepts that many of the EU stocks have been over-exploited . #% We need to address it . #% We expect the Council to build confidence into this system and not undermine it . #% Yet the integrated coastal zone initiatives already in existence are floundering , due mainly to lack of financial support . #% The rapporteur correctly identifies the major demographic challenges that we face here in the European Union and that we will have to meet in the future . #% However , some vessels fishing down there are European vessels flying other flags and established under joint ventures . #% The Union is at an historic crossroads and from 1 May 2004 we will be a Community of 25 different Member States . #% In Hong Kong last December I witnessed Korean farmers fighting for a livelihood which is currently being threatened by transnational grain corporations , who are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries . #% Looking at the directive , as Mrs Lucas has said , the only thing we can do is impose a ban on this type of feeding of animals . #% Even after the British rebate is taken into account the EU is scheduled to cost the UK # 4 298 million in 2006 . #% Already , within the European Union , Member States have ratified and transposed into their legal systems the European Convention on Human Rights , which , although the document is nearly 50 years old , has shown itself capable of evolving in line with changing conditions as well as developing new rights . #% If we were unable to intervene and intervene promptly and properly in Kosovo , on our own doorstep , without weeks and months of prevarication and legal consultation to see what we could or could not do , how could we really expect the EU to respond as we would wish and the citizens of Europe would wish to the tragedy in East Timor ? #% The use of cadmium should therefore be banned . #% I believe that a supply of fresh , cheap seafood can be a tremendous tourist attraction in peripheral regions , particularly for areas like Galicia , the west of Ireland and Scotland . #% Aid to the developing world must be in addition to Overseas Development Aid or risk not attaining the Millennium Development Goals . #% The prospect of deepening cooperation in the field of immigration and asylum policy is to be applauded . #% This cooperation will not be complete if we exclude the main actors affected by the fisheries policy , namely fishermen , producers ' organisations and vessel owners . #% We can not overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue . #% If we are to make progress as fast as possible in our efforts to improve Community health , we should be creating an incentive for the use of this product in order that a major health gain can be made . #% Mr President , I should like to thank my colleagues . #% We are happy that she is here this morning and has given a very full explanation of what she has undertaken . #% I noted recently that a colleague in this House suggested that there should be a tax on texts and emails . #% The Tenet and Mitchell proposals are still on the table and , together with the recent proposals from the Saudi Arabian government , they too provide a basis for the resumption of peace talks if there is a full compliance with the recent UN resolutions by the Israeli government . #% Certainly it would be extremely difficult and impracticable to secure the support of the European public to introduce unanimity for tax harmonisation changes or for decisions concerning foreign and security matters at European Council level . #% It will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the Union . #% Taxation is a Member State competence , not an EU one , and any reference to a CCCTB inevitably brings concerns about EU corporate tax rates , which is not something I can support . #% We should strive for the best possible Utopian ideal and work towards that . #% The CAP has seen vast changes , and we must ensure that it is fit for purpose in the 21st century . #% The only light at the end of the tunnel as regards my own country , Ireland , is that our Law Reform Commission announced yesterday - and I suspect it is because they saw something coming down the line from the Commissioner - that they were going to make that part of their research programme for the next year . #% The reality is that unless we are competitive , that unless we allow our businesses and enterprises to prosper , to grow and to compete on the world market we are ultimately doomed to fail ; not only in the sense of protecting existing jobs but also in ensuring that we try to find new forms of work for the long-term unemployed . #% An effective follow-on therapy should be provided for prisoners by the Eastern Health Board . #% On balance , given the nature of the HFR and the mix of budget items covered , the Fine Gael delegation voted to support Draft amending budget No 8/2009 . #% Human rights , labour and environmental standards and tax governance must guide EU negotiations with developing countries . #% We should see this Commission as a college and while the individual commissioners must be held accountable , nevertheless we must take an objective view of what is going on and beware of either European party politics or international politics colouring our judgement . #% Given the experience that many citizens have had purchasing overseas property , an online register reflecting all relevant charges affecting property ownership rights is vital . #% In spite of these efforts , something like 80 % of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish . #% Finally , phone penetration in Ireland , which presently stands at 15 % of the population , is set to double by the end of the year . #% An atrocity or a tragedy on the European continent is commemorated in the history books for every single day going back over 227 years . #% This is someone whose life is going to be terminated and his right both to produce new evidence and a fair trial has been denied . #% I give you the example of the now famous International Rice Bank where research into cross-breeding of many out of use and local strains of rice has led to the development of a new variety which is now showing up to a seven-fold yield improvement . #% This is blatant , modern-day colonialism and we should not allow it . #% 
Inevitably each Prime Minister puts his own spin on what summits achieve . #% However , that requires us to make an investment to guarantee that the technology is available for all and , through our taxation , to give preference to energies that are less damaging to the environment , as we did with the introduction of unleaded petrol many years ago . #% The recent dioxin scare in Belgium , prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat . #% Madam President , cadmium is a dangerous chemical . #% While the arguments in favour of a single currency have been debated at length by economists and public servants and are now well-known to most people working in politics , public administration and finance , the vast majority of Europe 's citizens are still not aware of the range of benefits which the single currency will bring to them . #% Finally , who is regulating the regulators ? #% As you know , the Assembly has been shut down for some time , so it is even more important that a clear signal is given that this programme will continue . #% As rapporteur , I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my colleagues , especially Mrs Müller , who drafted a very useful opinion from the Environment Committee . #% In Ireland over the last number of years there has been a tremendous increase in the number of companies making use of the ADAPT programme , and this has allowed them not only to give new opportunities to existing workers but also to expand into other areas of technology and to bring in new people who were unemployed or long-term unemployed . #% If the rates are increased , as I hope , we must ensure that ample money is allocated to axes 3 and 4 , as well as 1 and 2 . #% To be parochial , I wish to thank the Irish Permanent Representation for their tremendous work . #% We in the UK know the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak and how it brought both agriculture and tourism to their knees . #% Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn . #% We look forward to wide publicity for the benchmarking exercises , particularly in the areas of enterprise and innovation . #% For that we need an effective system of traceability and control that will restore confidence . #% The issues raised by the honourable Member have much merit and should be examined and advanced at an early stage . #% Fewer and fewer people are attracted to farming as a way of life , particularly when more rewarding work is available elsewhere . #% Mr President of the Commission , may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political . #% Madam President , I call on the Irish Government to immediately apply for natural disaster aid relief under the European Solidarity Fund . #% It is clear , as the Commissioner said , that we need to address this in our development and aid policies . #% Nevertheless , for the moment it must remain . #% It could also have responsibility for the rapid alert system itself . #% That has been the case for centuries - and will continue . #% I will vote against to ensure that in the longer term the Northern Ireland agriculture industry is not destroyed in the name of efficiency . #% I will be urging it to adopt such a position as this directive is not a first step in the right direction , but in fact a giant leap backwards . #% Mr President , the current World Trade negotiations are important to the future development of the EU , particularly in the context of enlargement . #% The independent producers were very concerned about this directive , and we must recognize and support our young , independent producers , who are already producing some of the best and most interesting programmes out of Europe . #% I would like first of all to reject the argument made by a number of people here that to increase own resources is to increase the burden of taxation on the citizens of Europe . #% I think it would be a grave error to start labelling organisations here as one religion or another . #% We must also impose standards on European firms that operate in the developing world and seek international cooperation to have tough standards and sanctions applied on a worldwide basis . #% A ` business as usual ' policy is not an option in a Europe that needs finance for jobs and growth . #% in writing . - Yet again we have an ideologically driven proposal , this time on postal services . #% Many people , especially old people , were confused as to the worth of the new Irish coins and notes at that time and were taken in by unscrupulous dealers . #% The redundancies at Dell have seriously affected the local Limerick economy and surrounding areas . #% I therefore urge that a firm and resolute stand be taken , with no fudging and no budging from the principle that no aid can flow from the EU to an authority run by the terrorists of Hamas . #% We can not criticise governments and , at the same time , sell weapons to them when they persecute their own people and territories that they have illegally occupied . #% Mr President , the Commissioner is working under the constraints of the undemocratic and anachronistic Euratom Treaty . #% Can we do anything in a positive way at this particular time nine years later ? #% Why should they face an anti-social life ? #% Mrs Doyle referred to the scare in my home county in my constituency in Northern Ireland . #% Mr President , on a point of order and by way of follow-up to Mr Newton Dunn 's point of order , I have been sitting here listening with great interest to what Mr Nielson has said , but had a specific question to put forward in part three . #% This is for us a core challenge . #% It is planting season now in southern Sudan . #% Firstly , there is the enormous increase in the use of X-rays during medical treatment and tests over the past twelve years throughout the European Union ; secondly , the significant progress in scientific knowledge and X-ray technology that has taken place over this time ; thirdly , the number of international organizations that have issued more updated recommendations on X-rays , and fourthly , Article 129 of the Maastricht Treaty , which has given the European Union new powers in public health . #% You briefly mentioned environmental issues and you should take this opportunity to ensure that all the outstanding complaints against Ireland in relation to breaches of EU law are addressed and resolved . #% In fact , you yourself , Commissioner , used the word subsidy . #% While I recognise that this is substantially less than the 40 000 that were there until the late 1990s , the Lebanese people clearly want the Syrian troops out of their country . #% We do not want to see further disintegration . #% In our once flourishing sugar industry , the lights have been switched off and the door closed in our last factory . #% I support Mrs Attwooll 's appeal for the A75 . #% We have got to learn from this and to ensure that in future , we have a solid base for response , as the Commissioner has said . #% Mr President , in the context of Johannesburg and the commitments to sustainability by the EU , it should not be too much to ask this Parliament to give concrete expression to sustainability , particularly in requiring that the principle of producer responsibility and the internalisation of external costs be enshrined in the current review . #% The fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear indication that we can all agree on this text . #% Mr President , it is a time of unprecedented change in agriculture . #% However , Dr Shipman was not struck off for malpractice and he was never identified as a problem by the UK 's own regulatory body . #% After the most recent enlargement that diversity is even greater and has expanded across the whole continent . #% I welcome the recent comments of Prime Minister Simitis , when he stated that the United Nations is the forum that must be used to address the issues raised in the UN inspectors ' report on Iraq . #% The European Union is currently dealing with difficult areas such as agricultural affairs , regional policy and budgetary matters . #% They gave their lives knowing that it was a suicide mission but , for fellow mankind and for the greater good of their countrymen and countrywomen , they took that action and took that dangerous task on board . #% I fully agree with Commissioner Reding on the need to reinforce and restructure programmes which are clearer to the citizens of an enlarged European Union . #% Can I assure the House , not simply on behalf of the presidency , but also as the Irish Member on the reflection group which went into a lot of these issues , that this matter is being examined in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and the presidency will do everything in its power to try to advance openness and transparency , while at the same time recognizing the right of Member States to have their business conducted in a way which is agreeable to everybody through a code of conduct . #% In the wake of the accounting scandal surrounding Italian food group Parmalat , which erupted in December 2003 with the revelation of a black hole of EUR 4 billion in lost funds and EUR 14 billion in unpaid debt , I believe we certainly need the Commission to set up a revised directive on corporate governance that could strengthen rules on auditing . #% Can you say who is blocking the multinational force which would be prepared to move into the region as a matter of urgency , as you suggested ? #% One way of choking off the effectiveness of the Ombudsman 's office and the Petitions Committee is to deny them adequate resources . #% Cadmium pollution of the environment carries very high health and economic costs , including water purification costs . #% It would be to the detriment of smaller states , to the detriment of smaller parties and peripheral regions . #% 
But I am also determined to ensure , insofar as I can in my small way , that we have a united , coherent , cohesive , common European foreign and defence policy . #% There has certainly been no debate in Dáil Éireann . #% These delays are taking place on many flights because of the difficulties with air traffic systems in Europe . #% Finally , we should put disputes in perspective , as the Commissioner has sought to do . #% Mrs Thatcher would be proud of the way we have carried on and she would be particularly proud of Terry Wynn this evening if she recognized the way he is defending what she fought so long for in relation to the European Union budget . #% They have all failed to implement the framework directive . #% We all too often have a tendency in Parliament , I am afraid , when we can not to do anything more concrete , to set up another institution . #% If it were not for the vigilance of politicians , NGOs , environmentalists and consumer interests , this technology would by now have been foisted on society . #% President-in-Office , your challenge is to ensure that the debate on the Constitution is concluded over the next six months ; this is a difficult task , but let me wish you every success in this particularly historic task . #% These are mainly covered by the Council 's common position which we very much welcome , because we feel it is important that there be some flexibility for the processing of traditional products and also in relation to artisanal production . #% It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there . #% The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting . #% Mr President , recent CAP reform will result in some fundamental changes , particularly at farm level . #% I welcome the proposal before us here today . #% A huge amount of damage has already been done to consumer trust and consumer confidence in the recent past . #% At the same time , getting legislation right in the internal market is critical to achieving the Lisbon goals of jobs , growth and competitiveness . #% I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States . #% Registration should be made mandatory and the Council should also join this agreement as soon as possible . #% This presidency was characterised by enthusiasm and diplomacy . #% Jobs have a therapeutic value as well as an economic value . #% in writing . - I support this Report which modifies the European Regional Development Fund in order to permit and facilitate energy efficiency and renewable energies interventions in the housing sector in all Member States . #% It is imperative that we also address the underlying problems within the countries from which these desperate people flee . #% Information technology has made extraordinary strides in recent years and the advent of the Internet has brought the benefits of IT into many homes and businesses in recent times . #% How can the Commission propose that an acceptable regional policy can be extended to the new states with just ECU 11 billion ? #% Mr President , regarding the order of business I should like to put on the official record my congratulations to my constituency colleague and good friend , Mr Cox , on his election as president of the ELDR group . #% I commend this motion to the House . #% We have own-initiative reports because we wish to highlight issues often to do with forthcoming legislation . #% The red squirrel -- our European native squirrel -- is now under threat through competition from a larger , more robust rival and through the destruction of its natural habitat , our deciduous woodland environment . #% We should recall that the accession negotiations are broken up into nearly 40 different chapters of talks , covering every ambit of social and economic activity that is carried out by the European Union . #% You have spoken out clearly on our behalf when clear statements were needed on the fight against terrorism and the protection of human rights . #% Is it the Commission ? #% Although the outbreak was debated in the plenary last night there will be no resolution on the subject . #% We have seen the destructive power of this rule recently when Britain , in a very misguided policy decision , held up most decisions for several months . #% Mr President , I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur . #% I have had the opportunity to go there and I know the people in that area are very much inclined to go forward and to be progressive . #% When negotiating EU-ACP agreements it is essential to stress the need for simplification and rationalization of aid instruments with a view to gradual evolution towards direct budgetary support for ACP countries . #% I regret that both my colleagues and myself who met with Commission officials many months ago have not heard from them or seen any action taken . #% We have demanded that international and national humanitarian organisations , as well as journalists , be granted full and unhindered access to the combat zone and to the refugee camps and we call on the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate with countries and aid organisations that are willing and able to evacuate civilians . #% This new directive , together with the existing Directive 89/381/EEC , will ensure that binding Community legislation will apply now to blood and blood products whatever the intended purpose . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur , Professor MacCormick , for his work on these two very difficult and contentious reports . #% In the words of the then Irish Presidency , over-fishing is part of the overall problem ; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term . #% Recent figures from the Irish Police Force say that 76 % of all crime in Ireland is drugsrelated . #% in writing . - I heartily congratulate the voters of the Republic Of Ireland on convincingly rejecting the repackaged Constitution . #% Energy performance certificates help to raise awareness of where energy and costs can be saved , and encouraging new buildings and newly refurbished buildings to have smart meters give consumers more control over their energy-related decisions . #% Israel-EU trade is worth EUR 27 billion annually . #% There is one point that , to many of us , is the issue of substance in this report . #% It is the most visible contribution so far by the European Union to building a stable society in Northern Ireland and , to that extent , it has enormous symbolic value as well . #% The investment chapter would , outrageously , give corporations the right to sue governments when social or environmental policies cut across their profiteering . #% Although Parliament is seeking a greater role , more involvement in coordination and quicker action , with hindsight it is also looking for more legislation to be put in place . #% In short , there is need for more research #% The National Crime Council in 2005 found that one in seven women in Ireland experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical , sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some times in their lives . #% However , the limitation of the 1994 directive was that as the number of accidents is fortunately very low , the opportunities to learn from them are very limited and lessons can , therefore , be drawn only after an accident has already happened . #% One-third of the population has been massacred and here we are waiting for an invitation from Indonesia . #% Our vote will allow this House to place the deeply sensitive issue of the peace process in Northern Ireland above our day-to-day political concerns . #% With only two minutes available to me , I have to be selective . #% This vote refers to certain Council Acts in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy . #% We have the legislation in Ireland , we have the minimum wage , but we are not properly enforcing that legislation . #% I voted against Prodi basically because he is a complete federalist and also in favour of the militarising of the EU which I do not approve of . #% In his book , ` The European Dream ' , Jeremy Rifkin comments on the remarkable recovery of European countries following the Second World War . #% The one sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those who are guilty of crimes against humanity that they will be brought to justice for their evil deeds . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment ? #% In addition , 13 Israeli Human Rights Organisations have protested to the Israeli Knesset and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding the increasingly systematic campaign against Human Rights Organisations in Israel . #% Mr President , on 28 October three United Nations aid workers were kidnapped in Afghanistan . #% Finally , I would like to say to this Parliament , to my colleagues and friends , that despite the best efforts of those in this House who have been trying to confuse the issue of the Treaty of Nice in relation to my country , the Irish people totally support enlargement . #% You urged the Irish Government to pursue the issue at EU level instead of simply under the OSPAR . #% The IGC is putting forward proposals to eliminate controls at the Union 's internal borders . #% 
Indeed , according to estimates , carbon dioxide accounts for 50 % of the greenhouse gases now present in the atmosphere . #% We call on those countries which possess nuclear weapons to fulfil their commitment to disarm by virtue of Article VI of the NPT . #% The production of high-quality regional products , and food products in particular , is essential if many of our rural areas are to be saved from depopulation . #% As a consequence we have inherited a large body of political and public opinion which is not committed to European integration and this has acted as a brake on our European ambitions . #% Ireland , in particular Ireland South , has a rich cultural and creative history . #% Ireland 's unique position is not included in the proposal for a directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste . #% Today 's narrow vote by Parliament not to reject the claim is very disappointing . #% This would be a gross injustice and deception of organic farmers , sellers and consumers . #% For example , the agreed objectives for the Member States ' combined fleets were so modest that the Community fleet as a whole was already smaller than the overall objectives , even before the MAGP IV entered into force . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , the inevitable arrival and recurrence of a flu pandemic has thrust the issue of vaccination to the forefront of the news agenda . #% We have a major responsibility as a Parliament to ensure that any future reform ensures that agriculture as an industry can compete and can survive in the future . #% Mr President , could you explain procedurally what happened to paragraph 3 ? #% All Member States have faced the same common issues : how to address the impact of demographic ageing or healthcare systems and expenditure , how to use the new technologies for the benefit of the elderly , how to ensure a better standard and quality of life for the elderly . #% Last week , in Brussels , we heard the Commission 's latest economic forecasts and on the basis of these projections , Commissioner de Silguy told us that up to eleven Member States will take part in EMU from January 1999 . #% We are all aware of the challenges that lie ahead for the European Union both economically and socially . #% I was very much against it . #% So , the Charter should have dealt with the issue of privatization of energy resources in greater detail , outlining the protection available to the consumer who ultimately would be affected by any changes in this regard . #% Would she , during her term of office between now and the end of the year , investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast , including my own area in the west of Ireland , which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet ? #% Indeed I will be calling on my own government in Ireland to refuse to participate in this rapid reaction force unless there is a clear commitment that these weapons will not be used . #% Technically it covers the period up to 30 June 2002 , but since Parliament is not going to do a report on the final situation as at 31 December , I will make some comments on the situation up to that date . #% I have no difficulty whatsoever with the need to develop the fishing ports that are , in many ways , hard-pressed through restructuring and depleted stocks . #% Mr President , the burden of funding the enlargement of the Union to the east should be shared by the existing Member States in a just and equitable manner . #% As an exercise , I logged onto one of the more popular websites a few minutes before I came down here and I found 1.8 million references to citizenship . #% However , right now there must be an insistence that those who cold-bloodedly murdered Mr McCartney and those who witnessed it should cooperate fully with the police service of Northern Ireland . #% We have an important role to play in the world and we should seek to play that role now of all times . #% I have been very clear on what I have said . #% Nor does it in any way pre-judge their guilt or innocence . #% I think it would be wrong for the Commission to portray itself purely in the guise of the terrible enforcer against the Member States , because sometimes there are mistakes and errors within the legislation which must be corrected , and flexibility is required to achieve this . #% Everybody interested in the issue should come along and listen to people outlining what they want . #% Mr President , we have to recognise that the relationship between the European Union and the United States is at an all-time low . #% For better or for worse , we are shaping Europe 's future by how we raise our children . #% EU funds have been used to finance health clinics and primary schools , the clearance of landmines , the return of key public service workers , the creation of jobs to combat the opium production that is spiralling in post-Taliban Afghanistan , the rebuilding of infrastructures , clean-up operations in 7 cities and support for the return of the 1.8 million or so refugees returning to the country . #% In addition , it was often difficult to identify the major priorities of any one year . #% I believe - after an 18 months ' investigation by a UK newspaper , following your investigation - that time is running out and the car industry now wants to find a settlement to this issue . #% Mr President , the Green Group welcomes the decision that was taken in June to get rid of driftnets for albacore , tuna and certain other species . #% Today we need more quality and we need to consider the environment . #% There is a clear need , based on the information that has been provided to us , for the European Union to become engaged in seeking to develop best practice across the European Union to ensure that the people of Europe have adequate access to services , therapies , drugs and indeed aftercare , and that they are not discriminated against in relation to employment . #% I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship . #% I would suggest that France and the Netherlands might consider establishing national conventions of Europe , to consider exactly what kind of Europe they want . #% More than a quarter of a million innocent people have been killed since 2003 , and a further 2.5 million people have been displaced . #% But the situation is shameful . #% When we speak about a barrier-free Europe for people with disabilities , our main focus is always on legislation , on new innovation with regard to buildings or access to transport . #% There is no need to confuse and mislead the consumers of Europe on a compulsory basis , because the voluntary labelling system which will be driven by competition , pride in product and consumer demand will add anything that a compulsory category label might otherwise require . #% Although transposition rates are improving , as shown in the internal market scoreboards , there is still room for much improvement . #% This procedure is fairly meaningless because , taking into consideration the budget constraints together with the GATT decisions , we have very little capacity to influence the price that farmers can obtain for their produce . #% I thank him for his very kind wishes . #% This is as I have said a vital agreement for the new South African democracy , but it is also the basis of a partnership of equals , one which will enhance both sides economically as well as strategically . #% To go to Taiwan , Hong Kong or South America once every five years is not sufficient and nobody is fooled by this any longer . #% We have to act , as the interior ministers did last week , when they suggested that long-term admission of Kosovars to countries outside the region would consolidate their displacement from their homes . #% Despite the fact that I had passes for them to go into the visitors ' gallery , they have been prevented from doing so . #% However , we discovered when looking at the Commission documentation , which as I said was provided very late - in fact , only this week - that it actually deals with military-grade plutonium and research into that . #% This was not an isolated incident . #% One of the key elements arising from the debate is the recognition at last that , unless the economic wealth can be created , together with the employment terms to guarantee jobs and security within those jobs and rights after those jobs , then the European social model is non-existent . #% This legislation is a gross affront to justice and the human rights of victims ; it is a stomach-churning illustration of how low governments can stoop when they set about appeasing terrorism . #% This provision - Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty - is clearly a recognition that the European Union must introduce confidence-building measures in the field of public and human health , in the light of difficulties which arose as a result of the problems relating to BSE and blood-contaminated products in many European states in recent years . #% I would also like to take the opportunity to refute the untrue allegation made by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington that the EU/EOM leaked an interim briefing report . #% I want to say to Mr Pinheiro that his contribution was very welcome . #% I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated . #% How then is the European family farm model to survive ? #% This kind of clarity can not be given on the basis of coexistence and promises of compensation after contamination : after contamination it is too late , it is no good to an organic farmer or to people who value their produce . #% She adds today a preface which says that if these matters were not investigated then the public might feel certain things . #% It can not hide behind other countries which say that they will veto any action taken against Sudan . #% The ambition to gain an EU seat within an enlarged Security Council has to be pursued . #% It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective . #% I share these concerns and I share some of the real concerns held by many people , and I understand them . #% Now reductions must be obtained on texting and email connections . #% 
The success of economic and monetary union has eliminated the possibility of seeing hungry speculators playing one currency off against the other for personal gain , while doing serious economic damage to European countries and to their citizens . #% We are conducting a hearing on the impact of public procurement laws on the internal market . #% Mr Quinn , the Finance Minister , has described EMU as fundamentally a political project , but he has failed to identify any political benefits which will come from it , or allay fears that it will simply widen the gap between rich and poor . #% As politicians we have a duty to inform ourselves before being dogmatic and proscriptive on matters of medical and scientific research , albeit with the regulatory tool of the precautionary principle for areas of scientific uncertainty available to us . #% One of the best ways of addressing this is by looking at the advertising industry . #% In the College of Quaestors we have also discussed - because we too are concerned - robberies that are taking place within Parliament . #% We must meet our Kyoto commitments : we have international treaties and obligations under them and it is time that we took this more seriously . #% I have known the honourable Member for a long number of years and I find very little to disagree with him about . #% From an Irish perspective , we should assist in humanitarian missions to the region . #% That is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end . #% We must devise measures to minimise the effects of the increase of variable costs that results from high fuel prices . #% The question , and it is an important one , is what comes after Kyoto ? #% Certainly in my group we have not prepared a list of speakers , nor do we wish to revert to that procedure at this moment . #% Hence we must keep raising this issue on occasions such as this . #% It is a fake , but was sold to consumers on the high street at full price . #% In my view , Amendment 50 is better than Amendment 57 when it comes to the adventitious and technically unavoidable contamination of feed ingredients . #% Mr President , this afternoon a very important event took place in Constanza County in Romania : the official opening of protected homes for over 100 people who currently live in unsatisfactory conditions . #% A resolution is clearly overdue and the question of compensation can not be side-stepped . #% I can not understand how the Council or anybody else could be surprised . #% In the conclusions to its communication the Commission lists among its priorities : better coherence between the various objectives pursued by the CFP , such as conservation of resources , the economic efficiency of the fleet and securing employment in fisheries - dependent areas , taking account of the economic dimension of fisheries management , better integration of environmental and fisheries policy , improvement of management tools such as multi-annual management objectives and strategies , management of fishing effort , and full integration of the Mediterranean into the Community management regime , a more accountable decision-making process and maintaining the external dimension of the common fisheries policy . #% The sensitivities of Northern Ireland are too important for any ill-informed bandwagoning on the International Fund for Ireland . #% This present Europe , as your presidency demonstrates , Mr Juncker , can not work . #% However , it is only right that the British Government should give categoric assurances that the highest possible safety standards will be met , because this issue is of huge concern to the people of Ireland and to many others . #% In my view true diplomacy , by opening and keeping open channels , is our best hope of advancing our views in relation to dealing with these problems . #% Madam President , let me begin by saying on behalf of my group that we fully share the perspective of Mr Prodi that certainly from tomorrow we stand on the threshold of a new beginning ; a new beginning in particular between our two institutions , Parliament and the Commission , and a new beginning for Europe itself . #% We must now consolidate the good will there is , secure agreement with regard to the bottom-line issues and try very hard to strike a deal before 17 June for the new European Treaty . #% We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred . #% This is the framework in which we must move forward to conclude the agricultural negotiations with the candidate countries . #% We also have to be aware of the substantial support given to the industry in the United States . #% In conclusion , in my opinion , one of the most important aspects of conservation of seeds and animals is the ever increasing possibilities in the area of biotechnology which these genetic resources may provide for the absolute benefit of a rapidly growing world population , much of which is already undernourished in many regions of the southern hemisphere . #% Under it , if a candidate country does not meet EU safety standards , it will not be allowed to sell food products in the internal market . #% Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder . #% This draft recommendation establishes minimum criteria to be applied in the organising , carrying out , following up and publicising of the results of environmental inspections . #% Having eventually banned the use of meat and bonemeal the British Government then completely failed to implement its ban . #% We will always remember Amsterdam ; we will always remember the European single currency . #% This represents a very reactionary response to problems which doubtless are there but which politics exist to overcome . #% Unfortunately , too often the stimulus for improving road and transport safety comes from devastating lessons that are hard learned from the past . #% That is right and proper , in view of the fact that the European Parliament has to approve the right of any Member State to accede to the Union as a new and full Member . #% We are already unpopular . #% We must prune the tree in order to allow growth . #% Preventing tobacco-related illnesses would do more to help the citizens of the Union than any other life-saving measure , and tobacco companies are wrong to claim that advertising does not promote smoking but only promotes brand loyalty for a legal product . #% We have the language skills and the necessary flexibility , productivity and labour costs . #% In retrospect , the last enlargement , without deepening , was premature . #% The main applications are in the building sector ( 57 % of total use ) , packaging , household appliances and cars . #% Mr President , the Commission proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions before Parliament is not , as some opponents of the directive have suggested , a new phenomenon . #% In addition , they should have the clearest and fullest information about every food product they consume so that they can make informed choices . #% Mr President , congratulations to the rapporteur , who has achieved a quite remarkable level of consensus right across this House . #% There is no use talking about helping Poland into a position of power when that could be disastrous for the agriculture interests of other parts of the Union . #% In relation to the controls he is proposing to impose on livestock producers so that we will have full records of the origins of cattle and their feed ; is he proposing to impose the same controls on the half a million tonnes of beef which we import into the Community annually ? #% President Lamfalussy of the EMI spoke to Parliament 's Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs on Monday and presented the annual report . #% Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry . #% Berlin was interpreted by farmers as setting the agricultural agenda , without adjustment , to 2006 , and for this reason I believe the recent decision by the Heads of State was correct and restores to some degree of normality what was becoming a contentious issue for farmers . #% What I want to say is that we should try to find a solution . #% This person paid quite a lot of money for the ticket ; it was not one of those tickets costing a couple of euro , it was quite expensive . #% They were disappointed in the British Government and bitterly disappointed at the way the months of ceasefire were squandered and the opportunity to establish a greater dialogue was lost . #% We must not give any succour to the forces in US politics who show a tendency towards isolationism , many of whose voices are now raised in the current US Presidential election . #% I hope that such a pact will reassure those who are concerned about the effects of a single currency on their jobs and businesses and on their savings . #% I strenuously reject any attempt by the Commission to construe the terms of that legal base so as to narrowly confine it to Article 95 ( 4 ) , which outlines a prior notification procedure . #% Workers ' rights should be guaranteed and defended . #% I am extremely proud of your presence in the chair and of the Taoiseach 's presence here as President of the Council of the European Union for the coming six months . #% My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria . #% I would like you confirm that it has done so . #% The trouble is that we have large quantities of poultry meat in storage . #% Precarious work refers to a type of non-standard employment mainly characterised by little or no job security , low level of payment , lack of social protection rights , no protection against discrimination and a work environment without minimum safety and health standards . #% Cheap imports are now the scourge of EU manufacturing and processing industries . #% Health warnings will take up 40 % of the front of the packet and 50 % of the back . #% 
We also need more adequate training for our lawyers and for our judges . #% However , any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair . #% This will be difficult to achieve as Parliament 's amendments will inevitably be seen to go well beyond the legal situation as regards the patenting of computer-implemented inventions and may indeed put us at odds with our obligations under TRIPs . #% The fact that the Americans are indebted to us for the solidarity and the support that we provided when they needed it should mean that we are entitled to a reciprocal response from them . #% Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency . #% On the other side , there is the current Prime Minister Abhisit and his party , who represent other sections of the elite . #% Would the Council take appropriate and urgent action to ensure that the EU is involved in this mission and in the coordination of international food aid with other international organisations ? #% The effect would have been to end the British measuring of bottled milk in pints and would change the size of our standard loaf . #% In particular , the new laws must not violate the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , nor must they in any way undermine the independence of the Hong Kong courts and their right to exercise the power of final jurisdiction . #% We voted last week to support the funding of uncontroversial stem-cell research using placenta , umbilical cord and adult stem cells . #% While health is a Member State competence , the European Community can add value and complement the activities of Member States through urgently needed coordination and collation of best practice models so that we can learn from each other and create centres of excellence . #% Europe is as incapable of creating jobs as the British Government is of creating jobs . #% That is a lie . #% The health of people , especially of children , is being put at risk in our countries in Europe and the health action plan in its present form is not equipped truly to protect us . #% We can not reasonably expect the farming community to have the balanced view of this issue that the wider community needs . #% What sort of world will we leave to the next generation ? #% As I said in reply to the honourable Member , in practice it is vital for the success of these missions that the state which they intend to visit should cooperate . #% I was extremely impressed recently on visiting the rapporteur 's own constituency , Galicia , to see the contribution that mussel farming has made to their local economy . #% We must also take account of cases of cancellation or long delays due to valid technical reasons for safety . #% Mr President , I share the concerns of my colleague , Mr Maat . #% Contrary to received wisdom , global sugar consumption already outstrips demand . #% in writing . - MEP Queiró has responded to the Commission 's communication ` An Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation ' and has highlighted several areas where policy considerations for the non-commercial air transport sector in general and business aviation have additional impact . #% Turning briefly to the content of Mr Linkohr 's report and the way in which we expect that money to be spent - and remember this is co-decision - some of the European Parliament 's priorities are reflected in Mr Linkohr 's report : our wish for landmines to be investigated , for inter-modal transport , educational multimedia and , in particular , renewable energy - and I must make it clear that the Committee on Budgets made it a condition that a proportion of that extra money would be spent on renewable energy . #% I also welcome the fact that we have a press release from the Commission on this . #% I am especially satisfied that the European LIFE programme has promoted the use of cleaner technologies and has also financially supported many waste recycling programmes . #% . The ` European Year of People with Disabilities ' raises awareness of the concerns of over 40 million people in the EU with disabilities . #% In my view we are now prepared to resort to extreme measures and I accept Commissioner Byrne ' s view that in the present situation they are the minimum necessary . #% I want to thank too the Commissioner whose name is well known in the border regions and in Northern Ireland and who has made a remarkable contribution to bringing the spirit of European goodwill and cooperation into that divided community . #% Apart from its obvious educational dimension , Socrates has provided a sense of belonging and an opportunity for young people to share and enjoy the cultural diversity of the European Union and its Member States . #% The Green Group can not , however , agree that nuclear energy is safe or an acceptable replacement for oil . #% In the light of the fact that the Dounreay nuclear plant is now being closed because of the public health risks to the operations being carried out there , the Irish Sea must not be used as a dumping ground for nuclear waste materials from the Sellafield plant . #% We call on the Commission to put together a voluntary code of conduct , working with rather than lecturing to companies operating in repressive countries , in an effort to reduce the capacity to prevent freedom of expression . #% The enduring environmental damage caused by the disaster demonstrates that Member States acting alone are under-resourced and ill-prepared to face such disasters . #% Since its inception the European Union has always been based upon the values of solidarity and community . #% People need to be extremely careful how they treat other people in this Chamber . #% Rural development is not just an adjunct ; it is not just an add-on to compensate for falling numbers in agriculture , though it may well help to achieve that . #% Foreign armies must be withdrawn and such wealth as exists in Afghanistan should be taken from the hands of the Karzai government , corrupt landlords and warlords and put democratically in the hands of organisations of peasants , workers and the poor to really utilise those resources and develop them for the benefit of the people . #% At the same time , there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread . #% In my own Member State , Ireland , for example , there is no law governing embryonic stem cell research . #% I have seen letters from small companies across Europe which are supportive of this directive . #% Given the major changes in the political context in which it operates , especially as the enlargement process gains momentum , it is time to evaluate and update elements of it as we prepare for its third phase . #% The initiatives mentioned in Mr Varela 's report are very good ones , but the report does not get rid of the remaining problems , especially the overfishing of several species such as bigeye and bluefin tuna , as well as the unacceptable amount of by-catch involving a wide number of species taken via so-called FAD fishing -- the favoured method used by EU vessels . #% I fully welcome the initiative taken by my government which has commissioned a study into the possible use of new , alternative forms of waste management and disposal . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I should like to speak briefly in support of this motion from the PPE-DE Group and the ALDE Group . #% But , in giving away those individual rights and freedoms , we also expect the same responsibility on the part of those in power . #% It is clear that piracy has now reached epidemic proportions in Europe and poses severe risks to consumer health and safety , with fake toys , medicines and spare parts coming into the EU . #% However , the value of the benefit in changing a microchip identification number in a pet animal is unlikely to ever be so great as to warrant the effort and the cost involved . #% That is the rule as adopted by the Bureau without any consultation with Parliament on those rules . #% Mr President , I want to refer to the issue of salmon prices and thank Parliament for its solidarity on this issue over the years . #% The compromise is that both Parliament and the Council have agreed on a qualified health professional . #% I appeal to the House to consider this when voting tomorrow . #% In principle the Liberal Group believes this is wrong and in practice we will not be a rubber stamp . #% A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate . #% In accordance with the precautionary principle and as a measure to promote consumer confidence , a policy of zero tolerance of processed animal proteins and meat and animal bonemeal in animal feed was put in place . #% Measures such as enhanced levels of consultation and mechanisms to quicken the resolution of disputes need to be investigated . #% It is only reasonable that the Community should adopt modern technology which will keep pace with what is happening in other sectors . #% I congratulate President Barroso on his stance immediately after the vote in trying to encourage the governments to keep their nerve , to take a long-term vision , to use the same kind of ideology and the same kind of selfless desire to see an improvement for all the people of Europe that the founding fathers of the European Union showed when Europe rose from the ashes of the Second World War . #% Mr President , my Group voted against this agreement . #% However , Turkey still has a long way to go . #% Mr President , in one minute you can say very little but I concur with what Mr van Orden , Mrs Kinnock and many of the other speakers have said . #% Very often a laugh is no harm in this Chamber , and you have given us a few this evening . #% I congratulate the Commission on taking legal action against the Atlantic Dawn , but I would now like to hear from the Commission the latest on this case . #% We need to know what it was that made the fatal difference . #% On the subject of roll call votes , on a personal basis and on behalf of a few other Members of this House , I wish to make the following statement to you and have the matter checked . #% There is a saying of the Chinese that if you love your child send him on a journey . #% The marching season is not over in Northern Ireland yet . #% 
I welcome the Commission 's proposal to encourage public procurement of clean and efficient vehicles , including using high biofuel blends . #% Therefore , if Ireland were to ratify the Schengen Agreement without the United Kingdom , we would impose new restrictions on the movement of Irish people which would create great difficulties . #% When we talk about the precautionary approach , Mr Blokland is wrong . #% Nonetheless I welcome the rapporteur 's support for the principles of Community preference , financial solidarity and a single market , and his warnings about price cuts . #% There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids . #% If we believe in a social-market Europe rather than in a supermarket Europe , we should not allow Mr McCreevy near the economic levers of this Union . #% I have come to the conclusion , having had a lot of experience in Parliament and with European affairs , that things have been steadily improving and that 1998 was one of the best performances we had . #% However , giving an inch in terms of flexibility does not mean countries are allowed to take a mile in terms of widening fiscal deficits . #% All of us must be concerned with the continuing decline of rural populations , the deteriorating age profile of our farmers and the real threat to the traditional family farm . #% The growth of this industry in some Member States is to be applauded , but it must be acknowledged that some Member States have provided less financial support than others . #% In the light of the proposals on better government that came out last week , which Mr Harbour mentioned , I want to ask you three specific questions . #% Minister Lowry must explain what the likely effect of the liberalization of gas markets will be on consumer prices . #% The prevention of the use of the European financial system as a money-laundering route for terrorism must continue to be a priority for our Union . #% We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2.2 billion . #% Mr President , I should like to start with a little irreverence which only your Irish colleagues can take the liberty of doing . #% The Austrian Presidency has proven over the last few months that when you deal with a particular issue in a certain way you can achieve success . #% I regret very much that the changes which the Convention could have made to the Euratom Treaty were not seized upon -- in great cowardice -- by Member States and by the Convention . #% These instruments have proven popular with consumers and producers alike . #% Only 700 000 of the 6 million who needed antiretrovirals could access that treatment . #% It is very important that a declaration is agreed by all European Union leaders , spelling out in unequivocal terms that Ireland 's military neutrality will be respected now and in the future . #% However , I also realise that it is necessary to have cuts in order to ensure that we have sufficient resources for this generation and , indeed , future generations . #% As a result of this investment , which I fully support , the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 % . #% It is for the Member States to decide whether they will build or not build nuclear power plants . #% And there is one person who has played an integral part in all this , Senator George Mitchell , whose contribution to the peace process is immeasurable . #% In some cases the children are never found . #% Sinn Féin supported the report to lend our weight in the European Parliament to this call . #% draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . - Mr President , I should begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his very positive speech , and on everything he is doing in this area . #% Our strategy was clear - more money for research . #% Maybe an onus on banks to put up notices in all their branches displaying these rules and regulations could be one way . #% I would like to see the Safeguards Office getting all the resources it needs to continue to do its job to the fullest extent possible , particularly with accession countries coming in . #% The Commissioner is certain pioneering a very practical approach to agriculture and rural development . #% There is an old saying : give a man a fish , you feed him for a day ; teach a man to fish , you feed him for life . #% Since the number of people who reach old age is increasing , the absolute number of suicides is expected to rise . #% The genuine work that has been done is , as has been said , a PR exercise -- a whitewash exercise . #% It is totally immoral that we should increase the prosperity of the European Union at the expense of the people of developing countries . #% Finally , there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address . #% That is why I do not support it . #% I have said before that the Euratom Treaty was a very efficient way of promoting nuclear energy , on which we have varied views . #% That is what has driven innovation to date and has propelled forward the information society and the state of the art . #% Given the coincidence of each Member State 's separate and collective interests and the role of the Commission in the domain of international trade , this is classically the type of legislation that is more suited to the European Union than a multiplicity of bilateral Member State arrangements . #% The enlargement of the Union is the number one policy priority of all key European Union legislators . #% However , the fears about public services , regulation and extension and the fact that the developing countries do not have the capacity for the administration that an opening-up of service markets will require all mean that the implications of opening up trade in services need to be very fully assessed . #% We have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living . #% The overall objective of nearly all the amendments is undeniably dangerous . #% I understand the final meeting is to take place today . #% We in the EU have failed to do that in Ireland over 25 years . #% These programmes are funded by both government and industry . #% Elsewhere the Presidency commends the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the observer mission for assuring a widely secure and free election day . #% Incidentally he was aided by the present Commissioner Padraig Flynn who was a member of the cabinet in Ireland at that time . #% When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts . #% Patent protection must be excluded from such experimentation . #% Mr President , I am from a country with a constitution that enshrines the truth about fundamental human rights : the truth that they are part of human nature and essential to human dignity ; the truth that a supreme being , not a mere human institution , gave these rights to us -- all of us without exception . #% I want to congratulate , of course , especially John Hume for the immense investment he has made in time and sacrifice in this Agreement . #% It is not right that one in four people below the age of 25 have difficulty in getting a decent start in life . #% The Khmer Rouge regime was one of the worst human rights abusers of the twentieth century , being responsible for an estimated 1.72 million deaths in a short , four-year rule . #% Lets put an end once and for all to our disgraceful record of broken promises and half-measures . #% Liberalisation is certainly inevitable ; it has got to come . #% I hope that Member States will see fit to transpose all elements of this important directive before the final deadline for implementation in order to give parents , as consumers , greater peace of mind . #% The current critical situation of many stocks makes it more urgent now than ever , not merely to roll out the 6 to 12 mile access regime which is totally inadequate , but rather to roll out the exclusive zone to 24 miles if we are serious about conserving stocks . #% There is a cardiac condition known as Chernobyl heart , where young children who should be full of health and full of life suffer severe heart attacks and strokes because of the impact of radiation and the fallout they have in their own systems . #% Most experts anticipate that if fusion is ever to achieve commercialisation it will not be for at least another 50 years . #% This communication points to a path for developing future policy . #% Northern Ireland is demonstrably ungoverned and may be ungovernable under the present structures . #% We have made such complicated regulations that I do not believe they are helpful to the regions they are intended for , and they create immense opportunities for the sort of abuses that have been identified here and which we hope will be corrected . #% However , when it comes to the crunch -- when a treasury may face large claims -- does the regulator protect the market or protect the investor ? #% Anyone who has taken the time to look at the exhibition must have been impressed by one of his statements and I quote , `` For me the world is not made up of nations , but of people . '' #% 
Many companies moved away from these archaic practices years ago and the overwhelming majority of consumers want an immediate ban . #% What do the employers do , line up their employees on a Monday morning and check their skin types and whether they have been overexposed at the weekend ? #% In addition , Mrs Wallis has asked us to look at a technical legal issue related to the ` cross-border ' definition . #% Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission . #% We should stop referring to them as Protestants , Catholics or Muslims : they are political extremists . #% I personally agree that taxation is the responsibility of the individual Member State . #% One of the primary challenges now for the European Union and the broader international community is to ensure that there is a resumption of an active and effective mediation process within the Middle East . #% I am very pleased with that . #% Commissioner , as one of the busiest commissioners it is a matter of some fascination to me that this particular directive should come out of the pile , given the workload you have . #% We really need to tighten up our regulations . #% They are entitled to have their taxes protected but the best way to protect the taxpayers and the taxpayers ' interests is at the national level . #% I would not like to be in this building at midnight on 31 December - a mere 43 days from now . #% There is a difference between animals that are going for slaughter and animals that are continuing their journey , and there is a difference between cattle , sheep and pigs . #% In the Russian Federation , they have collected data discussed at the Minsk Conference showing significant rates of cancer and leukaemia are dose-related - which means radiation-induced . #% Therefore , mandatory data collection on the impact of economic activities by Member States is necessary . #% If the European Union is to further multilateral approaches to global challenges , its Member States must act coherently and consistently at the UN level , particularly in light of the forthcoming review conferences for the Millennium Development Goals and the Non-Proliferation Treaty , as well as the review of the Human Rights Council 's status and working methods . #% Fish is caught to be sold on the market and therefore there is great scope , via the markets , to improve the efficiency of the CFP as well as promoting its conservation goals . #% All speakers in this Parliament are entitled to speak in their mother tongue whether that language is spoken by many or by few . #% The centre of gravity of this regulation is indisputably environmental protection , which would warrant an environment base -- an approach of minimum harmonisation . #% One issue which clearly needs to be addressed in the context of the war in Afghanistan relates to the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people . #% This can not be the bottom line for us in the future . #% This is a concern I have across all of our legislation and it is perhaps something that the Commissioner might address in the short time she has available to her . #% In my personal experience in Ireland , I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality . #% We share with you , Mr Spring , your assertion that the primacy of politics must be reclaimed and restored , and support your efforts in this regard . #% In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation . #% It is necessary to acknowledge that 98 % was properly spent . #% We had the opportunity of meeting you in the lead-up to the presidency and we found our working relationship with you quite cordial . #% This text will thus receive maximum support and will give credibility to Parliament in the build-up to the EU-US Summit at the end of June . #% We should keep control of legislative decisions in this political arena -- even if it means conciliation it is still political control -- rather than letting the courts decide on legislation for us . #% Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people , but of the broader international community . #% The efforts of all involved in this great institution need to be duly recognised and lauded . #% I hope all Members will support this report tomorrow , along with the two amendments in it , as we need a majority vote . #% Mr President , we need cleaner energy and more efficient technologies and , in order to achieve that , we need incentives -- negative incentives , if you like -- such as a carbon tax . #% Events in Hong Kong after the hand-over in July later this year will be pivotal and revealing as to the role that mainland China intends to play in the region . #% Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT . #% Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport , including full clinical examination of every animal . #% Regional diversities must be recognized in all policy-making . #% The reason I put this question to the Council was to try and establish whether the Council and the European Union can put more emphasis on education , because in developing countries if you have the three basics - reading , writing and arithmetic - even at the simplest level , you can challenge the village elders and the leaders in your community . #% In addition , efforts should now be made to refute the misleading and inaccurate arguments that are sometimes advanced by the opponents of the single currency . #% The citizens of Europe are unfortunately growing older and EU governments are going to have to be innovative to ensure that public and private pension programmes are both supported and protected . #% My Question 39 is one simple sentence and all I require is one simple answer . #% However , as a follow-up to what he has already stated , does the presidency feel that the operation of the Compensation Commission on Iraq , which is based in Geneva , should continue ? #% We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union . #% Security issues are always best addressed collectively . #% Why is Sinn Féin / IRA not helping it on the ground to get justice within its own community ? #% However , only the naive would fail to recognise it as part of a jigsaw for an integrated European criminal justice system , leading ultimately to the subservience of our national systems , not least in the vital area of how we should be free to tackle terrorism . #% I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid . #% I also recall the President-in-Office of the Council saying that at Kyoto we agreed on concrete reduction targets and greenhouse gas emissions by the industrialized countries . #% So what are the solutions to the problem ? #% I do not support the militarisation of Europe . #% We can not remain immune to the fact that the coming generation of young people is also fascinated and involved with the electronic media and perhaps need to have brought home to them again and again by their elders and betters the genuine pleasures of the printed word and the need to protect it , albeit with such small programmes as this . #% The United Nations has an opportunity - as is made clear by the inspectors who have reported to it this week - to peacefully disarm Saddam Hussein if they are given enough time and providing Saddam Hussein pro-actively cooperates with them . #% Some of the hardest criminals are turning witness and are now offered very lenient sentences . #% Reference intake values are the accepted scientific norm today and should be used to ensure that labelling is clear , unambiguous and meaningful ; they would greatly facilitate consumer choice , not least as a tool to fight obesity . #% As far as the mobile air conditioning or MAC Directive is concerned , I am of the opinion that a balance has to be struck between , on the one hand , being technology-prescriptive in relation to the global warming potential of the gases to be allowed according to the directive and , on the other hand , promoting the development of alternative environmental technologies . #% In Ireland , the nitrates directive , for example , is beginning to bite and having such serious consequences that the farming organisations have withdrawn from the government-sponsored social and economic partnership talks . #% Their livelihoods were endangered . #% Politically we believe that this Commission is dead in the water . #% There is a danger that the current unprecedented crises in the livestock sector - mainly BSE and foot-and-mouth - might be used to introduce far-reaching reforms to the common agricultural policy which would not otherwise have been contemplated . #% Demographics , infrastructure , size and isolation make it very difficult for Ireland to meet the same targets and deadlines as other countries . #% Madam President , today 's debate is welcome , necessary and timely . #% I want to go back to the area of the correlation tables . #% I underline what Ms Jackson said to us , on the Commission 's recent communication on the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste , published in May 2003 . #% Of course this is not something that we can act on alone and we hope we will win the support of other Member States for this approach . #% I believe everybody in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs Smith in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years . #% There has been a clear shift in the public mindset in relation to recycling in Ireland . #% 
I requested in my 2008 letter to Commissioner Kyprianou that the original recommendation be revised , as it was then four years overdue for revisions , but there have still been no updates . #% Vision and political will have brought us to the threshold of launching the euro in 71 days ' time . #% All of these agreements have human rights clauses . #% Therefore , every possible effort must be made to destroy it and also the related crime of money-laundering . #% I emphasise child labour because I was recently involved in a report in that area and I am very conscious of that . #% When you talk about such things it is difficult to believe that they can happen but without monitoring or checks you can not be quite sure that they do . #% Can the Commissioner tell me what the Commission intends to do about that ? #% In Martti Ahtisaari 's proposals we have an opportunity to take that big step , to take that jump , to find not just the peace but also the justice within it . #% The battle to defeat the scourge of trafficking in human beings must be tackled at European Union level in a coordinated and structured manner . #% Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go . #% It is not his first visit to Strasbourg - he has been here on quite a number of occasions to prepare the groundwork in a careful way for a successful presidency , which I very much hope and am sure will emerge . #% I think you would acknowledge , Commissioner , that the Court of Justice decision against the French Government was a landmark decision which will help you pursue the policy you agreed at the Amsterdam Summit . #% This is just one more example of the way that the Irish government is behaving in relation to its obligations under EU directives . #% Firstly , that tourism as an employment growth area be recognized . #% Hopefully , the EU will get the nerve to say to China , ` we love you , we will trade with you , but we will not cooperate with you or say you are right when you are wrong ' . #% The only way we will do that is if we give the social dimension of Europe - the social convergence that is needed in Europe - the same status as we give to monetary convergence and to economic convergence . #% Mrs Ries has also strongly continued the important process of naming and shaming toxic chemicals and seeking their eradication . #% Speed is now essential . #% Secondly , the Council will consider the report of the Intergovernmental Conference as a Council of Ministers and the various Member States will put forward their views . #% In areas of rapid technological progress , the European Union must make a special effort to avert any future barriers in the internal market as a result of conflicting national rules and establish a European legal framework at an early stage . #% On the issue of imperialism , it is quite clear in paragraph 4 of this document that ` the purpose of a common defence policy is to protect the Union 's interest in all areas , including security of supply ' . #% Last night I heard Jeremy Paxman on saying that the reform of the sugar regime in Europe was the most disreputable and inefficient form of subsidy given to farmers in Europe and is harming farmers in developing countries . #% After the democratic transition in Serbia , the Union lifted its sanctions to repeal the oil embargo against Serbia and the Union lifted flight bans . #% There is absolutely no point in throwing further funds into the bottomless pit of economic collapse in Russia , especially when there is continued political maladministration and corruption . #% They are difficult to read in small species such as the cat , they are difficult to read in breeds where the ears are cropped , they are difficult for regulatory officers to read in aggressive or apprehensive individuals and they are relatively easy to erase and to change fraudulently . #% As Rapporteur on EU ETS I am only too well aware of the critical role of research and the need to nurture the talent and minds available to solve the considerable climate challenges with which we are faced . #% Eleven countries have not signed the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings . #% I come back to the issue of the Irish Box . #% We need to make sure that the laws are fully implemented so that the children abandoned and in care receive the proper treatment they deserve . #% A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or demerits of staging posts in general , and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that staging posts remain . #% However , the thrust of this proposal would improve the functioning of the single market and , crucially , would greatly assist in our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions , without compromising the ability of any country to levy its own taxes . #% I believe that this new single EU-wide credit card format will also go a long way in combating driving licence tourism . #% As Mr Provan mentioned , the tourism industry is in further severe difficulty too after the crisis which followed the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease . #% To some extent this debate has now been superseded by the decision of the Heads of State to adhere to the decisions taken in Berlin . #% -- Mr President , some 15 years ago , as a young academic , I applied for and was offered a post at the Free University of Berlin . #% There is no mention of the fact that British Aerospace , for example , is responsible for arming Indonesia with Hawk jets so it can terrorise the people of East Timor . #% The mistake was not that the Pact was there , but that it was not enforced against other countries that continue to breach those guidelines and fail to observe the overall policies on the proper management and operation of economies and fiscal policies . #% The most vital requirement of energy and environmental policy as we approach the millennium is to meet our Kyoto commitments , and here of course a CO2 tax would have a major role to play . #% There is absolutely no reason why the Commission should not buy into that code of good administrative behaviour , so that we would have a common code for all three institutions . #% The structural funds should be maintained at their present size for the 15 Member States until the objective of creating a level playing field throughout the Union has been achieved . #% In the Member States there already exist the most stringent systems of checking on animals for transport , particularly those on long-haul journeys , and rightly so . #% European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry . #% You will see from today 's report that what was Amendment No 3 has been penned over as 4 . #% It was a historic occasion . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this very comprehensive report . #% I would ask Commissioner Flynn to join with me in urging the Irish Government to coordinate its efforts with the efforts being made here in Europe . #% Either all countries comply with the rules and have confidence in the system or we will have a credibility problem with regard to the issue for an indefinite period . #% At that meeting the Members of the European Civil Aviation Council ( ECAC ) present were told by their legal advisor that they could not proceed under the ICAO Agreement as requested by Airbus and so Airbus persuaded the Commission to legislate where ECAC could not . #% Consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this House to let all Members see what is going on . #% Progress on these issues may be hindered by developments on the ground , such as the expansion of settlements or terrorist attacks . #% This assistance includes help for educational programmes , reconciliation schemes , the provision of shelters for refugees , constructing border crossing-points as well as supporting infrastructure projects such as the building of roads and the clearing of the Danube river of pollutants . #% Again , there has been a very massive growth in cross-border child pornography . #% However , they should withdraw this proposal , return to the drawing-board and ensure there is mandatory self-handling which would provide for prior authorisation and would include criteria relating to employment , the social aspects , professional qualifications and environmental considerations . #% Thank you again to all concerned . #% I can assure the Members of this House that in doing so , the French National Front was abusing the Irish flag and everything it stands for . #% Coming from a region that depends heavily on the fishing industry , I want to refer to Commissioner Byrne ' s proposals on dioxin levels . #% I would like to comment on the recommendations in the report that a tax be imposed on arms exports . #% Today , when the British farmers have a major problem , are we going to change the rules of the game and refuse to give the British farmers the assistance to which they are entitled under the Treaties ? #% I therefore fully support the compromise proposal to be brought forward tomorrow because it is important that we act with some urgency on this issue . #% We welcome this study very much and hope that the Council will now conduct a wide-ranging debate , both within the Council itself and with other sectors of society , about these EU fisheries agreements . #% They are living in the past , looking through rose-tinted glasses and looking back to a time that no longer exists . #% We see examples of this across Europe . #% In my own city , Dublin , we have seen whole communities devastated by the scourge of drugs . #% The EU has a role to play in promoting best management practice that suits the needs of local actors and communities , and in incentivising forestation efforts compatible with local conditions and native species . #% As the UN General Assembly said today when adopting its declaration against the cloning of human beings , measures need to be taken to prevent the exploitation of women in the application of life sciences . #% Biofuels must be introduced , targets met and the work of Member States ' governments strictly monitored and evaluated . #% 
Currently there is a nuclear shipment from La Hague in France wandering around the planet between France and Japan . #% Such a system will also promote the convergence and coordination of the different national legal systems and enable parties to check on the status of trading partners and suppliers , especially in an age of on-line trading . #% We need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify . #% Programmes will not start on 1 January 2000 , but we need to minimise delays in order not to fall into the problems and traps of the previous round of funding where late starts led to problems of underspends , delays in projects , project cancellations and difficulties in sustaining matched funding . #% But , as several speakers have already said , we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country . #% I am concerned that this agreement in its current unamended form will allow European boats ( including Irish boats ) to fish in the waters of Western Sahara , a territory illegally occupied by Morocco . #% I am happy to support the motion on the floor today which will ensure that these rights are supported - the rights of parents to raise their children , and the rights of children to that protection and support . #% -- Mr President , I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak briefly on what has been an appalling tragedy in north-western Pakistan , Afghanistan , India and predominantly the Kashmir region . #% It seems a long time ago , but it still remains in our memories . #% As has already been highlighted by other speakers within this Parliament , there are a number of contradictions and elements within this combined report which will cause us difficulties in the future . #% Aquaculture and agriculture are totally different sectors that must be addressed separately . #% The past 10 days have been a watershed , a defining moment for the peace process . #% It is not acceptable that these implants should be advertised as simple and straightforward , with no indication that there are medical risks involved . #% I urge the Commission to carry out an evaluation in these two areas to see if there is more potential in them as initiatives in the field of agricultural activity . #% We should remember that at the moment , within the limits of the money available to us in the financial perspectives , we could raise a further ECU 10b for next year 's budget . #% In Belgium and France , emergency repairs can only be done after an eight-day prior notification , which is a contradiction in itself . #% That is what we all want to do . #% We enter this new round of talks with the benefits of hindsight and in the knowledge that the United States , in reaching its negotiating position , will have , as in the past , researched the hidden agenda of establishing ways to deviate from that agreement to help its own producers , while at the same time demanding that Europe adhere rigidly to its requirements . #% Once again the Kosovo crisis exposes the gap between aspiration and outcome . #% By April 2005 , the H5N1 virus had also moved to pigs . #% Similarly , in terms of the employment generated , preference should be given to vessels which provide most jobs relative to the amount of fish they catch . #% We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied , to a certain extent , to the kind of things that we can achieve . #% If it had been in the text itself it might have been legally binding . #% In my view , nothing can be done without bringing both minorities along . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Blokland for his report which strives to improve the Commission 's proposal , and the authors of the other amendments which do so as well . #% Words are easy , what we need now is for the roadmap to be implemented . #% Nevertheless , the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme will be of very real value and I look forward to its adoption following the Commissioner 's declaration , and to a vote tomorrow which I hope will be very well supported by a European Parliament that will follow the programme with great interest . #% I totally support this Joint Motion . #% I have attempted to produce balanced legislation that takes account of the needs of all sectors of the industry , not just one vocal sector that is against this directive . #% Mr President , I wish to thank the President-in-Office for the information he has given . #% On the question of cross-references between a Council political declaration and the regulations , the Liberal Group agrees that those references should be minimal . #% The primary objective of the Cotonou Agreement is the reduction and , eventually , the eradication of poverty in a way consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy . #% This is particularly so where efforts are made to cross-reference scientific data with fisheries observations . #% Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions . #% Setting up a system that allows for safety and civil aviation authorities to share information available from the different reporting schemes will enable all parties involved learn from their mistakes thereby producing a safer system for all air users in future . #% Why is it that the McCartney family has to go to Washington , Brussels , Strasbourg , London and other places to get justice when , in its own community , it is not being properly represented by the people who say they represent it -- Sinn Féin / IRA ? #% The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum , they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting , which goes on continuously , in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I hope that we are on the way to a first reading agreement . #% In advance of the Commission 's report on the implementation of the original directive next June , I can report that a sensible policy of realistic derogation has already proved a success in my own country , and I hope Mrs Jackson will take note of what I am about to say . #% Its introduction would damage Europe 's capacity to attract foreign direct investment , because the rules as such would not apply to the Member State in which it was located but would be by some reference to a complicated formula which can only be calculated in retrospect , which would damage our capacity to attract foreign direct investment . #% My party is committed to this goal and will work with other parties in a constructive and positive way to achieve this . #% As a person who has always encouraged the promotion and safeguarding of lesser-used regional languages , I am pleased that this has been included in the report as a proposed amendment to Article 151 of the Treaty . #% It brings the Commission and the European project into disrepute with citizens who are otherwise not Eurosceptic at all . #% So the single market gives benefit to the Dutch and Germans . #% I welcome the general thrust of the proposal and share the aims which underpin it . #% I call on those Member States which , for political reasons , are continuing to block the lifting of the ban , to start looking at the objective , scientific evidence . #% We have heard already today how important it is to have a legal base in energy with reference to renewable energies . #% So there is a huge time-bomb waiting to go off , if , first of all , these landfill sites are not covered by the directive and have been closed down before it enters into effect and , secondly , if no action is taken to ensure that any landfill site is beyond a certain radius from residential areas . #% Indeed , this experimentation , under the guise of ` therapeutic cloning ' is already patented , and the object of ongoing research . #% It is being evaluated , fortunately , before we move on to SAVE II . #% Almost all of us know them off by heart , but Member States have so far taken very little action on them . #% I congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Berend once again on a job well done . #% In terms of the complete independence and discretion that should go with this high office , this latter quote is an important reassurance . #% Why , Taoiseach , has your government destroyed our sugar industry for an EU scheme , when Irish agriculture is struggling for survival and when we need biofuels like ethanol ? #% Mr President , despite the justified criticism of the shortness of time this is nevertheless an important occasion . #% I would like you to clarify that you are not supporting plutonium reprocessing of in these proposals . #% I will therefore vote against amendments , such as Amendment 49 tabled by Kathy Sinnott and others , which endanger embryonic stem cell research . #% Of course , Iceland , as a member of the EEA , has had a major advantage in that they have already adopted a significant part of the acquis . #% I am not calling for a police force for food , but it certainly looks as if we need something more than we currently have . #% It is inadequate in some respects because large areas of income are excluded . #% We can improve our resources . #% I thank Mr Papoutsis for his continuing work in this area . #% I believe , however , that KEDO was ill designed from the start , neither addressing North Korea 's immediate energy needs , nor delivering technology adaptable to the country 's infrastructure . #% We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland -- to the great relief of all of us . #% Mr President , Madam Commissioner , I have , as you know , used every available opportunity in this Parliament to raise the matter of the sugar industry . #% The common agricultural policy has been radically reformed , and this morning 's vote basically gives truth to the lie that if we reduced all EU agriculture subsidies the poor in Africa would be better off . #% 
I note that the Spanish Presidency took the initiative to organise a special Informal Council of Tourism Ministers . #% Our wheaten and soda breads are must-taste delicacies and Armagh Bramley apples have a very distinct reputation . #% It now seems increasingly likely that a significant number of the Member States will opt to establish the single currency in three years time . #% Our rapporteur has already mentioned a couple of them in his own speech and in his report . #% Asking directions of a gentleman I passed , I was told ` well , I would n't start from over here ' . #% However , the preventive measures that have been put in place such as the ban on meat-and-bone meal should , on scientific evidence , see the elimination of BSE and its threat to human health . #% We need to get a grip on proliferation , and in this context the trade in nuclear technology undertaken by the EU is similar to the trade in heroin in that it is equally lethal . #% I have many reasons for saying this , but time allows me to mention just one today . #% Campaigns such as the one million roofs , the one hundred solar communities and the golden sun awards are visionary ways of making renewables real to people on the ground and I know that they will be very interesting if we can actually pursue them in a practical way . #% He made sure that his friends in the horse racing business did not have to pay tax on six-figure-a-go stud fees . #% This means that educational training in the field of information technology is also changing all the time . #% Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely . #% I presume the planes will not be able to get here either . #% A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country , Ireland . #% I believe , in the light of the spirit of cooperation and determination that prevails at this moment , that an agreement can be reached at the forthcoming meeting of the heads of the European Union governments . #% The Atlantic Dawn and the Veronica are landing in Las Palmas . #% Our European partners have declared that the Nice Treaty does not impose any defence commitments on any Member State of the European Union . #% The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief . #% A prerequisite is the necessary information sharing with all parties . #% We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme . #% As a so-called civilised country , it totally ignores international opinion on this issue . #% Incidents such as the kidnapping in Southwest France by the ETA organisation are a test of the process . #% The House set up a group which reports to the House and we have a general political debate . #% Our support for the humanitarian effort needs to be translated into practical action . #% If the Court of Auditors can not control this sort of leakage , well who can we expect to control anything in the European Union ? #% Firstly , and perhaps most importantly , this report must set the agenda for Parliament and must be a guide for Parliament when it tries to influence both the Commission and the Council with regard to the direction they should be taking on thematic issues and the priority the European Union gives to human rights . #% That kind of language is inflammatory and dangerous . #% The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services , capital , goods and persons . #% It has a much higher incidence among the dairy herds , than the suckler herds , probably because the dairy men could afford more concentrates traditionally over the years . #% It is simply unfair . #% That means that this particular recommendation should not yet be linked to the health programmes but should be considered alongside them . #% Since the introduction of standards which can be specified in legislation , as done in the UK pet statute , all ISO standard readers can read all ISO standard microchips . #% The whole country and I am sure the whole of Europe would appreciate it if you would communicate to the Irish media and , in particular , the editor of the Irish Independent newspaper in Dublin , our deep sympathy and our continuing support for freedom of speech and guaranteeing the protection of democracy . #% It was the Committee on Budgetary Control of Parliament which began years ago to insist that we should give , as parliamentarians , this report the weight that it deserves . #% Mr President , the principles of integrated coastal zone management are accepted worldwide as a mechanism to enable sustainable management of coastal areas . #% While I welcome the substance of what this proposal aims to do , for the reasons I have outlined in relation to the legal basis , I and my Irish colleagues will be voting against the report . #% Mr President , the Århus Convention , signed by all 25 Member States , gives the public rights in the three areas of accessing environmental information , participating in environmental decision-making and accessing justice in environmental matters . #% I admire Mr Cook for his condemnation of the slaughter in Kosovo . #% I would like it to be on the record that while I support the overall objective of Parliament 's resolution on the Spring Summit 2006 , I do not support amendments which state that nuclear energy is a viable alternative to Europe 's current energy dependency . #% We need to start work on the longer term position of agriculture , vis-à-vis the present CAP reform end in 1999 and also the next WTO round . #% It is a recipe for feeding hatred , not for coming to terms with the awfulness of terrorism . #% Furthermore , the cowardice of EU Member States in refusing a visa to President Chen Shui-bian to visit Europe is self-serving and counterproductive . #% In other words , they should be available and capable of being sold in machines , supermarkets and other outlets . #% It is a situation which the European Union has addressed from time to time , but there is serious concern amongst human rights defenders , both in Colombia and in Europe , that the European Union is allowing this issue to slide off the agenda . #% It is completely unacceptable that it carries out the same barbaric acts as countries like Iran - it is basically in the same category as Iran . #% Coming from Northern Ireland , I can speak from an experience of a like terrorist organisation -- the IRA -- also securing an electoral base . #% While any declaration from the Commission in this context is non-binding , it may play a role in the purpose of interpretation of the ECJ on this subject , if perchance this legislation , which has already spanned two legislatures , gets a fourth reading at the Court in Luxembourg , as was my concern from the start . #% The real pressure must be applied at home where the people who permitted and tolerated these actions will feel it . #% Time and time again he has led them forward by the nose and time and time again they have allowed him to get away with it . #% We now report in the follow-up , in our comment on the Commission 's response . #% It betrays those in Pakistan who risk their lives to defend human rights and democracy . #% Why have a section , under other questions -- part three -- which should have had half an hour , and then ignore it ? #% In this sense , the people of sub-Saharan Africa can take inspiration from their brothers and sisters in Tunisia in their heroic struggle against a corrupt dictatorship over the past weeks . #% The Parliament resolution does not make reference to this , but I would like to put on record that concurrent to trafficking in adults , there is growing trafficking in children for prostitution and paedophile activities . #% The United States report suggests that legalisation there would lead to around a 100 % increase in heroin consumption and around a 50 % increase in that of cocaine . #% Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage . #% In addition , we must ensure that the list of specialities included in the proposal is comprehensive enough to ensure due recognition and regulatory protection is accorded to emerging disciplines , such as medical oncology -- the whole area of the research and treatment of cancer . #% It lacks the characteristics of good tax law , which should be simple to understand , easy to collect , predictable in its statutory implications and difficult to evade . #% Can I first of all welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work in bringing forward this report ? #% I was talking to someone a few days ago who had been to one of these illegal race tracks in Spain , where they found nine greyhounds from Ireland racing on a course in appalling conditions . #% Several scientific studies on the matter have been published in recent years , however , none of them have provided clear evidence on possible effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless technology on human health . #% We all know that the accession of ten new countries is not an easy task . #% The major achievement of the Irish presidency was to secure agreement on a Treaty that establishes a Constitution for Europe but , allied to this , a key priority was to communicate Europe better to its citizens . #% Since the recommendation , we have seen scientific research and conclusions change and evolve as well as significant technological developments using EMFs such as WiFi and Bluetooth . #% Following our government 's announcement last night of a new multi-party national forum to explain and discuss the European project in general and Nice in particular , I hope a more informed , reassured Irish electorate will allow our government to ratify the Nice Treaty in the next twelve months or so . #% I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive . #% 
Mr President , I too share the view of the previous speakers that the summit of European Union leaders was a success across a number of fronts . #% EU enlargement will be another central theme at the Helsinki Summit . #% To achieve this we will require radical rethinking of how we have conducted our relations to date within the Commission and Parliament . #% It seems to me to be a total waste of valuable intelligence that a lot of the educational facilities and fora are left out of the negotiations on new programmes . #% In the absence of an agreement directly with the trader or the trading site , the consumer should be encouraged to look at the benefits of ADRs . #% I am talking about a price in terms of money , in terms of trade and in terms of arms supplies . #% The Action for Growth initiative must also ensure that the research and development investment target of 3 % of GDP within the Union will be met by 2010 . #% It should also help local and regional authorities to develop networks to cooperate in the field of cultural tourism . #% Mr President , a feature of the current situation is the anger and the frustration of the men and women of all our Member States . #% Local authorities the length and breadth of Ireland are still engaging in the process of finding new landfill sites for the future waste disposal programmes . #% If the malpractice of torture is not challenged and reversed , then international laws designed to protect all humanity will be permanently degraded . #% The funding proposal for information policy is very positive , and the multiannual programme is a very practical proposal : it makes it easier for Member States and that is to be welcomed , as are the joint programmes by two Member States or border regions . #% We seem to be able to pursue the terrorists responsible for the horrific events of 11 September , but it seems to be beyond us to tackle international drug terrorists . #% I appeal to the House to make creative use of the possibility open to us , in setting our agenda , to recognise this substantive political requirement and to facilitate a debate at 3 p.m. and a vote at 6 p.m. or thereafter this evening . #% Could you address the realities in the different Member States , which must be of concern to the Council ? #% It also must be said that the recent remarks of Mr Prodi in the Irish media to the effect that enlargement can proceed even if Nice is not ratified , unfortunately adds to the confusion . #% The Maastricht Treaty allowed for the creation of Europol as an intelligence-gathering agency on the illegal drugs trade . #% We welcome the acceleration of the energy market , though there is a risk of that aim clashing with the aim of sustainable development . #% If you are not going to bring in flexibility with regard to the types of work that people want to reconcile the family and working life then you will be denying people , particularly women , the opportunity to work . #% The CEO of the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world EADS has actually bemoaned the fact that the US already invests six times more than Europe in armaments research and that while the research budgets in the US continue to rise , those in Europe stagnate . #% Secondly , establishing special labelling requirements for products which have been fully tested and found to be completely safe , seems wrong to me and makes bad law . #% The quality of the proceedings in the House , I believe , has restored some dignity to the appointment process which unfortunately , because of the prolonged and rather bitter exchanges on 2 May at the European Council , was rather marred at the outset . #% It is much more comprehensive and , indeed , I have to confess that I do not see as many simple answers to the questions raised in this one as in my Young Farmers ' organisation in Ireland 40 years ago . #% It sounds from his answer that they should have . #% Chairman Morillon and Vice-Chairman Miguélez Ramos both refuse the technocratic approach of rebuilding stocks at all cost , preferring instead to suggest ways to ensure that stocks remain within safe biological limits . #% Tens of thousands are still without shelter in inaccessible parts of Pakistan and Kashmir , and the freezing temperatures of winter are approaching . #% A recent study carried out by an organisation in my constituency called Cáirde points to the fact that 80 % of people who contract HIV in Ireland are in receipt of welfare payments . #% Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference -- and they were all highly educated , sophisticated women -- the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person . #% But this is also representative of a significant maturing in the European democratic process , with major institutional and constitutional implications . #% Proposals to improve the Capital Requirements Directive are therefore central to creating stable and responsible banks . #% Indeed , the largest voluntary association in Ireland is the Gaelic Athletic Association . #% I protested about this earlier today and Mr Cox , the President of Parliament , has written to Mr Pique I Camps requesting that my question and nine others be restored to the order paper . #% I quote one of the most famous Americans , Thomas Jefferson , when he said , ` I have never considered a difference of opinion in politics , in religion , in philosophy , as a cause for withdrawing from a friendship ' . #% Going back to the basics of economics , countries either meet this demand or it will be met elsewhere . #% In due course , within the House and in the appropriate fora , my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves , as Parliament , must learn from the hearings process . #% As the President of the Council will have responsibilities in the field of CFSP , this could conflict with the role of Foreign Minister and could cause confusion as to who authoritatively speaks for the EU in this field . #% The very fact that the law is still called the Package Travel Directive shows how outdated it is . #% We must also guarantee that the necessary staff training is put in place to make these changes work . #% I would join in your words of caution from the experience in Northern Ireland . #% I would like to ask the Commission whether the UK 's action is in breach of Article 19 ( 3 ) of the waste shipment regulation and Article 4 of the waste framework directive . #% However , as the Commissioner responsible for enlargement , he does not now have the luxury of speaking in a personal capacity . #% We have to remember that there is no such thing as a safe country for certain people . #% Glancing through a scientific report on the status of fish stocks makes for very depressing reading these days . #% If individual Member States were to expend the same effort and energy addressing the issue of how , as nations , to compete in a global market as they did in preparing showcase summits , then I suspect we might all see much more product . #% I am satisfied that our negotiators understand the extent of this challenge and - I hope - draw on the benefit of hindsight resulting from our experiences with the current regime . #% Mr President , I also want to say hello to the Taoiseach and thank him for his marvellous , spontaneous remarks here today . #% At a time when one would expect a scaling-down of nuclear enterprises in Britain , the British government has announced that the MOX nuclear facility can go ahead at Sellafield . #% I would like to think that in May we could give you a political mandate to act as formateur , to go from this House in May to begin to explore in substance , as formateur with a political mandate , what you might do . #% Therefore , Mr President , could you contact the editors concerned in the Independent Newspaper Group and ask them to carry a correction of the remarks you made ? #% The Irish Government is presently putting together a national development plan outlining our economic and social investment priorities for the seven-year period post-1999 . #% It would seem that for the US , the transatlantic relationship is simply one of convenience , to be used when it suits , but ignored when US policy and interests take priority . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I welcome this debate , which offers the opportunity to once again draw attention to the necessity of including and honouring child-labour provisions in all EU trade agreements . #% In your answer to me you say that the fiscal advantage to the air traveller will be very small . #% Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board . #% It is not easy to be in a situation of leadership , it takes a lot of courage . #% As several previous speakers have mentioned , they have been locked in dispute on what many of us would regard as one of the basic human rights , that of the workers to join a trade union and be represented by a trade union . #% So Mr Flynn , our Commissioner , is to be congratulated and I would urge Members to vote in support of the common position . #% The way to move forward is through cooperation and dialogue , and permanent peace must be established . #% It seems to me that a small family-owned farm , for example , which we could take as a base for rural development , etc. , is greatly endangered by the new movement that is occurring at the moment . #% I would like to pay tribute again to the rapporteur . #% We have had situations where , because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples , people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant . #% The hours that this dedicated group of individuals currently has to work in Ireland are unacceptably long . #% Would you not agree that the experience to date of the Posting of Workers Directive indicates that amendments are required in order to clarify the application of that directive to the delivery of services from third countries , such as Turkey , and also from some other Member States ? #% But at the Council meeting in December , the Council set 199 TACs in total . #% Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments . #% We urge you , both in choice of your Commissioners and in such an eventuality , to use your fullest powers under that Treaty and to demonstrate that indeed you are your own man . #% 
It is estimated that cooperatives in the consumer and production areas alone have over 78 million members in the Union . #% The challenge is to formulate a common fisheries policy which maintains jobs and fish stocks at the same time . #% I am going to concentrate on two frankly difficult areas - TRIPS and the environmental aspects of trade which you have already mentioned . #% So therefore what people really need to see is certainty . #% This whole point has a lot of merit . #% Some of the root causes of violence ( occupation , injustice , social and economic causes ) are barely mentioned . #% Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now , because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks . #% If we want enlightened social policies , in the European tradition , we need to reform our economies . #% Mr President , as Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel has said , research has consistently been identified as the key to improving economic growth , creating new jobs , a cleaner environment and better health . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Hyland for his report . #% As far as I am aware , arrangements with the Isle of Man and the similar jurisdictions mentioned by the honourable Member were dealt with at the time of accession and are not presenting any difficulties . #% Have states en route also the right to be informed and by whom ? #% Irish representatives , Finnish representatives , German representatives , Austrian representatives , French representatives must speak to people to tell them what is required . #% In my view , insurance companies should not fear the entry of other European competitors into their national markets . #% Terrorism occurs not only when people engage in suicide bombing , but also when members of the security forces operate outside the law . #% In conclusion , the need for across-the-board standardization of responses from the national reports is essential to get a fully clear picture for all of Europe . #% Transparency is , I believe , the key to European democracy and its main building block . #% We ask the Commission to prepare for a reduction if that proves necessary . #% This is the most unacceptable position for me . #% Madam President , on behalf of all my Irish colleagues I too condemn out of hand the savages who perpetrated this appalling atrocity on the citizens of Madrid this morning as they travelled to work and school . #% It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure the development of a coherent European strategy against organised crime . #% Mr President , Commissioner , fluorinated gases are a grave threat to our environment . #% All proposed amendments were already included in Parliament 's first reading position , which was adopted by plenary with a large majority on 21 October 2010 . #% It can not continue . #% I hope this House agrees that this is a value that Europe was built on . #% I want to mention that during the first year of the new President there were 260 public hangings , hundreds of secretly-executed political prisoners ; 7 people stoned to death in public , not to mention those stoned to death in secret . #% I would recommend that he do so . #% Such a step , regrettable as it is , would have been unnecessary if the political establishment in Ireland had made any effort to persuade voters to ratify it . #% In Ireland we have quite recently introduced recycling and there has been a very positive response from the general public . #% This is a war crime in my eyes . #% It would provide a financial incentive for the development of clean technologies that will safeguard the environmental heritage of future generations . #% They not only have the strong interest and support of citizens for their intrinsic value but they also have an important contribution to make to employment in our European regions . #% I protest , and I would like you , Mr Vice-President , to pass on my protestations to the President of Parliament . #% I welcome the fact that the Commission is investigating whether or not the general good clause is being misused . #% This report , in advance of the legislative proposal the Commission is preparing for the autumn , addresses these issues , calling for : a review of whether and how Member States use ratings for regulatory purposes in order to reduce the general over-reliance on them of the financial regulatory system ; a detailed impact assessment and viability study on the costs , benefits and potential governance structure of a fully independent European Credit Rating Foundation ; the exploration of establishing a truly independent European Credit Rating Agency ; the establishment of a European Rating Index which incorporates all ratings of registered CRAs that are available on the market . #% But we must structure society so that , if women wish to become mothers , they can actually do that and bring up their children without economic pressures that drive them out of the house when the baby is six weeks old . #% I am sorry to have to raise this issue , but it is becoming a bit of a problem for us , and I notice that quite a number of colleagues are concerned about it . #% in writing . - I support this report , which calls for the EU to promote the introduction of a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) at global level , and failing that , as a first step , the EU should implement an FTT at European level . #% Only a few years ago , Rosemarie Nelson , the mother of a young family , was assassinated by loyalist paramilitaries because she was a human rights lawyer . #% Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future . #% All too often , when we talk about globalisation , our comments and concerns centre solely on trade , rather than on the social aspects of globalisation . #% What we also have to do is make it possible for them to get to that position . #% The implementation of the Waste Management Act ( 1995 ) is certainly a step in the right direction . #% As slow and difficult as that is , it is the only way to find the just solution to this problem . #% Mr President , I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their initiative and tact in dealing with this situation . #% We can not force our wishes on other countries . #% This was despite the very low incidence of BSE in the province and our excellent traceability system , which is better than anywhere else in the whole European Union . #% Would honesty not require us to label our produce as ` Monsanto Corporation , produced in St Louis , Missouri ' ? #% I know it is in full sympathy with the views of this Parliament but it sees the draft document as a realistic or pragmatic acknowledgement of what is politically attainable at this stage . #% The EQF , by acting as a translation tool for national authorities , will undoubtedly help our constituents to overcome this senseless discrimination . #% The President of our own Parliament said here today that there are 56 different directives dealing with the sale and production of goods for supply and for services . #% In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe . #% It has been of immense advantage to my own country , Ireland and I know it will continue to be , in the future , a powerhouse for the citizens of Europe . #% But I am hopeful that if we can get overwhelming support for it here today the Council will , as a matter of urgency , adopt it without further delay . #% Mr President , I am the co-rapporteur for the excise report on mineral oils . #% In industrialised countries , domestic work accounts for between 5 and 9 % of all employment , with the vast majority of the people employed in that sector being women . #% I know her commitment to direct participation by the citizens . #% All of this is false . #% We are in real danger of adding an extra layer of victimization for many of these women who are being brought into the trafficking net by being offered work opportunities in the EU as au pairs , domestic workers or as waitresses . #% Each Member States has different needs because rural areas differ right across the 25 Member States . #% Madam President , my name is not on the register of attendance for yesterday , through nobody 's fault other than my own . #% It is revolting to see right-wing politicians scapegoating gay people in Lithuania . #% I would like to say that our Group very much supports this report . #% The problem with export refunds and the associated difficulty of developing third country markets had a bad impact on the profitability of the entire European beef sector . #% They are still paying that price today . #% We must also support the efforts of the African Union to monitor and , if necessary , enforce peace to protect civilians . #% 
However , the Treaty clearly defines that and narrows down that role , namely that it only operates for European law . #% We do not need to defer it any longer . #% Finally , some will say that we are standing on the edge looking into the abyss . #% The Liberal Group wants two things from the Commission : that it should , in the short - to medium-term , try to improve the problems and shortcomings of the current system ; also , it should continue to deepen its work on moving the system to a new regime using the point of origin . #% So , the sheepmeat policy is a very good one . #% Many are on group water schemes which are not part of the public water supply and have to pay dearly each year for the privilege of rather questionable quality water being distributed to their houses . #% I would also like to know whether there are wilderness areas that are currently not listed as Natura 2000 sites which would potentially come under the consideration of this report . #% We have to take seriously the claims that a proper audit into the firms was not carried out . #% It is not enough for us to simply seek to improve our capacity to arrest , detain , charge and imprison , important as that is ; we must guard against those actions that undermine the very rights that we seek to defend . #% Time is of the essence in this regard , as the more we delay the more lives are lost . #% Finally , as with every other piece of legislation on the Internet that comes before us in this House , we should use the provisions of the directive , the review clause in Article 12 and the role of the contact committee to prevent both the abuse of private copying and any abuse or limitation on fair use . #% I welcome the debates which took place this week in the European Parliament on the uses of alternative energy resources . #% This is a recipe for social and economic stagnation and environmental disaster . #% It was clear that our laws had failed to properly protect consumers . #% I particularly welcome the fact that up to EUR 600 million will be made available for the fight against these diseases , of which the EU will contribute up to EUR 200 million . #% Without their contribution to society , for which they receive no monetary remuneration , the United Kingdom would be a lesser place . #% The standard of health in the Gaza Strip is very low . #% As they grow their GDP and their per capita income - which we all hope they do - so traffic and congestion will increase pro rata . #% If such reports are not forthcoming then I could not find my vote to go with this renewal . #% We should recall the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we must find : ` unity of purpose in the post-war phase in Iraq ' . #% Parliament has a commitment to continued investment in Objective II-type areas and has requested two additional Community initiatives for urban and industrial areas . #% A similar problem . #% The Commissioner will be aware of the committee 's decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive , not least because of the complexity of the gambling market . #% I believe that , in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals , the scope of EU development aid should be restricted to the developing countries only . #% I would prefer to take this money and spend it in the regions concerned , in Spain , Portugal or France , and spend it in such a way that we have direct control over the development we promote and in a way that we could be sure would be sustainable - for fish farming or alternative industries , perhaps . #% The agreement will show our support for progress . #% I regret that delay . #% The unionists are a minority on the island of Ireland , the nationalists are a minority within Northern Ireland . #% I think there are very many good ideas in this report and I agree entirely with the rapporteur , Mr Scottà , when he talks about how important it is for European producers to add value and maximise the potential of their products . #% Let us face reality and base our decisions on scientific considerations . #% Unfortunately , since my last exchange with you , my worst fears have been realised with the closure of one of our two sugar factories in Ireland and the loss of the jobs that the factory provided . #% If the people of Sri Lanka , especially the doubters , were able to see that there is a peace dividend , this would underpin the agreement and encourage support for it . #% We need an accountable Europe that makes human rights a core value and brings progress on social and environmental rights also . #% I appreciate the response already given by the Council and Commission , but we need to have this criminal traffic in children and in the portrayal of children in a violent , abusive and obscene manner stopped . #% There are six hundred million disabled people across the world , 80 % of whom are in the developing world . #% Mr President , this year , for the second year in succession , the UN Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution calling on those states which still have the death penalty to impose a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty . #% Out of a total of 26 offences in my own country , Ireland , 20 were dealt with by the criminal courts . #% One of the key factors in assessing the work programme is to verify that the ideas and proposals put forward in it respond to the current needs of the citizens of the European Union . #% This is our duty , a duty which , last week , the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to . #% We are amending or reviewing this directive in parallel with the veterinary medicines directive and they are related . #% It also promotes a much wider awareness of sexual health matters for both women and men . #% 30 % of all scheduled flights in Europe take off late 45 % of the time . #% In addition , could he indicate how we can discourage the major sports companies which sell sports shoes and clothing at inflated prices in European stores ? #% I have learned that in Brazil the handful of sugar barons who control the sugar industry are licking their lips in anticipation at our proposed reforms , whereas those who service that industry -- the workers and the landless -- are living in fear and trepidation of their situation worsening . #% I was beginning to wonder if I was the Euro-sceptic or was he ? #% Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work and particularly the excellent definition of renewables . #% In short , the Greens consider that a rigorous programme of fleet reduction accompanied by compensation for the fishermen thus affected is a fundamental prerequisite for resolving the current crisis . #% It is important to stress that these regions , despite the progress , are still structurally and infrastructurally handicapped . #% Mr President , PVCs are plastics with a very wide range of industrial and commercial uses . #% That is the only way to guarantee permanent peace and security in the region . #% The courage and perseverance of the political leaders in the North of Ireland , together with the contribution of the Irish Taoiseach , his predecessors , the British Prime Minister and his predecessors , is only to be commended . #% The Convention , of which I was a member , painstakingly constructed a blueprint for the kind of Europe I have just outlined . #% The coastal zone is one of the most dynamic areas of the earth ' s surface with an abundance of unique flora and fauna which need to be protected . #% Like most RNA viruses , it reproduces sloppily , its genes readily fall apart , and it can absorb different genetic material which recombines in a process called reassortment . #% However , I can not support the reference to abortion . #% I suggest that the article in the comes close to the truth . #% Going organic has been a logical development for many of them . #% As I travel to Montreal next month as part of the European delegation , I look forward to seeing the global players face the reality of this year and work together as partners in tackling this extremely important global problem . #% It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward . #% There are no quick fixes and we can not overstate the importance of the alliance-building that has been done to date with the support of the International Fund for Ireland . #% How can it take 30 days , a period of time criticised at that stage as too lengthy , to get a UN force in place in Lebanon , yet with Darfur we are talking about three years ? #% Finally , overall I welcome the role of state aid in supporting the Lisbon objectives . #% An IRA unit , led by the volunteer who had fetched and then disposed of the knife , then coordinated a clean-up operation to destroy forensic and real evidence , including the CCTV footage . #% A small operator would not only be able to bid for and win a contract that would normally be beyond its capacity to complete ; but would continue to reap certain benefits even after the contract had been completed . #% At least 20 % of funding under the geographical programmes should go into these life-saving sectors of basic health and basic education . #% It is not an unimportant element of this debate . #% 
Even bananas , Boeing , beef , etc. represent no more than 2 % of the flow of transatlantic trade . #% In conclusion , it is imperative that the Doha development round gets back on track if there is to be any hope of lifting millions in the developing world out of poverty . #% A single currency should encourage lower interest and mortgage rates and in the process allow small and mediumsized businesses to operate in a more stable environment and also reduce the pressure on home owners to service their mortgages . #% Like Mrs Stihler , however , I believe there must be greater flexibility . #% I know there are lots of differences between Member States and indeed between regions and I understand the concerns in remote areas , but we must address that . #% We are often accused of being remote in this institution , of not being in touch with our people , but on this occasion the EU is working for its citizens . #% Mr President , 1 January 2002 marks another significant step in European integration . #% I agree it is necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime . #% I am despondent that the European Union has been so impotent in its efforts at seeking to stop this war and to achieve a peaceful disarmament of the Iraqis . #% The emphasis given to coordinating and developing all services involved in the elimination of drug trafficking and organized crime is also welcome . #% Obviously it was not tabled within the deadline and I have yet to receive a very clear explanation . #% In February Mr Hans von Sponek , the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq , followed in the steps of Mr Halliday when he also resigned in protest at the on-going sanctions and the bombing of the Iraqi people . #% This Parliament also has to ensure that Member State governments stop supplying arms to Indonesia until democracy is established there . #% There has been a radical shift in agricultural activity , brought about by the agricultural reforms of 2003 , and the opening-up of markets as a result of the WTO . #% That is why again , in my report , I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , `` mono '' problems . #% Mr President , I too would like to welcome the Commissioner to the House and to pay tribute to him and to Mr Castagnetti for their initiative on this proposal for the promotion of European pathways for work-linked training including apprenticeship . #% He has confirmed what we have said all along , that basically the Nice Treaty is not necessary for enlargement . #% Notwithstanding by feminist credentials , I have to say that I still believe that the family is the most satisfactory and effective social union for the care both of the young and the old . #% In his first report he pointed out how many people had petitioned , and which petitions were not admissible . #% If you look at the figures , even the more stringent budgets in the Community are only slowing the rate of increase ; they are not reducing spending . #% I believe it is up to the Maltese themselves to decide on whether or not they want to join . #% Indeed , I am happy to say that in most Member States I know this system already applies . #% Mrs Plooij warns us very starkly that our competitiveness is falling . #% Therefore reference to the role of the family should be , I believe , included in the European Community Youth Programme , which hopes to analyse the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people . #% This is not only a problem for the Irish people : it is also a problem for the British people and for the wider European Union . #% We insist on such a trade-off because , to reiterate the point , this Parliament wants new tax but not more tax . #% There can be no enlargement unless the applicant states are fit to join the single currency , posing no threat to its integrity and status , and are willing to join so as to avoid making the present two-tier Union even worse . #% In particular , the total objection to having a regionalised policy within the common fisheries policy is incorrect . #% They do not have a problem with this . #% I believe that it is not the incorporation of the police forces or security agencies of the EU which will solve this problem , but the fullest cooperation between all these agencies now and urgently . #% The proposal is limited to introducing a simplification into the operations of the European Social Fund to encourage the effective , efficient and fast uptake of available resources , without compromising the principles of sound financial management . #% Finally , the Commission must urgently re-examine the proposed compensation package for beef farmers . #% Europe should make it clear that it will deal with those elected in new elections regardless of their political affiliation , on the basis of a commitment to implementing agreements accepted by the Palestinian people . #% The European Union would make an important contribution to taking the deepest concerns of people everywhere in the Union seriously if it could produce a binding framework for the Member States . #% Amendment No 17 would impose additional obligations on Member States and would be difficult to implement . #% Continued rural development in my country is therefore vital . #% I believe these changes to vocational education will benefit the economies of all Member States . #% That will be for another day as far as I am concerned . #% It is also vital that the directive be mandatory from 2008 so as to hold out a concrete , tangible target which will help to focus minds . #% I also have a positive attitude towards this . #% The walls which have been built there completely defy any kind of international logic or law . #% It flies in the face of economic reason and is a serious blow to the development of the low-cost airline industry in Europe . #% For the past two weeks , Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna , flying these flags of convenience . #% It is also a fact that Sinn Fein 's influence within communities in Northern Ireland can bring about justice in this case . #% Bearing in mind the severe financial strain of the construction of the new offices and buildings of the European Parliament , is the Court of Auditors satisfied that : ( a ) the appropriate procedure was followed in awarding the contract for the construction of these offices in Brussels ; ( b ) sufficiently rigorous controls were put in place to minimize the cost overruns ; ( c ) the final cost of this complex represents good value for money for the European Parliament , indeed , for the European taxpayer ? #% I know it is not a negotiating state , but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states . #% The UNHCR has been very slow to react , to say the very least . #% Madam President , I wish to begin by thanking Mr Garot for his report on beef . #% By the stealth of this proposal , it is clear that Brussels aspires to replace the nation state as the deciding authority on company taxation . #% So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case . #% The European Commission intervened at that point and proposed a settlement . #% I have spoken to Mr Bradbourn , the rapporteur , and he can accept this amendment if the House accepts it . #% It is not just about economic returns . #% Like everybody else , I compliment the rapporteur , Mrs Krehl . #% I am also conscious , as somebody who still has not managed to crack this system , of the difficulty for all of us in legislating for such a volatile and dynamic medium . #% We can quite rightly bring Member States under control when they go above and beyond what is allowable as regards assisting industries or assisting employment creation opportunities . #% This Commission proposal states that noise reduction efforts are now to be assessed on the basis of individual airports , with a view to imposing operating restrictions on aircraft . #% The table in my report compares the fishing possibilities offered by the protocol under review with those available under previous agreements . #% Under the Spanish Presidency the new charter for small and medium-sized enterprises was put into effect to help European business grow and prosper more easily . #% Money must be invested in research and development into the diminishing bee population and funding must be made available to schemes which can help . #% One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today . #% In this Middle East crisis , as in so many before in this area and around the world , the innocent have suffered most for their leaders ' ambitions . #% Only from the outside did an accumulation of critics and a growing scandal about the neglect of children 's programmes eventually force her resignation . #% Mr President , it is with the utmost pleasure , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group , that I say a very sincere word of thanks to you for the very able leadership which you have given Parliament over the last two-and-a-half years . #% We must ensure they are met . #% This morning in the Irish newspapers there was yet another report of a killing as a result of feuds between drug gangs - the fifth in Ireland alone in the last year . #% 
Ethnic , religious , social and national differences play no role in sport . #% Mr President , I rise to raise an important issue for individual Members of this House relating to Council Question Time . #% in writing . - I voted in favour because , though the EU strategy for youth is , by its nature , a wide-ranging and all-encompassing document , it is crucial to reassert that any new strategy must place education at the centre of its ambition and policy . #% As I said , 2 500 Irish schoolteachers undertook development programmes in the past year . #% And the remainder would disappear if you took measures on other greenhouse gases like CFCs and methane . #% It is a useful tool , but it is a relatively modest proposal ; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model . #% The United States is forging ahead , as is Japan . #% It is also extremely hypocritical in that it criticises the Echelon interception system , while at the same time we are planning to establish a European secret service . #% I would appreciate it if the President would convey my comments to the Commission President . #% I would ask this House to condemn these nuclear tests outright and condemn India for not being part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . #% What is a significant factor , however , is the operation of the market itself . #% It poses significant environment and health problems over its entire life cycle . #% As regards the issue of scope and whether the proposed regulations should take in all aspects of animal health and welfare , or only those aspects impinging on food safety , I am glad that in the final analysis the Council accepted the wider scope that was urged by Parliament . #% Biomass offers farmers and rural areas a real possibility of generating new sources of income through the cultivation of crops such as sugar beet , cereals , oil seeds , short-rotation forestry and hemp . #% He has given undertakings that once the children are returned to his custody their mother will continue to have visiting rights as before , thus restoring the children 's right to have a relationship with both parents . #% The lesson of Bosnia-Herzegovina has not been learnt . #% We need to end impunity where it exists : outside the European Union , where we have influence ; but more importantly , within the European Union and in this case in a community in Northern Ireland . #% These young doctors , these junior doctors , are dealing with serious emergencies in a condition of extreme exhaustion . #% It is not only a question of dealing with the rights of European Union citizens working in different European Union countries , it is equally about formulating common policies to deal with people who seek to enter the European Union as asylum-seekers or refugees , or those who fall into the bracket of economic migrants . #% Their order books are full for a few more years , but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant . #% This trade agreement , I understand , could potentially cut across moves to stop this oil being imported into Europe . #% It is obvious from the testing that has been taking place , at least in my own country , that all of the younger animals and animals over 30 months that have been tested are not in any way reacting positively to the test . #% We believe that one of the measures of the consciousness of the depth of that historic challenge will be found in the reformist appetite of the states in the IGC . #% Mr President , these reports deal with very important issues , and I compliment both rapporteurs . #% We need to have an open debate on the legal basis issue in this House urgently . #% Is it intended to make it mandatory on national governments to implement such a regional policy , thus providing jobs in the regions to sustain rural communities and provide off-farm employment for farmers who do not have viable farms and other rural dwellers ? #% This is a positive debate , very positive for Europe , and widespread interest has been shown , as evidenced by the large number of amendments . #% However , I hope that he would agree with me that these atrocities in Darfur , where 180 000 people have been killed in two years and more than two million have been driven from their homes , need more urgent attention . #% We also have to address that in a serious way if we are to get to the root of this problem . #% Ulster beef , which all Europeans will soon be able to savour again when the beef ban is lifted , has a taste and quality which makes it renowned and which caused the Greenfield label to be synonymous with the highest quality . #% We all have concerns that Plan Colombia might escalate the conflict and increase the influence of the guerrillas out there . #% It is ethically wrong to harm or destroy some human lives for the potential benefit of others , and according to key international scientific leaders , research taking place in the United States is proving that using the embryo is unnecessary . #% Does the President-in-Office not agree that failure to lift the sanctions now is undermining the democratic foundations on which this Union was established ? #% They have been harassed by the police , their offices and homes have been raided , equipment has been confiscated and the pictures they have taken at protests have been used against protesters in evidence . #% However , we should not allow such a high failure rate to discourage us in our efforts to create new jobs in what has been a much neglected area up to now . #% Let us work towards that as technology develops , but to sit here and say that we can impose this from this European Parliament is totally unacceptable . #% If our experience since 1994 can show us anything , it is that first of all we must ensure that all social policy is predicated on the basis of delivering results for people - not just merely massaging figures , but actually making people 's lives better . #% I would like to thank you particularly Mr Ahern , President-in-Office of the Council , for joining with Austria and proposing a new convention on Euratom to review this treaty . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , the discarding or dumping of fish in European waters destroys over a million tonnes of fish a year , particularly in multi-species fisheries . #% Good-quality , effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross-border trade and give consumers increased choice , while protecting environmental , social and consumer rights . #% I was incensed when , as late as yesterday , the Commission could not advise us as to exactly what would be involved in ` category ' . #% The ALTENER II Programme will work and can work in every Member State and of course , outside the European Union in applicant countries , for example , as well as in the Mediterranean countries where the potential is huge . #% The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard . #% We must always recall that economic sanctions are not against the government , they are against the people and it is the people of Albania who will suffer if there are economic sanctions . #% It is heartbreaking for any family to lose a member through a road accident , but it is even more tragic and traumatic when the repatriation of a broken body is needed . #% Arrangements for the Isle of Man and similar territories within the United Kingdom are well catered for and are not presenting any difficulties , and have been well catered for since accession in 1973 . #% Major European companies have to be accountable in how they operate in other parts of the world . #% Mr President , I welcome the broad thrust of the proposals published by the Commission in its annual legislative programme for the year 2000 . #% It must certainly be a source of great encouragement to you . #% And I would like to emphasise that research and development should be a public service obligation , because in a free market research is one of the areas that is most at risk . #% A few days ago our shipyard was to close because it failed to win the contract to build two ships . #% However , whilst he may be technically correct in saying that the Council does not have an area or role of responsibility with regard to the question of nuclear facilities , there is an immediate need for political leadership . #% As the debate on climate change developed following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the harmful impact of these fluorinated gases , owing to their high global warming potential or GWP , became recognised as a major contributor -- 5 % and rising -- to the ` greenhouse effect ' . #% And yet Israel continues with impunity to maintain an air and sea blockade of its victim while continuing to squeeze the economic and political life out of Gaza , not to mention the killing of 200 Palestinians under the cover of the war on Lebanon . #% The computer games industry in my own region represents a third of the computer games world market . #% Only this week we hear of reports of outbreaks among the elk in the Colorado regions of the US and of new variant CJD outbreak among young men , young hunters - not the normal age group associated with CJD as we have over the years understood it to be . #% When the Treaty of Amsterdam is ratified by all the Member States and comes into being , how do you view the unanimity clause as regards the non-discrimination and social exclusion provisions . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today . #% This is something that must be taken into account in future WTO negotiations to ensure that EU producers are not put at a disadvantage . #% Partnership is the key at all times and consultation between all interested parties is very important if the problem of social exclusion is to be solved sooner rather than later . #% For example , companies could find it more profitable to officially relocate their headquarters to countries outside the EU and then to post their workers to their European branches to avoid having to provide the same rights and conditions for their workers that are legally applicable to EU citizens working in the EU . #% That is the most despicable form of political discourse or activity that I have ever come across . #% I advocate that we vote against the PPE and that we adopt the Socialist report now that the Socialists have withdrawn the amendment , for reasons perhaps better known to some of those in the southern part of Europe . #% In Africa more than 50 species are for sale in markets and restaurants , including antelopes , monkeys , apes , pangolins , pigs , large rodents , elephants , reptiles -- such as snakes , lizards and crocodiles , invertebrates -- such as snails and insects , and birds such as hornbills . #% I certainly feel that the European Investment Bank should be encouraged to help young farmers into the industry through the bond scheme . #% I would also join with Ms McKenna in saying that vitamins - which I personally , as a nurse , do not regard as a food supplement - are on free sale in our country and that I have never yet heard of anybody overdosing on vitamin C or any other vitamin . #% 
I do not wish to undermine the work of EWL it has a legitimate purpose and has a right to receive funding but I simply propose that the funding should also be available to other women 's organisations , who feel that EWL does not speak for them . #% We need to look at this situation urgently . #% In particular , I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party I wish to address the report by Mr Ruffolo . #% And while the disease has appeared in only four Member States , we can not yet be sure that it will not spread further . #% I would add one word of caution . #% The report talks about the need not to fuel religious fundamentalism or provoke any unnecessary anti-Western reactions . #% Accordingly , given our history of success in conflict resolution in Europe , would it not be a very good thing if , during the Irish presidency , you were to persuade the Commission to set up a special department of peace and reconciliation so that , instead of sending armies to areas of conflict , a team of people equipped with the European Union 's philosophy and principles is dispatched to those areas , since today we are in a stronger position to shape the world ? #% How much of this came from the European Council inviting the Commission to take initiatives ? #% But when those elements are set , it is the role of the Central Bank to call the monetary policy mix , and we need not at this stage reopen old debates . #% What is the chance of the import tariffs remaining at around 36 % reduction and not closer to the 60 % proposed ? #% The members of the Académie française could immortalise this word by putting it in the dictionary . #% There could well be a strong role for the SOLVIT network in assisting with the implementation of the Services Directive . #% I welcome the opportunity to have this debate . #% I have some animal welfare concerns also , in particular developing validation of alternative methods for animal testing and hastening the replacement of animal-based toxicity testing with regard to chemicals policy . #% I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection . #% To farmers the price received in the marketplace should represent the real value of their professional endeavours , rather than what they often perceive as social support for the products of their labour . #% We must build a European Union that commands the good will and support and enthusiasm of the 370 million citizens who make up the membership of the Union . #% Madam President , in the run-up to this debate we have seen left-wing and Liberal hysteria reach a crescendo . #% Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets . #% Far from giving more rights to the European Union institutions , the Charter limits the exercise of power by the EU institutions because they must explicitly respect human rights . #% Looking at what we have before us , I have to say to you , Commissioner , that the present situation can not continue . #% The EU got nothing that matters in return for its commitment to eliminate export subsidies by 2013 . #% Aquaculture is not dangerous . #% This market has worked extremely well and when serious animal health problems arise , such as foot-and-mouth disease , swine fever or Newcastle disease , the geographical area involved is isolated and suspended from the common trade arrangements until that disease is controlled and eradicated . #% There will also be improved coordination of policy programmes in the area of the Information Society , modern telecommunications services and Internet-related activities . #% When debating this instrument , our overriding concern must be the interests of the developing countries , and in particular the poorest sections of their populations . #% The next step will be to extend the joint register to all the EU institutions and to convince the Commission and Council to make it mandatory . #% We have to welcome some of the positive things that have happened in recent times . #% Following the impact of liberalisation , it has lost significant parts of the profitable portion of its market while it continues to bear the burden of carrying a universal service obligation to the furthest corners of the Republic of Ireland . #% Air traffic management in Europe is fragmented and the current system is not able to keep pace with the demand , which results in delays in many flights . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Jackson for her work . #% The Council should adopt a framework decision which provides protection against the activities of intelligence services of other Member States or third countries . #% This proposal also covers the important legislative initiatives in areas such as safety of blood and blood derivatives , and the implementation of wider anti-smoking campaigns . #% We have a long way to go in the European Union , but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban . #% Mr President , the Minutes do not record my presence yesterday . #% With regard to Iran , EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights . #% I believe this hypocrisy must stop , and must stop now . #% Moreover , for the large majority of scientists and also for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which encompass the ecosystem as a whole , rather than relying on an outdated concept of animal population dynamics . #% Revelations followed daily and the local authority had a heated and intense discussion on this question yesterday . #% We need imaginative steps like this if we are to stand any chance of reducing the threat of global warming . #% Mr President , I think we should vote . #% I want the Commissioner to ensure that whatever is brought in is unified throughout the European Union and is financed in a unified way so that no one Member State can pour in more money than another to support their particular industry . #% We all agree , for example , that energy is the largest contributor by far to the emission of greenhouse gases . #% In fact I would prefer no prescribed minimums at all . #% I should like to raise questions on the social criteria . #% The European Union clearly has to prioritise its budgetary commitments . #% It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs . #% We have made progress in Amsterdam , in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the new draft Constitution on re-establishing the rights of citizens to public services . #% The rapporteur is correct , however , in pointing out that the European Parliament must be consulted again if an extension of the card to include personal medical data is proposed -- indeed , this has already been suggested -- as the proper protection of personal information -- particularly of a medical nature -- is a major concern . #% The Commission proposal to now replace this sales ban with a mere test ban is totally unacceptable and of great concern in view of massive public demand to end the use of animal testing for cosmetics . #% In the current climate of depressed prices and policy uncertainty , we are going to place our farmers at a further disadvantage . #% Furthermore he stated he did not intend to stand down at a specific moment in time . #% They are worried about the content of the programmes their children are watching , particularly the level of violence and unsuitable programmes . #% I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency . #% We have fought for years within the European Union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market . #% At the time they joined the European Union there was only a six-mile limit in existence . #% The aim of the legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases . #% Since Sir Leon has galloped through the answer at enormous speed , I will have to ask him if he would give me a copy of his answer . #% In the immediate term , the need to assemble aid and coordinate its distribution is fundamental , particularly in inaccessible parts of the disaster zones . #% In the interests of transparency , this document should be available in all languages so people can see what is going on at these K4 meetings . #% The parliaments of ACP countries should press for their involvement in the adoption and execution of the country and regional strategy papers , as these are the main programming tools for development assistance . #% Since then , every summer , 14 000 children have been brought from Chernobyl to Ireland for a three-week break in a clean environment , to get fresh air , to live with host families , to know what it is like to live in a proper family environment , and to get medical and dental treatment . #% Despite some of the very serious issues that have been raised here this evening , we did not hold the workers hostage and we approved the EUR 14.8 million application . #% This is the problem - the women who are here at the moment in this Parliament - the women who have actually achieved - who have got somewhere - are much better than the vast majority of men . #% In particular , the areas that we are talking about in this present raft of recognition of qualifications , are areas where we have experienced huge shortages within the EU in the recent past . #% 
On the issue of controls , this is something that relates not only to this issue but also to a vast area of legislation in the European Union , where legislation is in place but it is not enforced ; there are no controls . #% I should like to ask this House to lend its support to my colleague John Hume in trying to find out the truth so that justice will prevail . #% I appeal for the stakeholders in the industry to be consulted in a meaningful way , not with platitudes . #% Well done to you Taoiseach , and to your team . #% The very next question in my name addresses the issue of xenophobia and I do not know why it was not taken together with Question No 7 . #% The reason why we looked for the 1 % of the ESF to be ringfenced for these kind of actions is that we were afraid that if it were left for the Council to decide , no money would be made available to the NGOs and for these other actions . #% At the informal Glasgow Council , children from across the European Union fifteen Member States were asked to design and present to ministers their ideal city of the future . #% However , what is most important is that the needs of the children are placed above all else . #% The provision of proper conditions for live animals moving from one Member State to another must be guaranteed . #% I hope I will be able to report back to these architects that the result of what we are doing here today in conjunction with the Council will contribute to the ongoing completion of the single market . #% The report today must be supported as it is a real and positive step in the right direction . #% I would appeal to the Commission , to the incoming Irish presidency and to you , Mr President , particularly as the EU-US Summit will be held during the Irish presidency , to impress upon President Bush the serious misjudgment he is making in this matter and the potential negative consequences for us all in western Europe . #% Ireland is seldom the first port of call for prospective asylum seekers . #% I welcome the IOC 's announcement that heavy penalties will be imposed on sportsmen and women caught using drugs in Sydney this month and in the future . #% Scientists have been predicting a lethal cyclical resurgence of influenza for some time , one that will be more deadly because of our low levels of resistance . #% I have not spoken about any monetarist approach . #% Secondly , I have made it very clear that the White Paper on Foreign Policy , published by the Irish Government earlier this year , said that if a suitable opportunity arose in the course of the IGC the Irish Government would seek an improvement in the status of Irish in the Union and that Members could therefore take it that we would also take a similar attitude to other languages . #% For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided . #% People in close proximity can come , other people can not . #% The Dutch Government intends to carry out 17 more shipments in the coming years . #% We have transferred to this Union 1 % of our national taxation , which is used in the interest of Community policies . #% No other amendment is possible . #% It should be given the specific tasks of ensuring that the public is adequately protected on the one hand and , on the other , that new developments in food production be carefully explained at an early stage . #% The Perry report is another piece of important work and , as the Ombudsman has said , it is appropriate that Mr Perry , the author of the report , is given a role in initiating the whole idea of a code of conduct at European level . #% If a renewed transatlantic partnership is desirable it is certainly not going to be easy to achieve because of the ongoing differences between many EU governments and the present US administration . #% A report just issued by Ireland 's Economic and Social Research Institute makes a significant attempt to quantify the cost of reducing gas emissions linked to global warming . #% The Commission should contact in particular the ministers of health and education in the Northern Ireland Assembly , Ms de Brun and Mr Martin McGuinness . #% Consumers will not forgo these products . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to discuss this report on the importance of libraries for the European Union . #% It does not make sense that we should now be negotiating with the European Commission , following all the events of the past several months , a new code of conduct which , inter alia , insists that where there are issues of importance the Commission first comes here to tell this House what they are and then to take a procedure , such as the annual Report of the Court of Auditors , and say : there was a leak , it is a bit unfortunate , but let us get on with business as if nothing happened . #% We are committed to a capability for autonomous EU action in my group . #% I have concentrated in my committee mainly on the issues of the internal market , intellectual property aspects and the general policy framework . #% People are dying in huge numbers and at some point the international community is obliged to act more firmly . #% I want to stress to the Commission and to the Member States that the committee 's negotiating team wanted the EU to adopt the highest international standards and best practices in ensuring we ban this obscene trade and that cat and dog fur products do not end up in the shops by the back door . #% Some in this House - I believe from the outset that they have been a minority , though perhaps rather vocal in terms of the media - have talked of targeting individual nominees . #% At the top of the list were the United States , Canada and then the UK . #% It is not surprising that Belize is there , considering last year ' s revelations about Michael Ashcroft , the Tory Party treasurer ' s business connections there . #% Organisations which use violence , should be told very clearly that their claim to be acting to achieve human and civil rights for people is completely false , because their method undermines the most fundamental human right of all , the right to life . #% If this incident , with the consequences it had for the shared environment and European fishing industries , had occurred in EU waters , and if an EU coastguard had existed , the response time would have been reduced , a refuge port would have been designated and the damage could have been minimised . #% In order to achieve this properly in this very difficult situation , careful monitoring of the funds and how they are disbursed is most important . #% Although the directive is an improvement on the Commission 's proposal which we rejected in 1996 , it still does not go far enough to protect the environment and public health . #% There are many less damaging forms of marker genes available and it is EU policy to prohibit all unnecessary use of antibiotics if there is a risk for human or animal health . #% Mr President , I want to concentrate on the need to tackle the growing phenomenon of child abuse on the Internet . #% Obviously , this is of great concern . #% I would like to know how many more Commissioners are bending over backwards to facilitate specific business interests against the interests of the Community as a whole . #% Lastly , I should like to say to the Commissioner that in Ireland it is hard to take her recommendations on organic farming seriously , when she will not allow us to declare the island a GMO-free zone . #% Prime Minister Sharon has offered an uncompromising war on terror , but he has not offered any diplomatic solution to avoid the escalating spiral of violence and brutality . #% I thank him and colleagues who were on the temporary committee for the first year . #% He would have been proud of the work done by our rapporteur , Mrs Gebhardt , and all the Members who have worked so hard to improve and amend the Commission proposal . #% We take your words at face value , but we will not accept them forever . #% Madam President , I should like to congratulate Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck on their excellent work on the 2003 budget . #% We must guard against the tendency to introduce new legislation , particularly at European level , which increases the overall costs of production in our industry and threatens the job security of everybody ultimately employed in the industry . #% It is clear that Turkey has a key role to play in shaping the European Union of the future and we must do all in our power to guarantee that the new Turkish Government is given full support and encouragement in its desire to make their country meet the Copenhagen criteria so as to begin accession negotiations . #% The Sudan situation will be debated and a draft resolution considered . #% This failure to set a minimum distance and thus protect local communities from the dangers of landfill goes against the precautionary approach and the protection of public health . #% We must be more flexibility-friendly , not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union , sending it to low-cost labour areas . #% However , that opinion is not as cast-iron or as tight as we would like to think it is . #% We plead with Member States to implement what they have said in their declarations . #% Just one comment if I may : I understand that on various occasions colleagues may want to test the quorum . #% How can you encourage young people onto the land ? #% It sets out a framework for the prohibition of discrimination on these grounds and establishes a uniform minimum level of protection within the European Union for people who have suffered such discrimination . #% I hope it does not , but we must be ready if it does . #% She criticized my conduct when she said I sniggered at a comment made on the opinion given on the Wijsenbeek report . #% Now doctors - and , of course , nurses as well , I must make a point for them too - are expected to be highly technologically proficient . #% I agree , which precisely raises the question : `` Why bother ? '' #% The constitution produced by the Convention must remain largely intact . #% 
That some Irish members should vote against such a proposal is incomprehensible given that the European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions in Dublin would be in line to carry out such work . #% It ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles . #% Mr President , Ireland 's version of the social dialogue , which we call social partnership , is well established and has played a major part in the economic success which our country has achieved over recent years . #% Much has been made of women 's rights in Afghanistan , but as I said , nothing has changed . #% You must therefore ensure that the Seville conclusions at least include a declaration that Nice does not in any way modify the Irish policy of military neutrality , currently defined as non-membership of mutual defence pacts . #% To conclude , I want to support the call by my colleagues for a European taskforce , not only to monitor the existing situation , but whose remit would also be to monitor and approve a European-wide eradication programme . #% I have to say I disagree with Commissioner Patten in relation to the trade agreements . #% We now have before us the best prospects for a generation of building lasting peace and prosperity across the whole of south-east Europe and the European Union is prepared to play an active role in this regard . #% We also need to remember that a regulatory framework for marketing and using plant protection products already exists under EU law . #% It is very hard to know what is happening when licences are granted to 70 or 80 vessels to catch such a small amount of fish . #% This summer ASEAN is expected to admit Burma as a member . #% However , with Spanish Members so deeply divided on the resolution before us , it has made it impossible for the rest of Parliament to form a united view on a subject that we really should not be divided on . #% The Israeli Government has failed to meet its obligations to dismantle settlement outposts and freeze settlement activity . #% EMU therefore needs to demonstrate that it can support , underpin and promote cohesion . #% However , I want to reiterate what Mr Poettering and others have said : we must not in any way believe that all Arabs are terrorists . #% Mr President , environmental protection is now a priority for most Member States , and European citizens are increasingly aware of its social and economic potential . #% Therefore , raising awareness , changing attitudes and , above all , exchanging best practice is an enormous contribution we can make here to this most important area . #% Every single job lost in the European aviation industry as a result of the Commission 's decision , will create an ever-widening pool of resentment towards Europe , not towards national governments which may be pursuing their own agendas . #% As one of the 200 parliamentarians from every corner of Europe who prepared this text in open forum , may I say that what we have is a qualitatively different treaty proposal from any treaty that has ever been put before the people of Europe . #% The only way that can be done is by taking them out of the area of conflict and bringing them into dialogue , giving them the support and the strength and the backbone that they need , not only to convince themselves that peace is achievable and that harmony can be achieved between the peoples of Israel and Palestine , but also that they will be given full support from the European Union and each of its Member States to achieve that . #% Others have taken up our cudgels . #% Firstly , more than EUR 2 billion came from revenue . #% Affordable imports of protein from third countries such as the US are crucial if we wish to ensure food security and create conditions in which farmers can earn a decent living from agriculture . #% Whilst it is essential that we try to encourage peace and democracy in the Mediterranean , it is absolutely clear that the strategy behind the European Neighbourhood Policy has so far failed . #% What flexibility is going to be granted to Member States ? #% Air travel in particular has become cheaper and more convenient for everyone . #% The Committee of Experts was established , as you will see if you read the terms of reference and the original vote in this House , under the auspices of Parliament not one of its committees . #% If , by our discussions here tonight and our work over the next year each of us could get one single person into a quality job we could achieve a lifetime 's work because we have helped our fellow human beings to help themselves and they in turn can be the trainers , educators and ambassadors of the future . #% Mr President , I would like to wish the President-in-Office and his government colleagues every success during the Irish presidency . #% Almost no foodstuffs are inherently bad . #% I can not speak for Greece or Portugal -- their own Members will do that -- but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries , although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough . #% I therefore ask the Commission to clarify its position on supplementary measures . #% Between 1994 and 1999 the state-training agency in Ireland received # 428 million for vocational training and education . #% Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on your threat to cut off European funding . #% Normally I do not engage in national politics , but today it is for a European reason that I want to state clearly for the record of the House that to vote `` yes '' to Nice in Ireland is to vote to remove the last formal obstacle to a significant enlargement . #% I share the broad concerns that the present system of rotating presidencies may not be an effective model to operate in a Community of 25 Member States , but I strongly believe that more discussion is certainly going to have to take place on how the European Council is going to carry out its business in an enlarged Union . #% We must do this to protect the industry . #% A serious abuse of European law and the Statute of the European Investment Bank is taking place in my own country . #% Additionally , if we are to learn any lessons from the current debacle and disarray in which the European Union finds itself , then the European Convention and the subsequent IGC have to consider the arguments advanced at the heart of this report . #% The proposals , if adopted , would increase the level of plaice stocks to above the precautionary levels of three to five years . #% It would simply be too much to ask small companies in Europe to deal with two different currencies for what was originally planned as a six-month period for the changeover . #% The whole debate on pharmaco-vigilance versus the compulsory five-year review , and the question of whether to centralise the registration procedure or keep the centralised , national and mutual recognition procedures is critical . #% It is outrageous in today 's world , with so much poverty and hunger , both around the world and right here in the EU , that such a policy should exist . #% Tax harmonisation is not an acceptable idea for example to my delegation so you can not promulgate ideas which are not politically acceptable . #% I agree with the rapporteur on this point . #% Mr President , I also want to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent report he has produced . #% They left , it seems , as a result of ongoing problems of cross border fuel smuggling and laundering . #% The Socialist Group has put forward an amendment asking for a framework directive ensuring that in sectors like energy services of general interest are protected . #% The reason of course is to try and cover up the regime of enormous corruption which exists in that country . #% We talk about food security in Europe ; if you want food security , we are giving it to you - we are giving you food safety . #% The WTO argument is just an excuse not to deliver on what was originally promised . #% Arising from the reply from the President-in-Office , would he consider requesting a proposal from the Commission on this important matter ? #% Three , the de-skilling of women as primary health care providers as medicine became institutionalized in the 19th and early 20th centuries . #% It is to be hoped that as we move towards the creation of defence structures , we will not forget the importance of conflict prevention , and also of continued investment in our policy on democratisation and human rights , because it is abuses in those areas that give rise to conflict in many parts of the world . #% Mr President , African countries have made solemn commitments to democracy and the protection of human rights on numerous occasions : under the NEPAD agreement and the ACP-EU Cotonou Agreement , to name but two . #% I therefore support the Commission 's proposal to submit to the Göteborg Council a plan for energy saving and diversification of energy sources aimed at more efficient energy use . #% Mr President , Amendment No 206 is not rendered redundant by the adoption of the previous amendment . #% This is one of the problems with this compromise resolution , that it is too weak on this point . #% When we talk about the WTO , Ireland is their first casualty in terms of sugar beet production . #% The waves also hit the coasts of Belgium , Britain , France , Ireland and the Netherlands . #% The cost will not be proportional to the environmental benefit . #% Are we seriously willing to sacrifice not only our climate and planet , but also our economies ? #% Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements . #% I would ask you , Madam President , to invite a Commissioner as urgently as possible here to tell us precisely what the European Union intends to do on the issue of Chechnya . #% Many of these countries continue to imprison persons who are referred to as ` cyber dissidents ' and we call for their immediate release . #% Madam President , we know what this is about : basically it is a technical debate . #% 
The modulation funds must go back to the farmer and must not be thrown away on useless projects that have no hope of surviving . #% The reform process must , therefore , combine fairness with affordability and durability , with more simplification and efficiency . #% Every year I hear of one , two or even sometimes three cases where people experience problems in relation to the repatriation of remains . #% Indeed , most of the research effort in the field of neurodegenerative diseases is carried out by Member States , with a relatively low level of transnational coordination , leading to fragmentation and limited sharing of knowledge and best practices among Member States . #% We accept the logical reason that you have given , but I have to ask you a further question . #% The proposed directive on improving the quality of shipping fuels is important as it will bring the quality of shipping fuels into line with on-land motor fuels . #% I do not see the relevance of this idea of ex-territoriality . #% It is a very relevant debate . #% As this was clearly inaccurate , according to the regulator 's report , this independent verification now lacks credibility . #% However , the Government of Sudan remains opposed to such a force , accusing the UN of an exercise in neo-colonialism manipulated by Washington . #% Now we are suggesting that LSD and Ecstasy are consumer products that should be distributed like sweets . #% Madam President , I am sorry that the spirit of Christmas is not prevailing . #% Secondly , some Members have referred to this as the ` constitution ' of Europe . #% Mr Garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about . #% Ironically enough , it is in the United States , where the energy star scheme originated , that we have recently seen the absurd spectacle of power cuts in California , largely because of the incredible increase in the use of computers and other office equipment with the accompanying need for air-conditioning within a framework of quite bizarre and unwise deregulation . #% Advertising for other legally sold products including pharmaceuticals and alcohol is similarly restricted . #% It is crucial that , in the process , human rights are respected . #% The EU must aim to be an example of the well off always willing to give a hand-up to those less advantaged then ourselves . #% Mr President , in the time available I want to refer to just one particular line in the budget which is the school milk scheme where the Commission has proposals to reduce the allocation from EUR 96 million to EUR 53 million . #% Can we move on to the explanation of votes please ? #% Only a breakthrough into the export market can save us . #% In particular , I want to signal on behalf of my group an interest in the non-debate that waxes and wanes every so often about the reform of the UN Security Council . #% I believe that Parliament must firmly reject human cloning . #% It is very disturbing to hear you , as President of this Parliament , criticise us in the media and question our credibility . #% The huge problem of confidence in our institutions has been exacerbated by the problems of the Commission in recent months . #% However , there is much that we can learn from each other . #% I would sincerely hope the Council and the Commission have taken note of our views . #% Agriculture is the single rural affairs policy for which the Community has total responsibility . #% in writing . - I strongly support this report on progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals . #% It is disrespectful of the rights of the citizens of Europe and for the dignity of the people of Europe . #% A compromise has been reached between the institutions at a recent Conciliation Committee meeting which was held last March . #% This is a clear case of the British government using the war on terrorism to distract attention from awkward and contentious decisions . #% There were some controversial proposals in the Rothley report , particularly as regards EU tax . #% Finally , when we receive the Commission 's updated report , I hope we will be able to quickly resolve any outstanding problems , so that the Maltese people can themselves decide once and for all on their future place in the European Union . #% This gives some certainty to the scientific community of the European Union , it allows some important programmes to proceed , it gives us a clean sheet for the Fifth Framework Programme and it allows money to be spent with a legal base . #% Please , can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen . #% It is an extremely difficult balance . #% The Conciliation Committee has also agreed to enable Member States to retain and implement more favourable arrangements in respect of the victim than the provisions required so as to ensure compliance with this directive . #% The short tourist season is a real concern , with the need to spread the demand outside the high season and promote tourism products for different tastes , different interests , different seasons and different age groups . #% That will help to prevent the recurrence of such acts as the murder of Robert McCartney . #% I am hopeful that the ten applicant countries will be in a position to fully join the European Union on May 1st 2004 next . #% Among the elements of this resolution that particularly appeal are the recognition of the crucial role of small and medium-sized enterprises and the support that needs to be given to them . #% So I can really empathise with those who feel passionately about the need to be able to bring animals freely throughout Europe subject to the conditions being laid down today and I welcome the report here before us . #% It has also called for a legally enforceable regime whereby diplomatic assurances from third countries can be challenged in law . #% I want to congratulate the Commission in coming forward with proposals which , in a spirit of solidarity , provide funding for those areas of the EU-15 -- including the UK -- that are still in need . #% Hopefully , it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals . #% What disappoints me about all this is the shock expressed by the Irish finance minister . #% My final political comment , in general terms , with regard to the upcoming Vienna Summit , is that this will afford an opportunity to review the claims of other applicant states . #% I hope that you , Mrs Ashton , and Commissioner De Gucht , work strongly towards this aim in the respective visits to the United States , Haiti and elsewhere later this week . #% We need a real ceasefire . #% I would like to follow up on Mr Titley 's question . #% In presenting this regulation to the public we should also highlight that this is probably the single most important piece of social legislation to come out of this Parliament and one that makes a real difference to people 's lives in that it reflects the realities in which the modern-day European Union citizen is working . #% On the great white shark issue , the Community has generally supported the Appendix II listing , but rejected the zero quota on legal and scientific grounds . #% All of these and more are needed , but not the illusion that quick , short-term budget fixes are an answer . #% I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory , but can we not , with our financial and organisational capacity , reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own ? #% On ethics in biotechnology , the proposals allow funding of research into the alteration of the germline of human beings . #% The list of neglected diseases continues . #% 873 000 people commit suicide , and that is probably underestimated . #% -- Mr President , over the past 300 years , 10 influenza pandemics have occurred among humans . #% Although Latin American countries would be the most indebted in global amounts , it is the sub-Saharam African countries that are in most difficulty . #% I ask myself : is this really a Council position or is it the position of one or two Member States ? 80 % of Member States have design protection already in national law . #% Yet , at the same time , the same EU deems it appropriate that the budget of this place increases by 6 % . #% The fact of the matter is that we need to reduce the level of greenhouse gases that are being produced in Europe and in the United States . #% Throughout Europe , inputting electricity at specific prices is an instrument for gradually dealing with the centralised structure through secure access to the market for decentralised electricity production from renewable sources . #% No good ever comes from pandering to terrorists or their political apologists and I hope that Israel , the EU and Mr Solana will not waver in following such a line and that they will not waver in insisting that the only way forward is for Hamas to give up violence and recognise Israel . #% The European agricultural model , based on family farms , in my view provides the infrastructure necessary to give our consumers quality and choice . #% 
If you want to know why Europe is unpopular in many areas of the European Union , just look at this type of proposal . #% Many thousands of women have been abused in the most horrific ways during conflict situations , as a tool of war . #% I am saddened that I stand here tonight and we do not have a resolution . #% The real losers in this situation would be the small European farmers who are already on the breadline . #% Our role in supporting Northern Ireland has been a major success . #% They have also reaffirmed their commitment to recognise and live in peace with Israel . #% I believe that is what we are all trying to do . #% We would be foolish too to assume that the Iraqi war is a one-off war plan . #% So let us make it simple . #% Does he agree that the contribution of farmers to a society can not always be evaluated in purely economic terms and that their role as environmental managers and guarantors of food security and quality puts them outside the economic realm of other professions ? #% As a Member of the European Parliament for the West and North-West of Ireland , I represent a predominantly rural constituency . #% Mr President , I will start where my colleague finished . #% It is important that we back the Commissioner 's proposal for a centre for communicable diseases , but we should be insisting that every Member State put money up front for this centre . #% We had another committee which gave a different point of view . #% Therefore , I hope that the Council will take further action to ensure that this does not continue and also to seek out where other convictions of a similar nature have taken place . #% Even if we succeed in keeping global warming at safe levels , climate change entails unavoidable consequences which require adaptation efforts . #% We must be guided by the humanitarian imperative . #% We know that inequalities persist and it is the objective of cohesion to continue to try to overcome these . #% In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions . #% The scope of public services concerned covers healthcare , education , security , climate change and energy efficiency , all issues which benefit the entirety of society . #% But I have to say that the continuing campaign in Great Britain against the import of Irish beef is and must be a matter of concern for all committed Members of the European Union . #% That system eventually incurred costs for the European budget . #% There are essentially two tasks for national and European authorities : they have to oversee the successful changeover to the euro and provide the public with information about it . #% I welcome the common agreement from the Commission and Council on this matter and congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to garner the House . #% We can not afford any weakening of quality standards . #% Looking at the positive side , yesterday we saw where Parliament can respond . #% in writing . - I voted against this motion . #% The European Disability Forum and Parliament 's Disability Rights Intergroup have campaigned long and hard on this issue . #% It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy , the common agricultural policy , the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy . #% This report was careful to emphasise the solidarity between the generations and is clever to ensure that nobody thinks that there is one single solution to the ageing society and the problems that are entailed with it . #% Madam President , coming from Donegal , a border county in the historic province of Ulster , I , like my Irish colleague Mrs Doyle , have a very special appreciation for the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland in the recent past , and in particular the developments of the last few days . #% While Parliament must look at its own role very seriously , especially following the poor turnout in the recent elections in many Member States - evidence at best of disinterest but more likely cynicism and disdain by our citizens - our job today is to respond to the hearing of the Commissioners-elect and to the case put by the President-elect , Mr Prodi . #% It is one which has driven people in the past into physics , and it is very serious if we have a diminution in the number of people studying that subject . #% Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 . #% I also believe that players have a huge role to play in this . #% Madam President , obviously in this House we are parliamentarians and democrats . #% Israeli customs can be given a very long time , up to ten months , to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive . #% Let me go straight to one particular point of concern for the agriculture budget , namely , the clearance of accounts line . #% There is a necessity for their data-protection systems to be put in place and to be clear for all to see in operation and to understand . #% I would urge the Commission to include in the recommendation targets for Member States to meet and also annual reports on the meeting of those targets . #% I believe that bringing to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States should not mean suffering and terror for other innocent people . #% That is the nub of the debate on the deeply flawed Services Directive . #% If such exaggerated proposals were to be approved they would have a serious socio-economic impact with no health benefit . #% I wish however today to make some remarks on the policy side arising from what Mr Prodi has said . #% I am concerned that the WTO may be pushing for trade without due concern to animal health and human health implications . #% The rapporteur stresses the equal value - and I agree with him - of cohesion policy alongside achieving the single European market and economic and monetary union . #% I trust this report will receive widespread and deserved approval . #% I know that the Dublin Foundation greatly appreciates the efforts Mr KellettBowman has made and for the measured response in his report . #% I did have some problems with the text as adopted by the Fisheries Committee . #% The fishing industry is being held accountable for the damage it wreaks on the marine community . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply . #% Mr President , the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come . #% Madam President , with regard to Alzheimer 's disease I am especially pleased that Parliament has been able , even in a small way , to play a role with regard to this major health scourge . #% I should like some clarification on whether the report , which you indicate as being finalised , is the report dated 15 November 2005 that has already been circulated in draft form to the social partners . #% In reality , it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market , while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services . #% Regarding the Cartagena Protocol , it must be aid that our own European Commission tried to resist clauses to introduce Cartagena into the Directive 90/220 . #% I come from Northern Ireland , and Mrs Doyle has referred to the fact that she comes from the Republic of Ireland . #% I should like to thank Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Fabra Vallés personally for their efforts to resolve the problem relating to the Veterinary Institute in Grange and to express my satisfaction with the outcome . #% Let me commend your efforts to try to meet the timetable . #% It can lead to a range of choice and we all support that , but we also know from surveys by national consumer councils , particularly in my Member State , that consumers do not yet have sufficient trust and confidence in the new technology to shop on-line . #% If the overall social , human and environmental benefits of clean air are to be secured , then the standards laid down by the EU ' s recent directive on vehicle emissions and fuel quality must be strictly adhered to . #% For example , a synthetic fibre that might be subject to that duty is given added value by making it into a roller blind , whereby it escapes the anti-dumping duty and is dumped in the EU at ridiculous prices . #% It is clear that the governments of the Member States of the European Union are more interested in trade than they are in eliminating poverty . #% There is a major contradiction in what the Commission is doing and I wish the Commission would revert to its previous approach of being extremely progressive on the conservation of fisheries . #% We are all human and we belong to human institutions . #% In Ireland there is no legal requirement for seatbelts on school buses . #% 
Unless we put in place a proper financial model and basis for securing universal pensions for all , the system is bound to fail because of demographics and other priorities that may arise . #% I am told by medical researchers that the amount to be spent on BSE is unrealistically high . #% Now the question arises , how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan ? #% Yes , it will take time and no doubt it will be difficult . #% Please be careful . #% I would ask you , Mr President , to respond to the e-mail I sent to your office at the end of July concerning this issue . #% I believe that we must ensure that all facilities are checked to allow for the maximum protection of facilities and , more importantly , for the safety and security of the populations in their locations . #% Last month 's ruling of the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of the EU 's main waste management directive represented a damning indictment of the Government 's environmental record . #% I fully support this EP report 's call to compensate farmers for their efforts in reducing emissions and to provide support in adapting to climate mitigation measures . #% I want to mention the following : French training of security forces and death squads in Rwanda ; the sale of arms by Belgians to Rwanda ; the training of Indonesian troops by the British ; German submachine-guns used in a prison massacre in Brazil ; Hawk jets sent to the Indonesians so they can persecute the people of East Timor ; UK arms sales to places such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia ; torture weapons being sold to countries so that they can inflict human rights abuses on people around the world . #% The killings are similar in method and consequence to previous clashes in 2001 , 2004 and 2008 . #% I will defend the Irish constitution against usurpation . #% However , this has been a long-standing and persistent problem for the developing world . #% Literacy rates need to be improved , especially in the context of the elections where literacy was a huge problem . #% There is no doubt that this matter of the Irish Box is all-important . #% We can not go back to burying people , we have to move forward in peace together and to do that we have to maintain political authority . #% Yes , I support the proposal submitted and I will support the proposal that emerges , but I wish to stress that the principle can not continue for ever and support in the future can not be taken for granted as it has been in the past . #% It will complement efforts by Member States and will encourage the laggardly Member States to do more . #% This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community 's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel . #% The Jean Monnet programme has been successful in achieving some of these objectives within the European Union itself . #% Gestures will not halt his aggression any more than our words or resolutions . #% Unfortunately , companies have already been developing and patenting cloning techniques . #% In Ireland , as everybody knows , beef and milk represent 71 % of our entire agricultural output . #% Not in the first instance in court where the average cost for a cross-border case is EUR 2 500 and it takes between 23 and 29 months to resolve . #% I would like to say that , in general , a more client-focused approach by all of the institutions would make you redundant , though I do not think that will happen in the near future . #% Perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on . #% I am happy to agree with the opinion put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , which suggests that the Commission should analyse whether the Nitrates Directive can be repealed from 2008 . #% I would like to commend the Commission on its SCM 2000 programme and of course , in the context of the Teverson Report I would like to thank Mr Teverson for taking on board my own Group 's amendments in committee to this report . #% While the Taoiseach was speaking to our European partners inside the Council in an attempt to repair the damage inflicted on our reputation , his finance minister , Charlie McCreevy , was outside describing the Irish rejection of the Nice Treaty as a remarkable and healthy development . #% There must be a parity of esteem between the different sides of the argument ; there must be respect for the divergence of opinion ; but , most importantly of all , we must never forget that lives have been sacrificed needlessly because people refused to talk to each other on an equal basis and on an equal footing . #% Ireland is today , and effectively always has been , a non-aligned country eager to play its own modest role in protecting peace and security around the globe . #% I believe that enlargement should proceed with all speed so that the accession countries can not only share in the benefits of European Union membership , but also contribute fully to the debate on the kind of European Union we hope to build . #% Biodiversity is at risk , but there is also a need to ensure that urban , transport and infrastructure planning does take climate change into account . #% However , that said and giving credit where credit is due , we must also recognise that there are a lot of deficiencies within the common fisheries policy . #% Events of the past month have graphically illustrated what many have sought to highlight over the years about the reality of life in East Timor . #% It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment , an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture . #% But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues : first of all , the fact that there are some diverse standards ; secondly , the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration . #% The European Coal and Steel Community has served energy well and the Euratom Treaty , although anachronistic and definitely a 1957 Treaty , has been a very powerful impetus to one form of energy - nuclear energy . #% Secondly , we should encourage older people to remain at work longer if they so wish . #% I refer of course to the fact that tonight my small country of Northern Ireland famously defeated the mighty football team of Spain at Windsor Park in Belfast . #% I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life . #% On trade and development : my group supports the everything but arms proposition . #% These are aspects that need to be addressed . #% Can the Commission say that it will seek to have sugar declared a sensitive product ? #% Mr President , in relation to the Böge report I speak on behalf of my colleagues in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group : Mrs Doyle , Mr Mitchell , Mr Coveney and Mr Higgins . #% Currently both consumers and retailers have to contend with the fact that goods can be physically moved across the EU in one or two days , yet the payment in relation to these goods can take between three and five days to clear . #% Any actions that we can take here must seek to enforce best practices and ideas . #% The direct aid will solve a lot of the problems we are talking about . #% I would suggest that the direction to take - if the President-in-Office could comment - is to reduce our income tax and social charges which are too high , thereby improving the competitiveness of European industry . #% I think it is fitting today that we are talking about this issue because it is the 50th birthday of Xanana Gusmão , the Timorese resistance leader who is serving a 20-year sentence for opposing the Indonesian rule . #% Indeed , in many areas of disability rights Spanish law is a model that other Member States could usefully follow with regard to integration , access and equal treatment . #% I believe that it is necessary to define the application of the CFP in a clear and consistent manner , setting out a coherent system of regionalisation . #% We allow food imports into the EU and , at the very least , we need to ensure that the standards of our imports meet those of our home-produced food . #% According to estimates by Senegal 's research institute , which was carried out in 1996 , the available resources at that time would permit catches of some 465 000 tonnes . #% There are a number of points that I wish to make today . #% First of all , I would like to say that this is not anti-communism . #% On the contrary , over the past decade , the gap between rich and poor , between the ` haves ' and the ` have nots ' , between the well fed and the hungry has grown even wider . #% It is a pity Mrs Mouskouri could not have sung her report today . #% In conclusion , I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteurs , Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro , for their excellent report . #% Secondly , on the question of transparency and openness -- and people often speak about transparency without fully realising or understanding what it means -- the most transparent thing Parliament , the institutions and the Presidency can do is to deliver on their commitments . #% Most reforms start off as good intentions but can lose their original purpose in Parliament through amendments . #% It supports difficult areas both in the south and north of the Community . #% But , you know , I think if we are going to depend on the car industry - and we are going to totally defend it - then I think we are picking the wrong particular area in which to do this , and certainly General Motors would not be the most important in my area , as far as I would be concerned . #% Mr President , faced with the government of Palestine being in the hands of the terrorist group Hamas and with its refusal to give up violence and to recognise Israel , it seems to me right and necessary that Israel should unilaterally make provision to define and defend its own borders . #% in writing . - Over the last 50 years , European women have made huge progress towards gender equality . #% These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush 's hit list . #% 
The increase in fishing foreseen in the agreement must also be dependent upon unequivocal and independent scientific justification , which must be made available to the Parliament . #% This will ensure a higher quality of education and will also ensure that a stronger foundation is laid to entice new information technology industries to be set up and located within the territories of the European Union . #% This is the sort of lie they tell : ' If you took the measures that are necessary we would live in a life of dimming lights , turning off air conditioning , sacrificing our industrial competitiveness and curtailing our economic growth ' . #% As well as the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq , we also have to rebuild relationships within the EU itself and our credibility in the field of common foreign and security policy , we have to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the UN and , last but not least , we have to rebuild the transatlantic relationship . #% The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for . #% We need to acknowledge ... #% If the police had acted as they should have done four months earlier this situation would not have deteriorated to one where the children 's lives were at risk and where the parent who had abducted was threatening to burn down the house . #% I have no difficulty with the original political decision of the European Union to help the regions , particularly those of Spain and Portugal , that are highly or partly dependent on fishing . #% Above all , we require of you strength and integrity . #% Previous common positions have not yet been implemented in all Member States , while the threat posed to children 's safety by greater technological progress continues to mount . #% Why are we having these draconian measures placed upon our farmers when they do not need it or want it , and when all they want to do is produce good food ? #% Regarding energy , equivalent funding for renewables and nuclear is required . #% We place a very strong emphasis in the Liberal Group - and I am glad to say the rapporteur will take our only amendment to this report - on recalling the necessity as we develop our thesis about universality of service , quality of service and so on - and these issues are extremely important - of not abandoning our commitment - and , indeed , the treaty requirement - to have regard to competition . #% We are currently facing a refugee crisis in the area and many regimes are turning on their own people . #% Do you not think it strange that the countries that do not want to harmonise tax are the countries that have the highest growth rate , the lowest unemployment , the highest investment in infrastructure and the lowest personal tax ? #% The new draft guidelines provide for continued distinctive treatment of Northern Ireland as an economic development region and therefore allow ongoing aid to attract inward foreign investment on a reducing scale through to 2011 . #% The maximum penalty of not less than eight years should apply in the case of child pornography and aiding and abetting such crimes , including the exploitation of children , when they involve a child below the age of 16 . #% They also want to focus on the external implications of employment and social policies , particularly in relation to the enlargement process . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to welcome President Barroso and the Members of the Commission to the Chamber . #% Ease of mobility is needed if we are ever to achieve the proclaimed objectives of the Lisbon Summit . #% Last June 150 countries adopted a global UN strategy to tackle the worldwide drug problem . #% That should have been the line to take : if they are dangerous then they should be banned , rather than saying ` they may cause problems ' . #% Madam Chairman , I share the disappointment expressed in this report at the inadequacy of the Commission 's response to the crisis in the fishing industry , but I will not pretend to be surprised . #% Considering that he is part of a government that has taken such a strong line on international terrorism , the way in which he has ducked the issue -- his cop-out here this evening -- is totally amazing . #% Mr President , EU leaders met in Ghent on 21 September to evaluate how the Union should react to the horrific terrorist attacks in America . #% These innovations will help to reduce CO2 emissions , fuel consumption and noise pollution . #% Small stable rural communities could subsist on the natural resources in their environment without depleting them . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply and I welcome the proposal to prepare a new regulation . #% I have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving . #% One of the most important factors when we look at the creation of new offices or new institutions under the European Treaties is that there are a number of elements that have to be remembered first and foremost . #% Mr President , I should firstly like to express my thanks for the cooperation I received in the preparation of this report , not only from the Commission but also from colleagues on the committee , where we were involved in extremely good cooperation in bringing forward compromise amendments . #% On balance I feel we must accept it and support your team . #% They want to see positive developments and I am suggesting tonight that there is a number of positive things that we can do within this Parliament . #% Commissioner , I am very interested in what you said . #% We must adopt a flexible approach to ensure that Europe can remain competitive in the world market and global market in which we now live . #% On the ICBAN board there are twenty members , only three of whom are now from the unionist community . #% In fact , in my own country , we deal very effectively with this matter through the tax system . #% Madam President , incoming members need to realise that their membership of the EU will not remove the great difficulties they already have in their agriculture industries . #% It is completely unacceptable that far-reaching decisions have been taken by the Council of Justice and Home Affairs ministers when there has been no debate in this Parliament on the subject . #% The level of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe is still a barrier to job creation . #% We have no difficulty with the `` polluter pays '' principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level . #% When these countries join the European Union they will bring a new impetus , a new ideology , and a new belief in the vision the founding fathers of the European Union had of a Europe of peace , prosperity , progress and respect for Europe 's diversity . #% I am not happy about the whole procedure . #% It respects our rules in Parliament on the new comitology procedure . #% The problem we are dealing with here is deeply ingrained in our society , not just in far-off , distant societies which have particular religious views in relation to women . #% After purchasing CDs from a renowned high street store , namely HMV , I received an incomplete order with a promise of further delivery . #% Their application so far has gone nowhere . #% However , we are living in a modern world , where there are real terrorism threats both to Europe and to other parts of the world , on which the European Union must take a position . #% Regarding the subject of the report - the safe and humane transport of animals - we all accept without hesitation that this is a fundamental requirement . #% By contrast , the rapporteur Mrs Liotard has worked hard to add some substance to the proposal . #% For that reason the time has come for this Parliament to consider whether or not it can recreate direct access to Strasbourg . #% This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures . #% Whatever we do , we must not penalise those who most need our aid , money and assistance . #% Farmers and sheep farmers in Ireland have always made the point that the sheepmeat regime does not create common conditions throughout the European Union . #% I realise this is a domestic issue , but it helps to point out a failure in the existing cohesion policy . #% Now is the time for people to stand up and show their true democratic principles ; to show that they believe in the rule of law ; that they believe in justice and equality and parity of esteem for all people in all families . #% There is a scarcity of donations in my own country and many others . #% With regard to 2 other dates I did not receive any daily allowance for the Parliament and these facts have been confirmed in writing to me by the EP services . #% I look forward to further details of this plan and hope that it can form the basis for meaningful negotiations . #% There is a need for an independent , centralized European organization to which all missing children should be reported . #% We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine , which sent out the wrong signal , allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say ` There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money ' . #% Their earnings are taken by traffickers , they are unable to speak the language and they are oppressed by the fear and the secrecy that surrounds this issue . #% The EUR 308 billion for 2007-2013 will go largely to the new Member States . #% Anyone who argues the opposite is playing to the gallery of populism , rather than dealing with substance and fact . #% Take , for example , the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy : despite all the fine words and the good proposals put forward by the Commission , it is clear , when you actually look at what has come out , that this is really a shadow of what was proposed . #% I am pleased to see our new Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio . #% 
In relation to Vietnam , we call on the authorities to promote and to allow a multi-party system to reflect different viewpoints , to end all repression of religious minority groups such as the unified Buddhist church and to release Vietnamese political prisoners of conscience . #% I would like in conclusion to ask you , Commissioner , about the goals and the timetable for the addition of extra organic chemicals to the list of POPs as set out under the Convention , which were discussed last August . #% If amendments are necessary in the light of new developments , no doubt the Commission will come back with further proposals and I am quite certain that the Committee and Parliament will respond expeditiously . #% In short , can you give us an assurance that you will make an effort to have the fishermen involved in any recovery plans ? #% There is no word here that EU arms supplied around the world are the cause of many of the disputes which we talk about settling . #% The Commission is proposing to extend the MAGP by one more year in order to debate fleet policy in the context of the Green Paper . #% There is no doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross-border and North-South initiatives funded under this programme . #% It should be given much more emphasis in our strategy . #% I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed , transported and slaughtered . #% Despite the good words and the good intentions , I have three separate conclusions about what we saw last weekend , what we read in the papers from Britain , what we have seen in the news media over the last few days and what Mr Brown said in his speech last night . #% Mr President , over the summer I took the opportunity to be briefed by some of those in industry in my region . #% The House has made it clear from the beginning that we expect strict rules to be applied in the whole area of producing , packaging and marketing cigarettes and other tobacco products . #% After all , when we are talking about vaccination , we talk about cattle only , but it was the transport of sheep in the UK , Ireland , France and elsewhere that actually spread the disease the last time , and we must not lose sight of that . #% It also fails to set up a mechanism to sort out difficulties and problems arising from a Member State 's refusal to enforce the arrest warrant outside the specific areas that it excludes . #% If adopted , this model will simultaneously result in the collapse of stocks and the collapse of the market . #% Ireland achieves about 98 % compliance with the current Directive , but it is clear that not enough is being done to ensure proper standards in water quality , and environmental standards generally . #% I therefore rejected the first part of the paragraph , and because the plenary voted overall in favour of that paragraph , I voted against this report in the final vote . #% Mr President , the Treaty of Nice is dead and must not be given the kiss of life . #% I am glad that the overwhelming vote here this morning was in favour of the joint resolution which was drawn up and approved by representatives of all the major political groups . #% . Mr President , as one of the 26 MEPs who attended the world trade talks I would agree with the Commissioner that there was some success -- it was not a complete failure . #% Already the fall-out from BSE has cost farmers millions of pounds and left consumers both confused and bewildered . #% In fact , if I had my way , he would not even have been allowed in Parliament . #% At the moment we spend 1.11 % of Community GDP and we have written a great volume on the whole question of how we are to collect this money . #% I wonder whether we could put names and faces on that downsizing . #% But , if we go down the route of identifying and tagging each individual sheep , apart altogether from a flock identification tag , and then removing it when the lamb goes to the fattener , we could be left with sheep with three or four tags , or you would be removing tags and adding others : something we are trying unsuccessfully to sort out in Ireland at the moment . #% Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , we agree that after Lisbon we need a knowledge-based economy . #% This is the second attempt at an EU landfill directive . #% Does the Commission agree that there is an urgent need for common security standards for all nuclear installations , not just in the EU-15 , but in accession countries as well ? #% The Haitian Ambassador attended when I launched that particular book . #% An open skies agreement , reducing stacking and taxiing time through better air traffic control management and improved scheduling and coordination within a single European sky policy must all be part of a comprehensive policy mix . #% Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely , and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights . #% I suspect from your speech , Mr Blair , that you are not prepared to face the real questions that arise from that . #% I continue to be perplexed at our Taoiseach 's attempt to once again play the neutrality card in Barcelona in an effort to get the Nice Treaty supported . #% Those responsible for such abuses should not go unpunished . #% I know some progress has been made in identifying the virus , but what progress has been made in identifying a vaccine for us ? #% This is necessary as Member States add to or change their own legislation in this area and as European Court judgments point out anomalies or clarify certain Articles . #% Mr President , I am sure that you are going to mention it and I am sure colleagues will share our joy in Ireland at the ratification of both our referenda . #% There are plenty of criticisms to make of Nice with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states , but for people who are fair-minded and rational , none of the criticisms should be that it went too far . #% The prime objective of all legislation should be to allow the internal market to function without cross-border obstacles to the growth of industries . #% Globalisation is happening and while there are risks it presents us with immense opportunities . #% We have to face the reality that this is going to be extremely difficult to achieve . #% One of my constituents had difficulty in having a blue disabled badge issued in Germany : Mrs Nuttall was informed that she had to be a resident in Germany . #% The appointment of the new millennium Commission , due to take place in January next , we believe , properly is a matter for the new Parliament with a new mandate , with new political balances and with new powers under Amsterdam . #% There is an urgent need now for united action by the European and Canadian trade union movement , with environmental and indigenous activists , to fight together and resist this proposed agreement . #% It will take a lot of courage to stand up to the nonsense that goes on about those pretty animals . #% I very strongly take the view that taxation issues should remain the preserve of the individual Member State governments . #% Please , MEPs , do not try to tell your constituents that it is the economic boom in Ireland that is taking jobs out of your constituencies . #% Furthermore , President Jiang 's plea to Macau 's government not to allow criticism of Beijing raises fundamental questions about the Chinese Government 's commitment to allow freedom of expression which is fundamental to the success of the one-country two-systems policy . #% However , this sort of thing should not happen in this House and we should organise our debates more efficiently . #% Therefore the willingness of a borrower to deal with a foreign lender will be determined not only by the competitiveness of the mortgage , but also by the level of consumer protection that will apply to the foreign lender . #% Now the Commission has proposed the removal of this provision in the revised regulation . #% Secondly , the Council is paying little or no attention to Parliament 's legitimate and legally enshrined role in the moves towards EMU . #% Studies show this is the most effective way to tackle tax evasion and protect revenues . #% I particularly welcome that he wants to include the social partners and the trade unions in this . #% Such projects should not only be open to the business sector and local groups such as small locally-based co-ops should be assisted in creating such local enterprises . #% in writing . - I was in favour of the recommendation to the Council on the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly , which calls for strengthened EU visibility at the United Nations . #% A further complication is that three DGs are involved in all of this : ENTR , SANCO and indeed AGRI . #% We are giving confused signals . #% This conciliation process must reach an effective agreement . #% You have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat . #% The whole area of innovation , research and development is one that we talk about a lot , but in which concrete legislative action to protect design , patents and copyright , and to allow for proper investment in research and development , in financial terms , is still lacking . #% It is now believed that the depleted uranium rounds were used by the bombers which carried out attacks on the suburbs of Sarajevo and elsewhere during the Balkans war . #% It is important that the European Parliament continue to monitor developments in Hong Kong and this report provides an important update on many issues , not least on Article 23 , the proposed anti-sedition legislation , on which we passed a resolution in December 2002 . #% Security of employment in the future for those who are fortunate to have employment at present is an equally important issue . #% What Rule do we use ? #% Given the crisis in Germany , we need more food labelling , we need more standards ; we need more quality control . #% 
However , the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the US in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science , and it pays off . #% Mr President , first of I all I should like to say that I agree completely with the sentiments and the concerns expressed by my colleague John Cushnahan . #% We will be able to get on with our business , as so overwhelmingly decided by the electorate , and he can get on with his . #% Mr President , on the Péry report , I am most amazed . #% This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants . #% If you decide to be your own man , to be political , then you will do us all a great favour . #% Following on from that , could I urge firstly the President-in-Office to use his good offices and his benign influence on his colleagues within the Council to ensure that there is a strong European Union voice and presence at the United Nations Convention on Disability ? #% Mr President , I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on the tremendous work he has done . #% But , in the view of the Council at this moment in time , for the reasons I have stated , we do not see a role for the Council in triggering the Moscow mechanism . #% It is vital that the emergency services , such as ambulances , police and fire services , arrive at the scene of an accident within the first hour -- the golden hour -- after the accident occurs . #% When we discuss any issues regarding education we have to see this as an investment in the future for our young people to give them the skills to adapt to the changing technologies in the changing world in which we live . #% The arrest of Mr Milosevic is the first important step in bringing him to justice and the authorities in Belgrade must be congratulated for their determination in this regard . #% Parliament recently voted to maintain and increase funding for the SAVE programme . #% Far better that than to increase income tax by 2 % . #% However , let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation - the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act , making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites . #% When Mr Deva asked Commissioner Nielson a question on Mozambique and about the delay in getting helicopters there , it was dismissed out of hand by Commissioner Nielson . #% Mr President , I congratulate the people of France and Holland on bringing deliverance to all those in Europe who value democracy and national liberty . #% Are we doing justice to anyone when we meet a delegation from India , say , or China once a year for one-and-a-half or two days ? #% Madam President , I rise to support the remarks of Mr de Rossa and Mrs McKenna with regard to the horrific situation and tragedy in Wexford , Ireland . #% Mr President , I was part of the delegation with Mr Spencer and Mr Linkohr at the conference in Buenos Aires . #% But we have nothing like a proportionate say and influence in terms of foreign policy . #% There are obvious political and constitutional issues here , which are perhaps more obvious to me , given where I come from , than to some others . #% And whether that means imposing sanctions on all involved until they end their war or offering advantage to those who end it , we who have the capability must act . #% I know that , certainly in the last number of years , the pleasure of going to an airport and boarding an aircraft has deteriorated , not only because of delays for reasons of air traffic control and lack of space , etc. , but also because of delays at airports , baggage retrieval and security - it could be argued that security is necessary . #% This also includes - as the Commissioner can confirm - the possibility of reviewing Article 9 in the light of the findings of that group . #% We should be looking for materials and substances for children 's toys where there is no doubt about safety whatsoever . #% It reconciles work and family life and addresses an important health and safety issue . #% However , I am less supportive of amendments put forward to this proposal which call for the compulsory use of armed in-flight security officers or ` sky marshals ' . #% You can be in a temperature of 115ºF in California and feel comfortable with very little electricity used . #% They were applied for a reason . #% It is a highly destructive proposal , which could put at risk the effectiveness and even the very existence of the European Union . #% We need clear rules to prevent people and organisations from influencing EU decision making in a non-transparent manner . #% Up until August 2003 , 92 women in Ireland were killed over the previous 92 months : one woman per month on average dies in Ireland as a result of so-called domestic disputes . #% I intend , on behalf of my own group , notwithstanding the mission you have conferred on Madame Garaud , to whom again , on behalf of my group , I wish to express our profound sympathy , to take direct personal contact with the Spanish authorities , because we have a right to have an early and urgent answer . #% In doing that you will establish that you , Romano Prodi , come to us not as a bureaucrat , not as a technician , but as someone dedicated to European politics , as a politician , and that as a politician you will lead a strong , independent political Commission . #% Mr President , I can not resist starting by saying it is well-known that my Irish colleague across the way lives in the capital city of Dublin where these sites will not be troubling her too much . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tangible expression of solidarity with workers who have lost their jobs due to major structural changes in world trade patterns . #% Furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral European form of such a tax should be considered . #% Regardless of his much-documented lifestyle off the field , on the soccer field he had a world stature . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work . #% It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten , as he himself has acknowledged , could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers . #% I note that it is estimated that , in those Member States where this is done , around EUR 5 billion a year is raised , in terms of added value , by promoting such geographical indications . #% We can not change the rules half-way through the programmes and we must denounce the hypocrisy of the Council of Ministers of paying lip-service to launch actions on unemployment and then reneging on their commitments to tackle unemployment through structural funds . #% The other institutions should recognise and realise that Parliament is very responsible in arriving at its opinion when it is given time to be consulted . #% Consequently , I could not today vote for the censure motion on the Commission tabled by those who want what I believe to be outrageous measures applied to my country . #% In relation to Iraq itself , Iraq was one of the countries in the region with the most advanced education system , with education for all - male and female alike . #% Arrears for those countries which were at $ 1.2 billion in 1980 have now increased to $ 43 billion . #% We are always hearing that it should be placed at the top of the agenda . #% With regard to this report , I thank the rapporteur for his good work . #% As a result of the implementation of this Directive , the safety of water quality standards in Europe will substantially improve . #% At one stage people said that politics is not that important . #% In seeking to enhance the international role of the Central Bank my group also expects from the bank itself greater transparency in its policy formulation . #% Bland statements such as ` reducing demand is an important aspect ' is not good enough . #% We could adopt the easy way . #% It is clear that the likely direction of the decision-making process within the Parliament and within the European Council is going to be based on codecision and majority voting procedures . #% The dire economic prospects for young people and the anger against corruption and excesses of the tiny dictatorial elite lie at the heart of the revolutionary movements and the aspirations of the Egyptian people . #% In the fight against fraud you proposed a new high-level group to do its work by the end of March . #% It is undeniably the fact that the use of these drugs causes damage to the user ' s health . #% I beg the indulgence of yourself and the House to ask you , Madam President , on behalf of this Parliament , to express our outrage at the capitulation by the British Government , the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the security forces in Northern Ireland in the face of Orange Order mob rule ; also to express our outrage at the first bombing to take place in Northern Ireland in the last two years , which took place at the weekend . #% Mr President , I wish to concentrate my remarks on the issue of terrorism . #% This has to be top priority because too many fish that are taken aboard vessels are discards - and then it is much too late . #% Next October governments will hold a special meeting to consider the establishment of a European area of freedom , security and justice . #% But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single currency on 1 January is a positive step on the road to European integration . #% They have successful experience in this field , and we have a lot to learn from them . #% I want to draw Members ' attention to the fact that I will be distributing that article today for their information . #% 
I make the point because this document was stuffed into my hands coming in the door . #% There have been a number of instances where the independence of the rule of law and the observance of human rights have been called into question . #% Share this process with us as well , not because we want to interfere with your right to make the final call , but because we too are players and we can not be left to one side or not get documents till the eve of a debate . #% I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Secretariat , and to say that safety is something that affects us all . #% Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of this House the findings of a visit I made to Romania to look in particular at the situation of babies and young adults with handicaps in institutional care . #% We need open and honest dialogue and need to look to ourselves internally first . #% It is also important to say that farmers welcome the controls concerning animal food production . #% Thus a funding formula reliant on a smash-and-grab raid on the single farm payment through excessive modulation is simply not acceptable , particularly in circumstances where there is no necessity for matching national funding . #% We need other measures as well as this directive . #% All Member States need to be singing from the same hymn sheet regarding common rules on security checks , searches , surveillance , prohibited items and security patrols , to name just a few . #% Our culture needs to encourage men to step up to the plate . #% I am very aware of the comments that Malcolm Harbour made in his speech and I agree with him , there is huge potential with regard to 3G . #% When a drought in any part of the world can actually cause total confusion in the whole market for everyone else , this is not a situation that we can allow to continue . #% I welcome the decision to allow Greece full participation within the single currency . #% At a national level , EU governments must ensure that their development aid policies are ` conservation-audited ' to support biodiversity and habitat retention . #% It also pressures applicant and Third World countries to become part of an EU market-place for human embryo research . #% The criteria which are used by these ecolabels must be publicly available to all who are interested , and must be detailed and specific . #% Mr President , if ever I doubted the validity of my Euroscepticism , today I discovered that 45 turgid minutes of Eurofanaticism from the Prime Minister of Belgium was the perfect antidote . #% The continent of Europe accounts for about 10 % of all accidents worldwide , while one third of air traffic takes place in European skies . #% In respect of the formation of the Commission itself , I should say that you have my group 's full support . #% For example , it would be almost impossible to treat a pig-breeding and fattening unit of , say , 5 0-10 000 pigs in any other way than in feed and drinking water . #% I also think that there is a lot of hypocrisy and double-speak in this House . #% People have already waited long enough . #% However , the Council and the Commission have responded to the concerns which Parliament raised and brought forward a new proposal and a new team , which we now have the responsibility to endorse . #% This action must be taken sooner rather than later to alleviate the pressure that has been put on ordinary people . #% As you yourself know , Taoiseach , those in Ireland who are critical of the EU are so mainly because of the military implications of this Constitution . #% Of course , these scams represent no value whatsoever to the consumer or businesses . #% Mr President , my first reaction to Mrs Hautala 's report is to ask why the Committee on Economic Affairs and Industrial Policy was given the task of dealing with a subject that belongs more appropriately , in my opinion , to the Committee on Agriculture and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism . #% The report therefore calls for a rejection of the initiative of the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain . #% The issues , arising from multi-billion-euro losses in the '80s and the '90s , many related to asbestos , can only be dealt with satisfactorily through the establishment of a committee of inquiry . #% A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable . #% This is something which will appeal to the public . #% I hope that this report represents the first stage in a concerted battle against this type of fraud . #% That industry wants to expand this year , next year and the year after . #% To me it sounds incredible that we can find billions to inflict the torture of war on humanity and still not have the resources to address the basic human needs of those living in the depths of poverty and despair . #% We should all recall that this story emanated in the United States , where there is deep unease about what may be happening . #% Taking the long-term view in the context of Agenda 2000 , we must ensure that family farms and their individual enterprises are supported within the available budget resources . #% I am pleased to say that remedial action has been taken and we look forward to an enhanced programme in this very important sector . #% We are not yet as transparent as we could be or ought to be on our individual group and collective expenditures financed by public purse . #% I fully agree that food must be traceable through all stages of the food chain , from farm to table . #% We feel strongly that a real initiative to prevent injury and promote safety is so important that it needs to be put on its own stream within the health programmes . #% That is why I welcome the presence of Mr Prodi at this early stage and the dialogue we start . #% We need a level playing field for conservation measures taken against small fishing fleets and those taken against deep-sea fishing . #% I would also like to confirm that our group would be reluctant to support the amendment proposed by the PPE Group for the reasons just mentioned by other speakers . #% I urge all Members to support the retention of these important programmes . #% I strongly support this trend . #% I want to have an answer from the President-in-Office before I ask my supplementary . #% It is most regrettable that the Council described the situation in this way . #% Finally , I hope that with both this Commission initiative and the introduction of the single currency , we will witness more transparency , more shopping around by consumers and , consequently , the eventual creation of a real single market in insurance . #% Whatever the reform , it is vitally important that smaller Member States retain their right to nominate a Member of the Commission . #% I would hope that the Commission will take this on board . #% I am particularly pleased that the presidency succeeded in putting sustainable development at the core of European politics . #% But I am convinced that I can bring the majority of Irish people on board with me , and in every other Member State it is the same thing . #% We welcome that , but the standing veterinary committee seems to be engaged in delaying tactics . #% The ELDR believes that we need to focus more urgent attention on asylum and immigration . #% It is also crucial that we adopt a qualitative , value-for-money approach with the resources that we have . #% On the question of food security and food quality , we must ensure , and I think this is important in the context of the next world trade talks , that the European Union commitment to consumer protection does not place our consumers at risk or place our industry at a competitive disadvantage . #% Aung San Suu Kyi has asked for sanctions but we have done absolutely nothing about this . #% Longer-term financial assistance is required , and EU governments must take the political decisions to make these broader financial commitments available to the Iranian Government . #% The proposal is essentially a humanitarian response to the need to offer protection on a temporary basis to individuals fleeing a country in significant numbers as their lives are in imminent danger . #% The Union must continue to implement uniform and rights-led programmes of education relating to new information technologies , so that all citizens of the Union can be properly integrated into the workplace . #% I met with ambassadors in Tel Aviv , moved on to Jerusalem to meet Israeli peace groups and then on to Jenin to talk to the residents there . #% There comes a time within a negotiation when the kid gloves must come off , when action must be taken . #% I should like to ask for clarification on the question of the amount of money to be allocated this year . #% It may be exciting to insiders , but outside , as he well knows , it is hardly mentioned in the newspapers . #% The common fisheries policy goes too far . #% 
In addition , I am pleased that she has referred to discards . #% The Council dodged the issue ; we should not . #% We must focus on polices which will improve European competitiveness and productivity , while investing more on research and new product development . #% As long as I have been here in Parliament we have observed the awful dangers that many children in the world live in : a litany of miseries which are listed in this resolution here today . #% The Council has today released its conclusions on Sudan and the UN Human Rights Council is trying to get an assessment mission into Darfur as we speak , so the international focus is on Darfur right now . #% If the rapporteur 's proposals are accepted , however , I would still emphasize the need for detailed examination of the programme and monitoring of the expenditure . #% We have seen appalling weather incidents this summer which have cost lives and caused devastation right across the world . #% As regards the role of the common foreign and security policy , it is clear that Parliament and the EU institutions are obsessed with the development of a common defence policy , yet the question of whom we are defending ourselves against has never been clearly answered . #% The problem has been identified and is being solved and the good news is that the system is now working . #% Far too often the concerns and interests of our peoples are ignored in the headlong rush to advance the federalist agenda exemplified in the Lisbon Treaty . #% It could also fund other essential tools for job creation in areas where our agricultural and fishing industries are struggling to survive . #% Firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that . #% Proposals to tighten ELVs are not proportionate regarding costs and benefits and fail to recognise that the common position is a balance between improving environmental performance and avoiding excessive costs and other impacts . #% My main priority has been to achieve legal certainty for industry . #% I hope it will be sustained . #% Madam President , Mr Varela 's report is on a very important and interesting subject -- that of the tuna industry . #% The euro is a strong currency for business and it is succeeding , but we must analyse the rules governing economic coordination . #% The Council gave scant regard to over 50 amendments adopted by this House in the first reading . #% As everybody knows it received massive backing by all the people on the island of Ireland only last week . #% 2003 is a repeat of 2002 is a repeat of 2001 is a repeat of 2000 . #% To date , many of the actions taken to deal with BSE have been carried out on a unilateral basis by Members using national measures . #% It has never been allowed before , and it would certainly mean the end of the Irish sugar industry . #% Were there crimes ? #% Tonight he has made his best speech ever in the House . #% It can not be right , after 11 September , to continue to stockpile and increase the stockpile of hundreds of tonnes of plutonium . #% Certainly this is something which we as a presidency will try to advance as best we can during our six months in office . #% Many are now close to bankruptcy . #% We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues -- and in particular by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten -- are taken on board and dealt with . #% I led an SR Technics delegation to meet Commissioner Špidla in mid-2009 , when the availability of this fund was confirmed to us . #% I am particularly anxious to hear an answer concerning the initiatives they hope to undertake during the Danish presidency . #% I have strong reservations in relation to up to five of the Commissioners , but based on his curriculum vitae and experience , Mr Buttiglione has the ability and aptitude for the job of Commissioner . #% The provisions of Nice are part and parcel of the ground rules on which the candidate countries are negotiating their membership of the Union . #% We would instead like to see public money work more intelligently , both alongside private investment and through better public procurement . #% It was long overdue , but now that it has happened , it is hugely welcome . #% The EU Member States present at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva this month should take a clear position in order to undermine the material profits of those who help to undermine the lives of defenders of human rights , trade union groups and environmentalists . #% I fully endorse the statement that violence and peace can not coexist . #% De-coupling , modulation , degressivity and cross-compliance in place of good farming practice and an honest return for honest endeavours . #% I have seen situations where a large number of people from a particular sector , which is well financed by the Union , seem to be able continuously to get away with violations of our rules and regulations on the spending of money . #% On 29 October the General Affairs Council agreed that the basis of the EU approach on the subject at the Singapore conference would be the following : ' The EU considers that the Singapore conference should address the following issues : the role of trade liberalization in increasing living standards worldwide and , in this context , the importance that World Trade Organization members attach to the efforts of the ILO to promote the better definition and universal observance of core labour standards . #% Improvements to car standards and cleaner fuels are a necessity . #% Looking at the philosophical principles that create peace , what the peoples of Europe did was to build institutions - and those three institutions are represented here today - which fully respect the differences of their peoples . #% It is not true to say , as Mr Chichester implies , that this has been completely solved , that everyone knows exactly how to do it and how much it costs . #% As he is in the Chamber tonight , I want him to appreciate that serious statement of concern by European citizens . #% The idea is that cross-border shoppers can contact this address if they have problems . #% In the first year , 2005 , the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated in those 21 countries . #% How much time and resources will be committed to detailed scrutiny of biotech inventions ? #% We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world . #% The underlying basis of all of this , the polluter pays principle , is one that we should be pushing most of all here . #% Had all those things been discussed , the optimism would have been much less . #% Maybe the Commission should look at the levels of grant aid . #% If we are going to insist on retrospective labelling , how will they be able to compete ? #% That serves only to increase the number of poultry reared in appalling conditions . #% Madam President , I wish to clear up a misapprehension . #% It depends on information which is given to it by the national police forces , on cooperation with those forces and also on the requests from those forces for it to undertake action . #% I was the butt of - as Mrs Pollack has said - some of the most ferocious lobbying ever seen in this Parliament . #% Your party colleague , Mr Gerard Collins , was correct in saying that everything can continue under the existing rules . #% On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , I would like to the European Commission . #% Coming from Ireland , which tries to sell itself as the ` Food Island ' , I believe the marketing and job-creation potential of organic products is enormous . #% In some of the opinions annexed to the report there are entirely different descriptions of the industry at European level than the one he gives . #% I can not therefore accept Mr Hughes ' amendment which would place too many constraints on the fishing industry . #% The Commission can be assured that my group and the Regional Affairs Committee and others will be most supportive of the proposals when they come on stream . #% There were reasons for imposing such stringent measures in the first place . #% There is no equity in that . #% There is just a note of caution I wish to give my colleagues in Parliament . #% So it is not that people are disconnected from concerns about the world , but they certainly do not necessarily see any relevance in being asked to vote for the European Parliament , or indeed in some cases for national parliaments . #% I firmly believe that European competitiveness will only improve when , in Ireland for example , businesses and consumers can make a payment from Dublin to Madrid as easily as from Dublin to Cork . #% 
However , at the end of the day , as politicians , we have to find a way of achieving a democratic political solution to the problem . #% Finally , I do not believe that anyone would seriously contest our aim of reaching a situation in which our higher levels of prosperity are copper-fastened and ensured on a permanent and sustainable basis . #% Certainly there are very serious food shortages . #% It was not exactly as Mr Casaca said , but it withdrew after the 200-mile limit was extended . #% I indicated that I wanted to make my explanation of vote in writing and I was told that I would have to be here for the vote in the first instance and that I would have to wait until I was called to indicate that I wanted to make it in writing . #% I just want to make a couple of points . #% As regards the rural development pillar , the Commission is expected to propose compulsory modulation from direct payments and this has also been put forward by Mr Färm . #% Since I came to this House in 1984 , Wagonlit has provided an excellent service . #% in writing . - I , along with my Labour colleagues , voted in favour of the Berès report because of my support for the vast majority of its contents . #% For example , the fact there is a big difference in water consumption between hot countries and cold countries is not taken into account when discussing how much water people drink . #% Mr President , in today 's world it is clear that consumers are more informed and more demanding . #% In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials . #% The cause of Irish Republicanism must be completely separated from common criminality now and in the future . #% As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union . #% An awful lot of people right round the world look to Europe as the only transnational , democratic institution that has the capacity to try to rein in the forces that they see destroying the world . #% It means that men and the policy-makers are going to have to look at the way society is structured . #% in writing . - The common agricultural policy ( CAP ) has the potential to offer solutions to many of the problems currently affecting European farms , and this is obvious in no EU Member State more than in Ireland , where there is an equal commitment to both secure a fair and full CAP agreement and to move forward by implementing the changes necessary in 21st century farming . #% I call not just for the Games but for the tourism spin-off to be managed and organised in such a way that every region of the UK will benefit . #% I would hazard a guess that if my constituents were to be asked if this represents 100 million well spent at this time , few - if any - would say yes . #% We would have blocked them if we could have done so . #% There were at least 70 people in the Chamber . #% It was a very useful development of thinking in the area of services of general interest , trying to define some of the territory and to mark out what is appropriate for the European Union . #% For a while that looked unlikely , so I thank everybody who worked so hard to ensure that it did . #% All that has been gained is that this issue ends up in conciliation and brings us no nearer to achieving the real goal of securing information and consultation for the employees of the European Union over the running of their companies . #% Let us work with real issues not with esoteric issues concerning political point-scoring . #% Regrettably that proviso did not appear in any part of yesterday 's article , nor in quotations . #% By analogy we already have at the moment within the European Community initiatives like the Leader programme and the Urban programme where this bottom-up approach has been proven to be successful , and has resolved some of the problems that have been faced . #% Madam President , I also welcome today 's vote on copyright and the information society . #% If you allow it to happen in one Member State , it is the thin end of the wedge : it is going to happen in other Member States as well . #% In the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland there is a high preponderance of conacre lettings , whereby an active farmer rents land for ten months each year from an inactive landowner . #% That is something we need to address . #% If we attempt to undermine the terrorists by using means which themselves destroy freedom , we undermine the very foundations of our own society . #% To some extent we have lost track of what we have been trying to do . #% However , to my great surprise and disappointment , I believe Members will not be able to vote on that amendment . #% The launch of the new euro currency will certainly help to reduce business costs for small and medium-sized enterprises as foreign exchange transactions in eleven countries become an event of the past . #% Finally , I want to put on the record that I object in the strongest terms to threats to the marine environment around the Irish and other north-west European coastlines posed by the so-called ` Ghost Fleet ' of clapped-out American ships being sent to British scrapyards . #% There was no conceivable argument against use or about the possible dangers that might occur that she did not invoke . #% These concerns should be comprehensively addressed in 1997 because there will not be any single currency unless it has popular support in all of those countries whose governments now aspire to join the euro-zone from day one . #% We do not find the answers in here . #% I am not taking a belligerent approach with regard to the operation of EMU criteria , but we can not allow the situation to go on forever where countries are running up large budget deficits and are clearly in breach of so-called strict rules governing the operation of the single currency regime . #% In Ireland , for example , military goods can be exported to China , as long as they are not sold directly to the military . #% Agriculture , which has been going through a very difficult period , has the potential through biomass to contribute positively to rebalancing the renewable energy deficit within the European Union . #% However , for some reason those who lobby in favour of Mrs Breyer 's group are not lobbyists and , apparently , those who have a different point of view are lobbyists and thus decried . #% This illustrates the need for better cooperation between law enforcement agencies in various Member States . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his very comprehensive reply . #% In other words , Parliament 's power of co-decision in this area is important as a tangible example of the way European Parliament decisions can affect people 's lives . #% Madam President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Bontempi on his report . #% He will see the impact of that disappointment and anger in the days to come . #% There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high , and , basically scientific advice has not been followed . #% This decision will allow the PEACE measures , designed to support reconciliation , to be carried on for another few years . #% This is of such fundamental importance to European citizens that regrettably this has prevented me from voting in favour of this report . #% If there is a clear division , then there should be a free choice . #% Mr President , it is hard to do justice to the extreme injustice of this decision in one minute but I will try to portray to Members the conversations Mrs Kinnock and I had in Washington last week . #% I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks . #% It is important to put on the record that , while EU consumers always had access to quality food , the effectiveness of new controls and greater transparency in the food chain provide the additional safeguards necessary to allay fears resulting from isolated incidents and indeed the unforgivable incident which this House is addressing this morning . #% Staging posts were originally introduced as a disease-control measure when the problems concerning BSE were first discovered . #% This is exactly what the Dalai Lama has reiterated today to be his approach and that of the Tibetan people . #% In the past few months the political process in Kosovo has suffered serious reversals and has not progressed . #% The ICES press release of Monday , which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned , shows that stocks are in grave danger . #% And while Europe busies itself with such decisions , the competitiveness of the global markets will mean investors simply move on . #% There is already a situation where people are dying because they are immune to antibiotics . #% A critically important aspect of the launch of the new currency will be the attitude of individual citizens to the euro . #% We have just debated the bathing water directive and it is quite incredible to think that we are talking here about a Member State of the EU irresponsibly posing a major threat to our bathing waters and also to our fishing industry . #% So can I just be very clear : we insist no loopholes are created by not possible derogations , exceptional derogations . #% I have a number of concerns which include a major doubt about the legal bases ; serious questions concerning the lack of protection and safeguards , particularly the use of surveillance measures and coercive methods ; permitting evidence to be used that would be inadmissible in an Irish court ; undermining Irish Constitutional protection for defendants ; allowing self-incrimination . #% I herald the confidence-building measures proposed in this report , in particular the joint monitoring cell for the sharing of data on seismic activity to provide early warning against possible earthquakes . #% 
I firmly believe that if European citizens and businesses are to reap the full benefits of this internal market , then they have to be able to trust in efficient , cheap and secure payments . #% Suddenly we discover that even more demands are being made on the European agricultural sector . #% So I started off my political life with the parish plan in my hand and today I have another Parish plan . #% To date the International Fund for Ireland has contributed EUR 803 million of funding and has leveraged a further EUR 1.46 billion in supporting 5700 projects and the creation of 55 000 direct and indirect jobs . #% I accept his right to his strongly-held orthodox Catholic views . #% The issue of most widespread concern is employment , both the provision of employment opportunities for those without work and the improvement of job security for those currently at work . #% With regard to recital E in the compromise text I should like just to point out that I was not involved in the negotiations and I wonder if there would be any way of getting agreement on a change because there is an inaccuracy . #% The Member States which let France go ahead with its nuclear tests all have dirt on their hands , so we can not take the moral high ground here . #% The protocol does not explain where and how fingerprinting will be done . #% If , as the companies producing them say , there are no health risks , why should we not have a mandatory health indemnity ? #% What we must avoid is imposing restrictive legislation that will hamper free trade and competition and cause damage to a thriving health store sector . #% Tragically , she was proved right . #% Under the new rules , all Member States will be able to avail of such EU funding to improve the conditions of marginalised households previously unavailable to Member States which joined since 2004 . #% I appeal to the House to talk to the Irish Government about its treatment of people with disabilities and their families . #% For example , has anybody done a study on the recent reform of the sugar industry in the EU to see if the decimation of the EU sugar industry has benefited those in Third World countries or if it has just benefited the sugar barons and landowners while leaving the small sugar growers in poverty ? #% I refer later on to the Fed formula . #% I wanted to defend this Parliament ... #% I also congratulate Ambassador Anderson and the Irish civil service . #% I have to say I am relieved that Mr Clark and Mr Helmer find the report irrelevant , because I was afraid that there was so much praise for the report and that I must have done something wrong , if they also found it acceptable . #% Can we oblige those countries to live up to their obligations under the Single European Act ? #% They do not need to be protected from themselves and they do not like being treated as children and being asked to leave the room when sex is being discussed . #% The latest media reports that airlines are reducing fuel costs by recycling unfiltered air into passenger cabins are equally alarming for all of us who travel frequently and , more particularly , for the cabin staff and pilots . #% This regulation demonstrates the added value that the European Union can provide in terms of rights for European citizens . #% The US invasion of Afghanistan was undertaken not to advance the interests of the Afghan people but the geostrategic interests of the United States in Central Asia , which of course is rich in energy , oil and gas . #% The local papers blamed the European Union . #% Finally , I have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place . #% This should be of particular concern . #% But your credibility is somewhat questioned by the fact that our President , Mr Gil-Robles , is not invited to the meeting this afternoon . #% I feel that this is an issue at which EU governments should look carefully so as to ensure that they can build the necessary infrastructure projects in the transport , energy and telecommunications fields . #% I would urge the Commission to bear this in mind during the forthcoming negotiations . #% It should also allow for greater transparency and accountability . #% With 3,000 miles of coastline around Ireland , the possibility of illicit drug smuggling is always present . #% I know that Mrs Zrihen , our socialist shadow , who unfortunately can not be here this evening , appreciated the way in which he worked . #% We must now focus on other areas . #% We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business . #% We are proposing the setting up of a policy advisory committee , as is the practice in country domain names , to assist in dealing with what can be registered at top level . #% Children are our future . #% For them , this is the second year of closure . #% We welcome the commitment to an urgent review of that process . #% If we look at the dates of the various pieces of legislation that Mr Cashman has mentioned in his report , we see that they are all at least 30 years old . #% I made representations on behalf of several of those people , but to no avail . #% In light of this , we should not lose sight of the promise made in the report , ` to guarantee ( people living from fishing ) an equitable standard of living . ' #% However , as far as the free movement of people is concerned , there has been little or no real progress to date in removing border restrictions . #% Given Ireland 's geographical circumstances , aviation is a critical element of our infrastructure , with air services being of vital importance for economic and social reasons . #% In a matter as weighty as this it is not right , on whoever ' s part - and I do not know who is to blame for this leak - to seek a route which chooses the sensational over the institutional management of this issue . #% Before I make my comments I would like to wish the Irish Government well in their application to have Irish recognised as an official working language in the EU . #% Those who oppose the European Union would like to use the events of the last couple of months to highlight disagreement and discord between the existing Member States of the European Union . #% Clearly the tens of millions of pounds sterling it is estimated are being taken annually from its illegal trade in laundered fuel is enough to ensure that the political representatives remain indifferent to such criticism . #% The cost advantages that these countries have will not go away . #% Secondly , you must have targets and you must monitor them . #% Unfortunately , in the United Nations yesterday , the United States vetoed the United Nations mandate for Sfor in Bosnia , in which many EU countries are participating . #% It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area . #% We also must not compromise that principle of excellence . #% What did they know about sanctions ? #% That is why I voted against the report : it is a really bad idea . #% Thus local employers , employees and , ultimately , local consumers , would be the losers . #% There probably is a problem in interpretation here . #% Not all aspects of energy are included in this framework . #% Commissioner , could you just clarify for me , in your comments regarding the Vaxholm case , that you are not in a position to comment ? #% Certainly she has been sick and has gone to several hospitals for treatment during this difficult time . #% For my Group , I could agree entirely with the words of Senator George Mitchell of the United States , who for almost three years also made a significant personal contribution to the search for peace in Northern Ireland . #% Firstly , it does not start on time . #% In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free . #% My third point , and I am sure it has already been made by my colleague , Georg Jarzembowski , is whether the Commission would respond positively to our repeated request for the establishment of a delegation office in Taiwan . #% Clever people of Europe , the money is on its way ! #% Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for the open manner in which he chose to present his report in plenary . #% 
By increasing energy efficiency measures alone by 2020 , we can reduce demand by over 20 % . #% in writing . - This directive is one of the first legislative responses of the EU for the financial crisis . #% I particularly liked the fact that he not only clearly identified human rights abuses , he also identified and praised efforts to end such abuses where these efforts are being made . #% The basis of the proposal is that account is taken exclusively of scientific reports as regards management measures . #% Finally , in the context of enlargement , the EU must ensure adequate aid for family farmers - the backbone of our rural communities - and , in addition , specific aid to young farmers to ensure the survival of our rural communities and our agricultural sector . #% I should have had a reply on 25 April but still have not received one . #% One should recall that the Council had originally proposed an exemption for a period of some 13 years before doctors in training would secure the benefits of the directive . #% It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it . #% Madam President , there are many aspects of this report which I support because it addresses serious problems in relation to women 's health . #% The European Union is now a major source of finance for the fund . #% In my view , no deal better than a bad deal . #% The freedom to live , work or study abroad must mean just that - freedom - and not hidden barriers . #% Decoupling is a central tenet and is quite revolutionary in itself . #% It is fortunate that the watchdogs of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will be there to protect fish stocks and also , but equally as importantly , to protect the interests of fishermen from areas , where , as I said at the outset , there is no alternative source of employment . #% I supported the amendments aimed at promoting cooperation rather than the open method of cooperation . #% As I said earlier , when it is acting in the latter role , there is clearly a difference than when it is acting in its role as legislator . #% Contrary to what has been said by the previous speaker , I am happy to tell you that a specialized unit has been opened in the prisons in Dublin . #% There are people making huge amounts of money by dealing in arms , by ensuring that countries and people can actually get arms from the arms suppliers . #% It seems to have been used as a bargaining chip , and it has taken no account of a sector that employs more than 60 000 fisherman and provides for some 400 000 jobs in the industry in that area . #% I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur and all the draftsmen on their work on what may appear to be a very simple topic but , when you get into the detail and analysis of it , proves extremely difficult . #% I also thank Commissioner Dimas . #% In Ireland , 91 % of submissions were actually against the fluoridation of water . #% A `` yes '' vote is a vote to reunite Europe . #% We must continue with the dialogue . #% I thank him for his response with regard to the chemical industry and also to the agreements established in Central America , the Caribbean and Latin America and the forthcoming agreement with Asia . #% We should look at sign language , at Braille , at all these things that are necessary and allow them to be part of the educational curriculum in all the Member States . #% You can not have prosperity without peace and stability . #% It is about time that they , along with other countries throughout the world , got rid of their nuclear arsenals . #% The 22 million Iraqi people have already suffered enormous pain and loss . #% These new roles -- of selling the Treaty , of ensuring that the citizens understand its benefits and of ensuring that we show the peoples of Europe that it does not undermine their own national interests -- will help us guarantee that the European Union functions smoothly . #% As a share of GDP , the EU invests less than the US and Japan in research and development , and venture capital investment is also lacking . #% The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat . #% This is an important debate and I would like to compliment the Commission on its publication of the White Paper on European Governance . #% That is for sure , but first we must put in place a more workable organisation that can deal with 148 members , many of whom do not have the technical expertise and resources to operate at full potential . #% Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange . #% It is a welfare issue , it is a therapeutic issue , it is an economic issue , and it is in every Member State of the EU . #% Its arrogance in relation to its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents also can not be tolerated . #% Availability of supplements should not be restricted for any reason other than safety . #% Mr President , in Ireland last week we saw the horrors of trafficking when a programme was broadcast on RTE television about young women from Romania being trafficked into the EU , and into Ireland in particular . #% Mr President , it is appropriate that we have a debate here on those events ; they are very significant events concerning an issue which we have been concerned about in this Parliament for over 20 years : human rights . #% I am especially pleased that there is now growing international opposition to shipments of nuclear waste from Britain to Japan . #% I hope , therefore , that they are quite clear we will not accept something which cuts the Fifth Framework Programme in real terms in comparison with the Fourth . #% Mr President , we seem to lose sight of the development aspect of the Doha Development Round as it grinds on . #% So we are not being given the right to determine first whether we agree with the principle or not and vote on all the amendments related to that . #% That is what I oppose . #% Clarity : your political vision , as expounded this morning , does not completely satisfy our vision , and you have to expand and think very much about social Europe , the environment and other aspects . #% Madam President , President-in-Office , President of the Commission , Ladies and Gentlemen , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group I should like to begin by acknowledging and congratulating the minister on the considerable number of actual results achieved by the Swedish presidency already , even before it formally concludes its work . #% They will be quite happy to have their tax money used to ensure that the political system remains uncorrupted or becomes corruption-free . #% It is a drug and should be accepted and recognised as such . #% While I acknowledge that the Irish presidency has to tread sensitively in pursuing progress on the draft Constitution , I support Commissioner Prodi 's warning that failure to reach agreement will inevitably lead to the creation of a two-speed Europe . #% I did not , however , support the Group line on issues such as freezing the allowances of MEPs and provision of business class travel for MEPs . #% We are threatening their state of stocks which is going to force us to reduce the turnover of the fishing communities . #% We are left with an anachronistic piece of legislation , the Euratom Treaty , as our main legal base for energy . #% We can not do that unless there are projects that capture the imagination of our talented young people . #% I welcome the ongoing efforts to reform the institutional structures of the Union , which I hope will simplify the decision-making and administrative systems of the Union before enlargement to the East . #% I get the impression that , especially where biofuels are concerned , there is no lack of interest : the research and investment communities are circling , but afraid to take a leap in the dark . #% In 2005 , the National Crime Council found that one in seven women in Ireland have experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical , sexual or emotional nature from their partner . #% We can only , in conciliation , go as far as amendments allow us in second reading . #% Mr President , I wish to speak briefly on the question of the role of fiscal instruments in the energy sector . #% The low-cost model of air travel has been a huge success . #% Will you insist that the information and data sources used to set the targets in the second round of NAPs will be publicly available to allow independent verification and to ensure maximum benefit for the climate and fair competition across the single market ? #% As far as possible serious crime must carry penalties which result in long jail terms . #% This ambiguity in the role and responsibilities of surveyors across Europe needs to be rectified in order to ensure a harmonised system and a level playing field . #% I would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold . #% That family 's case had been reported in the national media , exposing the lack of services for their own children and children in general . #% I have made a complaint to you regarding the illegal waste dumps found in Wicklow . #% 
The farmers of Europe and their incomes are our responsibility . #% Indeed part of my own constituency in Dublin which some might think is a favoured region is one of those . #% The second was one of three cases to lift the immunity of a Member , as it happened I think from Spain . #% It is strange and weird . #% in writing . - I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers . #% I am thinking primarily of the use of DDT against malaria because , despite the best efforts of scientists and their redoubled efforts to find an effective vaccine , this is still many years away . #% My original amendment on this issue at committee stage was not adopted , but its wording could provide a solution to this major problem . #% Finally , I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission representatives for their work and remind all Members that there is another way under the Brussels I Convention and we can put other mechanisms in place . #% I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended . #% Illegal drugs seem to be readily available nowadays both in terms of quantity and variety , particularly to young people . #% I imagine it is the same in Scotland as it is on the west coast of Ireland - a serious mistrust exists . #% We also have a situation where , with the rise of unemployment , many of those who have been brought to Ireland as legal workers are being let go simply because it is no longer convenient for employers to have them . #% With regard to Romania and the situation of children in Romanian institutions , orphanages and foster homes , more work needs to be done ; more action needs to be taken to treat those children as individual human beings with human rights . #% They have a better understanding of fish movements and factors affecting fish stocks than people give them credit for , quite simply because it is essential for their livelihood . #% While glad to welcome many of the reforms now proposed by the Summit I deeply regret the it 's failure to reach agreement on measures for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament . #% The 1996 Hague Convention is an excellent piece of legislation . #% The current corporate social responsibility debate offers business the opportunity to improve its consumer protection as a good business model and selling point , to help business gain the competitive edge and bring commercial benefits , while providing added value to the consumer . #% The provisional IRA has instilled fear into people . #% There has been much talk in national and international media about the auctioning of third-generation mobile phone licences in Europe . #% There is still # 2m outstanding to Irish road hauliers resulting from this strike which must be paid by the French Government immediately . #% But if we allow ourselves to be complacent and say that we can accept a certain percentage of drug addiction , then we have already lost the battle . #% We need special courts that will deal with these issues as quickly as possible to prevent the inevitable trauma , particularly to the children , but also to both parents . #% Last year I was rapporteur for the report on the CFP monitoring system . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone . #% The enormous sea change in legislation alone to comply with the is something that no existing Member State could achieve in such a short time . #% This is , however , a criminal offence , and I would like to see considerably more cooperation between the police forces in all our countries . #% Finally , we have to have the means to match our ambitions for our cohesion policies as Jacques Santer said . #% We are on course to increase our budget to 1.27 % by 1999 . #% I do not know why , but I understand that some of the big groups in this Parliament were not prepared to stand up to the Brazilian Ambassador who lobbied last week in Brussels . #% When he was defence Minister , Ariel Sharon masterminded the ` Operation Peace for Galilee ? invasion in 1982 . #% The Italian Government needs to be commended for accelerating the pace of these negotiations , and the holding of this recent meeting in Naples was a very timely one . #% In my own Member State , citizens advice bureaux are acting as a clearing-house . #% Mr President , I have worked very closely with my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and I feel that this compromise package of amendments , which we are going to vote on today , is the best outcome we could have hoped for on integrated coastal zone management . #% The Liberal Group , however , is disappointed with the sluggish and begrudging progress to date on a number of the liberalization dossiers , especially in telecommunications and postal services . #% It has been a very difficult task and , excuse the pun , a difficult road for him to travel down . #% In this regard , would the Commissioner agree that access by women to the workplace -- which is greatly restricted in the EU compared to the situation in the US , in part because of the lack of affordable childcare facilities -- needs to be addressed ? #% It is clear that to date there has been significant over-fishing and in many cases illegal fishing of EU waters . #% The European Union is doing its part . #% Madam President , I am hoping that East Timor will be top of Ireland 's agenda on foreign policy during the Irish presidency . #% A Zambian Government official described to me the difficulty Zambia has in retaining doctors . #% Finally , the issue of low-level presence will always be with us , and , while speedy functioning of the authorisation system will improve the situation , we still need a technical solution . #% Given the implacable divisions within the Council on this final issue of stricter national measures for certain Member States , a third reading in conciliation was inevitable . #% That has now changed , and the common position now includes a breakdown of funding by programme and , in some cases , within programmes . #% Mr President , I just wish to say that there is very little point in spending time debating and adopting environmental legislation if it is not going to be implemented . #% The directive should explicitly propose a system of support and advantages for the small and medium-sized companies in decentralised production and distribution of renewable energies . #% This Parliament has repeatedly voiced its opposition to human cloning . #% I want to thank Mr Parish for his contribution , the thorough research and the very extensive report he has produced . #% Nonetheless , there is a need for the Commission to acknowledge in its proposals , as is the case in the communication , and I quote ` that Member States must have a margin of manoeuvre to pursue regional policy goals specific to their situations in addition to areas designated jointly for purposes of Community and regional policy . #% By promoting higher safety standards and better pay , the EU is helping improve workers ' lives . #% I believe it is a sensible and understandable oral amendment . #% And I would suggest that the EU should only import food produced under the standards it demands of its own producers , and not accept lower standards in relation to animal welfare , food safety and the environment . #% Mr President I want to put on record one part of the United Kingdom that has been seriously wronged in all of this awful mess that we are in , and that is Northern Ireland . #% The Laeken summit last weekend had to address a whole series of wide-ranging political issues . #% They found that it did not affect the health of animals and that it was a natural product that did not affect the health of human beings . #% I think it is very good for your region . #% We need , as the phrase goes , research by women , for women - so that the gender implications of the research we undertake are examined - and about women . #% Nevertheless , they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty . #% Answering Mr Imbeni , he correctly acknowledged and saluted the adjustment efforts made in Italy . #% However , as long as the OIE has concerns about exporting such animals for the food chain , we have to get in line . #% They can not understand why Europe is not more present in the United Nations . #% We can not say that if we manage our own coasts , that is sufficient . #% You will recall that fisheries control is the responsibility of the Member States , not the Commission . #% We have received assurances by the Turkish authorities of their intention to pursue the process of constitutional and legislative reform . #% The kind of Europe the Nice Treaty proposes is far more detrimental to the eastern European countries , because it divides Europe . #% Everybody should be entitled to equal rights . #% We need to be more market oriented to simplify the burden of regulation and also benefit from the WTO talks . #% 
It is , in my view , right for the United States and the rest of the Western world to seek to destroy Al-Qaida and eliminate Osama Bin Laden , but so far they have failed . #% We need to do something here . #% No other Member State is at such a disadvantage . #% In conclusion , it is very important that we reiterate the message that the war against terrorism is not a battle against Islam . #% The authors ' names must be on every impact assessment , so that we know where they come from and whether we believe vested interests are involved . #% My group , through this House , will work with other parliamentarians and with the Commission to try to convince the incoming Portuguese Presidency to be more ambitious in the reform , all the while respecting the timetable . #% The construction company that dealt with it is still waiting for quite a considerable amount of money , and since it is a small construction company from Northern Ireland , the long delay in payment is also causing problems there . #% That is an appalling message to give to the people of Ireland , who had to vote twice on the Nice Treaty . #% This is but a first step forward towards transparent relations between European institutions and lobbyists . #% It relegates national parliaments to mere consultative sounding boards ; it trades meaningful democracy for the pseudo-democracy of this House ; it neuters the last defence of the nation-state by increasingly supplanting the national veto with radically increased qualified majority voting ; and it provides an unbridled path to further integration by permitting amendment by heads of government rather than by the people . #% But it is not all good . #% Therefore maintaining people in rural areas and in peripheral areas of the European Union is a better way of encouraging more tourism to those areas . #% With regard to the regulation on addition of vitamins and minerals and the so-called ` certain other substances ' to food , I feel very strongly that mass medication of the population at large , through the addition of substances to publicly supplied basic necessities such as drinking water , is ethically questionable and should not be permitted , particularly if it can not be scientifically proven that the health of sensitive groups within the population is not adversely affected by such an addition . #% As far as I am concerned Mr Chirac got all he deserved here . #% Drug cartels in Colombia and Afghanistan are in contact . #% The Irish Constitution does indeed ban abortion , but it provides for exceptions . #% If that opinion was that , in some way , a ` one size fits all ' approach to the social model is required , then that opinion is wrong . #% First of all , what further guarantees have the American authorities given with regard to how the data will be used ? #% This does nothing to redress the issue . #% Farmers who are , in the main , the custodians and managers of the landscape are responding in a positive manner by conforming with changing environmental guidelines , many of which have a cost factor for which they deserve to be compensated . #% No way can you have those who perpetrate the crime being given equal treatment with the victim . #% The Greens fully support the EU 's decision to withdraw trade preferences for Burma on both industrial and agricultural goods , but more action needs to be taken . #% Some of these are extremely problematic sites . #% The additional resources include an increase in the monthly assistance allowance available to MEPs to support their increased legislative role under the Lisbon Treaty . #% We feel a thorough examination of each asylum demand and a decision should be based on each individual case . #% We must work now towards achieving this objective via the structures of the United Nations . #% Mr President , Burundi has been plagued by violence and tension between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority for many years . #% The draft treaty is marked by both ambition and realism and is a credit to its main author , Mr Noel Dorr . #% Mr President , I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism . #% I do believe that the European Social Fund has played a key role in this regard in the past and must continue to do so . #% I would hope that the Commissioner present today will fight the case for consumers and for citizens who want to see the whole waste disposal and landfill issue dealt with in an environmentally friendly way . #% Mr President , I do not blame other European governments for ignoring the decision of the Irish people . #% This report will be submitted at a later date under a legal basis that is clear . #% Finally , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her willingness to compromise , and the Irish presidency for its determination in forcing all parties to come to agreement . #% Mr President , I too am amazed that Commissioner Monti , having had time to reflect on the discussions we had earlier this week at Question Time and having heard the strong feelings that the majority of the House - we , the messengers of the people - have on this issue , is not prepared to relent , even at this very late stage , and give us a more positive response . #% Mr President , I have been provoked by several speakers but I will not be deterred from what I have to say . #% In each country there are balance of payments difficulties , but quite encouraging growth figures in all three . #% The EU Member States must not falter when it comes to fulfilling their commitments in the framework of the European Consensus on Development . #% If we really want to exercise influence on the world stage , then EU leaders must agree on merging the functions of the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Relations , served by a single administration , adequately resourced , and using all our instruments in the policy areas - such as trade , development , environment , justice and home affairs - to support clear political objectives at the heart of our foreign policy . #% I wish to give just one example of this . #% First there is the universal service aspect - the universal obligation that my colleague Malcolm Harbour was talking about . #% I would also like to see the inclusion of the Erasmus Mundus programme in the Integrated Programme as of 2009 , when the present programme has run to the end . #% But I have to say that ultimately , it will be the consumer who will pay because , if all the farmers stop producing , you are going to have to import this food from abroad , with all the problems this entails . #% Mr President , they say it is better to give a fishing rod than a fish . #% in writing . - Today 's vote on human trafficking comes at a crucial juncture in the ongoing fight against this form of modern-day slavery . #% Deprived communities , poor children and elderly people are amongst the most vulnerable to climate change health risks . #% Directive 81/851 and Council Regulation No 2377/90 are however still to be amended to allow such use . #% Over one half of the threat to the climate disappears if you use energy in a way that saves money - if , for example , your household appliances are efficient . #% the wearing of religious symbols at school . #% Mr President , one quarter of the Irish GDP is tied up in construction . #% I would therefore call for the regulation governing the new financial perspective from 2007 to expressly require Member States to demonstrate that true additionality is delivered to the regions in whose name funding is claimed from Europe . #% Agents will still find a way of getting round that . #% We must highlight the areas where the degree of public risk warrants a prior check on qualifications for the first provision of services . #% I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets . #% The people working on the site and living in the surrounding areas have paid a very heavy price for faulty design , very poor maintenance and a very risky working environment . #% The will of the Irish people must be respected . #% These people want to ensure that they can continue in their role as fishermen feeding all the peoples of Europe and maintain strong , rural coastal communities . #% Yet in spite of the smallness of the budget that we spend there are , generally , quite a number of voices talking about reducing spending . #% The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate frauds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets . #% I would like to use the opportunity of this debate to slightly broaden the focus , because also this week we had the important news that on 10 November next we will have the accession Conference , which is an integral part of the general Conference reported today , and marks an important psychological and political threshold . #% Only time will tell if they will be successful . #% I know some colleagues are attached to this proposal , but it would be hard to defend it at world trade level because of this insignificant extra environmental benefit and because of this it could be perceived as a technical trade barrier . #% The fact that the FAO estimates that , on a global basis , one tonne of fish is thrown away for every three tonnes that is kept shows that this is a very serious problem . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply . #% I hope you will be tough too on core labour standards . #% We have great expectations of this presidency and we will be keeping a very steady eye on what is happening and on progress . #% 
It has to be the interests of all those people that attended the Commission hearing . #% I urge the Bulgarian authorities to restore our faith in their criminal justice system . #% I firmly believe that the Irish Government is in breach of European Union standards in relation to transparency in complying with humanitarian law , and the minimum standards that we have set down . #% It should be continued . #% The follow-up to the Commission 's Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010 must take into consideration the long-term consequences of the economic crisis and climate change in a society that is getting older and ethnically more diverse . #% I welcome higher standards , but I want the same everywhere . #% You ask what more we can do . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , since we are on the subject of milk quotas , I want to bring a serious situation to the Commissioner 's attention . #% Mr President , as Mr Wolf rightly pointed out , it is a question of the EU 's credibility in tackling unemployment and it is a fact that the EU overall has an appalling record on job creation . #% We must remember this and similar cases and the plight of all women under Sharia law in the African continent . #% Despite all the difficulties , what has actually been achieved in both those countries in the last 12 to 13 years is phenomenal : the change of culture , the change of attitude , the willingness to engage , the openness and transparency . #% In the build-up to the summit , advocates for freedom of expression and association in Tunisia experienced increased harassment . #% In my view , despite the many criticisms , the vision of Europe 's founding fathers continues to be realised . #% None of our countries can claim to be free of these threats . #% Mr President , this happens month after month . #% Member States have had sufficient warnings . #% Are we seriously asking the candidate countries to ratify the Accession Treaty by referenda next year only to ask them a year later to ratify another EU treaty on more changes to the day-to-day operation of the Union ? #% Remarkably , no VAT is levied on most financial services . #% I hope that the Irish people will once again give a strong endorsement for my country 's continued participation in the European Union as they have done on each of the three previous occasions when a European referendum has been held in Ireland . #% How difficult can it be for them to try to redo the French and German studies ? #% He talks about cooperation and the WEU , but we want that cooperation to extend to the neutral and non-nuclear states of this Union . #% Let us make it known that the EU programme against social exclusion can be matched by the crime prevention strategy . #% This Parliament has matured in recent months and we have learned one basic lesson for the years ahead : we are no longer the junior partner in the European political institutions . #% However , when the role of the entrepreneur or business in creating jobs is taken away , then the reality of the employment-creation quandary is undermined . #% The rapporteur has shown great tenacity in steering a very difficult course between many different viewpoints , and has arrived the best possible solution . #% Children have become invisible in EU policy . #% We want to help the Chinese to preserve Tibet , which has a unique cultural , religious and linguistic heritage . #% Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly , we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis . #% If we look at what we are discussing here , the problems we have in the Union today , the rise of the Right or whatever it may be , the slowness of economic growth , the unemployment which we have in parts of the European Union , we find that these are not serious problems at all . #% I believe this regulation certainly helps to put flesh on the bones of Aarhus . #% We all know that the beef sector has come through a very difficult period , but many serious problems remain for farmers . #% In this document there are significant clauses interpreting the mutual relationship between our institutions that also constitute significant progress . #% He mentioned the black grouse and the Iberian lynx . #% They use it for bribery , corruption and the free flow of drugs and laundered money throughout the Community . #% I thank the President-in-Office for her reply . #% Madam President , the war in Afghanistan is clearly now producing military dividends , as has been seen in the past 48 hours in the extraordinary scale and speed of the collapse of the Taliban , although they still remain potentially very powerful in large parts of the country and the terrorists they have been succouring remain hidden from view . #% Fundamental research is essential , but equally we must facilitate the application of research and development in European businesses and foster innovation . #% If you , at the beginning of your presidency , are going to behave towards Hedy d'Ancona , a distinguished parliamentarian for many years , and the other Members of the European Parliament in this fashion , it seems to me that your presidency will fail almost instantly . #% The biggest scandal surrounding this tragedy was the British decision rightly to ban the use of contaminated meat and bonemeal in the UK but , at the same time , allow and even increase the volume of infected feed which was exported to other Member States , with disastrous consequences for innocent farmers including specifically in my own country , Ireland . #% UNICEF justifiably earned the respect of countries and agencies everywhere for its programmes of oral rehydration , breastfeeding promotion , and primary education . #% We have too many flags as far as I am concerned . #% We should not forget that Al Capone was eventually imprisoned for tax evasion . #% How decisions are made is all-important . #% I have to say , however , that progress seems to have considerably slowed down since then . #% Irish farmers are already struggling to survive in an economic climate that has been made artificially difficult . #% If agreement is reached for a new European Treaty then we will have to focus on the campaign to ratify the terms of this new Treaty across the 25 different Member States of the Union . #% Water transport is the poor transport relation . #% So the problems are first-hand and they are all-pervasive . #% For some of us , that is closer than for others . #% It deserves the protection against risks proposed by the rapporteur in this report . #% The fight against this trade , if it is to be effective , must also be sophisticated and international in scope . #% In the lead-in to decimalization the importance of establishing a high degree of consumer confidence was perhaps not fully understood . #% I would like to repeat the call made by the presidency on 6 January asking for a public investigation into alleged electoral irregularities . #% I found that it carries out its duties in an open , conscientious and entirely appropriate manner . #% Agreement on the rules under which the new agreement will be concluded is due by the end of March this year , and agreement on the new round itself by the beginning of 2005 . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , Famagusta is being held hostage . #% Finally , on the matter of consumer confidence , I am very wary of the notion in the report that the Commission should promote consumer confidence in aquaculture . #% While I agree with the emphasis on prevention targets and not only on the new recycling and reuse targets , I feel strongly that national authorities in each Member State should be free to optimise their own mix of recovery and recycling options . #% Would that they could , but let us be honest with them . #% I would assure her that the presidency will be very supportive of the line taken by her . #% It is just not acceptable . #% Nevertheless we welcome the improvements that have been made to this agreement in order to conserve fish in the area and move from a 2-mile limit , which we never should have allowed , to a 12-mile limit . #% We have an opportunity to get it right . #% UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has correctly described that invasion as an illegal act contravening the UN Charter . #% I told you in July that in the United States they have on record the National Institute for Missing and Exploited Children over 367 , 000 children . #% It is important that we continue to maintain a high level of dialogue at summit and ministerial level to address critical issues facing the European Community . #% 
The European Commission and European Parliament certainly want all Member States to take advantage of the cleaner new technologies which are coming on-stream to deal with the problem of waste management . #% In the past , and in particular in the north-west of the Community , there has been deep suspicion in the fishing industry about how fishing policy was conducted and managed and a deep lack of trust . #% He is right as well to say that a concerted assessment of needs has to be made and that we have to take a more user-friendly approach when delivering information and practical support for the operations of EEIGs . #% In Ireland alone , tourism revenue in 2004 amounted to EUR 5 billion and it accounted for 3.9 % of GNP . #% I thank Mr Provan for his report , which is a fair representation of the almost unanimous opinion of the Fisheries Committee . #% It is high time that the international rules governing marine discharges were incorporated into EU legislation and , equally importantly , that such rules were enforced . #% There was quite a lot of contention at earlier readings on this directive as to whether all donations had to be voluntary or unremunerated . #% If we are serious about supervising landing and if Member States cooperate , then tonnage reduction could actually be on a voluntary basis with compensation . #% We would have hoped that as this millennium ends we would have left the spectre of war in Europe behind us . #% There are some areas that people , particularly in business , are well-familiar with , such as the single market . #% In particular , I would ask not just the Commission but the Council to be involved here and to ensure that the suppliers of education , particularly to schools , allow free access . #% However , we should be opposed to a harmonised and uniform system across the Union . #% Stronger and more vigorous species , better known colloquially as ` weeds ' - even though they are all wild flowers - gained a foothold in the colony and began to choke off the cotton-weed once human intervention was gone . #% However , on balance I believe it to be a good starting point for a comprehensive debate on the issue and shows that the Committee can work together . #% Riyadh had an 82 % turnout of men only , even though the Saudi Arabian electoral law states that citizens are eligible to vote . #% To interfere with this for political reasons would be an appalling start to this major irreversible strategic project . #% The promotion of cosmetic surgery in general is a major problem . #% Politically , we have the full support of our Conference of Presidents , which decided on two different occasions - most recently earlier this month - that in all dossiers negotiators should insist on the application of the delegated acts procedure for decisions concerning objectives , the choice of priorities , expected results and financial allocations in broad terms . #% Jean Monnet , a much respected founding father of the European Union , campaigned for the establishment of the European Economic Community because it would be a means to ensure that the continent of Europe would be at peace with itself , as opposed to engaging in war . #% I know that the euro currency has experienced some trading problems at times during this year . #% May your affection and obvious love of this Parliament , of these European institutions prove to be infectious as you address gatherings throughout your term in office . #% This funding must be allocated in an even-handed manner . #% As other countries are moving away from incineration , I believe that we in the European Union need to look very carefully at the way we are moving in this particular area . #% Also , the EU prohibits trade in its own wild birds under the Birds and Habitats directives . #% This will require an even-handed capacity to deal with all the regional political powers . #% I would have agreed with the US and would rather have seen a two-thirds majority for that purpose . #% This is clearly , therefore , the structure we should use in addressing global problems such as poverty . #% On the one hand we have the Commission 's explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea . #% I believe that it will not be acceptable to this Parliament , or to the people of Europe , for deals to be done , behind closed doors , which seriously damage the coherence , the values , the objectives and the capacity to act that the current text provides . #% I think there has been a will on the part of Ministers and , more than that , a will on the part of the Heads of State and Government to make real progress . #% Mr Martin also accused me of some 32 problem cases of claiming the daily allowance . #% It is essential that the Commission does its utmost to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU comply with international norms on workers ' rights and environmental standards . #% Mr President , we need to be clear about what we are trying to achieve in this directive . #% We must involve the countries that suffer from those scourges in the research . #% Our overseas markets are seriously threatened and we have only one case of it . #% There is sure to be another outbreak of an exotic disease - if not foot and mouth - with the movement of people and animals and modern travel today . #% How we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility . #% Indeed , most MEPs in this House come to this House with an embarrassingly low mandate . #% We would like a statement from the Commission on this now , regardless of what this Chamber decides on and whether or not we have a debate . #% I welcome the attempts , in very difficult circumstances , by both governments to restore the peace process . #% Mr President , another year , another report , but what real change ? #% The proposals which do not provide for full compensation would have devastating effects on the Irish beef sector . #% Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to the worsening situation in Darfur . #% What is important is that the EU directs funding for research across Member States to ensure we have a full and accurate picture of the scope of the problem . #% Taking into account the fact that we have appointed a committee , a sub-committee or an ad hoc committee to deal with this matter , I think it is very wrong that the outgoing President and Bureau should have their arms tied now and into the future as regards this most important subject . #% It is another example of rural development in action -- and it does work . #% In Brazil this year , for example , while hurricanes thousands of miles away battered the United States and the Caribbean with water and wind , residents of a small fishing town deep in the Amazon region watched the lake on which they depend for food and transportation shrivel away in a year which saw the region 's worst drought in four decades : the result of warmer ocean water , which has also been blamed for one of the most violent hurricane seasons on record in the Gulf of Mexico . #% Undoubtedly Europe has the resources to sustain our high living standards , but we need to take action to unlock them . #% It has already completed 22 of its 31 chapters of accession to the European Union . #% The spectacular rise in the volume of financial transactions in the global economy within the last decade , which , in 2007 , reached a level 73.5 times higher than nominal world GDP , illustrates the growing disconnection between financial transactions and the needs of the real economy . #% I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states in which the family and marriage is protected . #% I compliment Mr Cornelissen on his excellent report . #% The message is obvious : consumers are happy to support Fair Trade . #% But trading permits seem to work . #% That is the only way we are going to get any change . #% That is the road the presidency intends to continue going down . #% There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government 's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September . #% I support the adoption of a code of conduct and the establishment of a European monitoring platform . #% It is equally important to bear in mind that there can not be economic development in a modern economy without a strong social dimension . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his resolve . #% We should call for freedom of expression and assembly and international solidarity with workers in China to fight this horrific bureaucratic regime , many of whose members aspire to be oligarchs , obviously , as they did previously with the same system in Russia . #% I have to say here today that we must also stop blaming workers , workers who are now under sentence of death for the illegal and criminal activities of the nuclear industry . #% On the question of the so-called golden rule on investment , we can support references to Article 104 ( c ) in the relevant paragraphs within the multilateral surveillance proposition . #% As I said , we who come from Ireland know the benefits that can accrue for the people of the Middle East if courage and leadership are shown by the people there . #% I am disappointed that my amendment to extend the thirty-mile exclusive zone has not been accepted . #% If the report goes through plenary as it is , the Verts/ALE Group will have to vote against it . #% 
I did a report on it myself some years ago . #% In the case of Greece and of both parts of the island of Ireland there are obvious geographical obstacles to full participation in a single rail market . #% On this occasion , I think we have got to move , and I want the Commission to give us an assurance that bureaucracy will not hold us back . #% We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can . #% I particularly support the principles contained in the report concerning access for all regardless of income or wealth , high quality of care , and financial sustainability of care systems . #% So for all these reasons it is important to guarantee that we control the supervisory measures over nuclear materials . #% We must identify the experts in injury reporting and work with them to get the information that can be studied to truly prevent injuries and promote safety . #% It is most important that we enthuse our peoples and - top of your agenda - enthuse the Irish people for the enlargement project which we all support . #% Mr President , thank you for giving me this opportunity to raise a matter with you . #% For these and other reasons I felt it inappropriate to participate in the vote . #% It is not in the interests of the European Union to bring in legislation that will put people at a disadvantage and make the European Union look like kill-joys . #% While not detracting from the seriousness of the situation , the impact on consumer confidence has been far greater in my view than the actual threat to public health . #% If the Convention drafts such a constitution without the Charter it will , in my view , be a disgrace . #% The European Council is going to ask the European Commission to develop a broader communications strategy . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to the Italian presidency , Mr Dini , and to the Commission President , Mr Santer , for their valuable contributions to this debate here this morning . #% Further economic stagnation of European markets should be avoided . #% If I could repeat , the Council does not have any proposals from the Commission and the honourable Member may well obtain more detailed information on the up-to-date position if she places a question to the Commission . #% Now , with Pat Cox as our President , we must confront it from day one . #% The European Union is not simply about mutual economic progress . #% In the face of genuine asylum-seeking , this is not good enough . #% It is not too late to put together a restructuring package for the industry . #% We must be concerned about the human problems that arise out of the squeeze-out of excessive labour , but at the same time , we should remember that the cost of food has been reduced . #% I also feel that the Commission was most wise to avoid reference to nuclear power in its own proposals and I would advise you to keep to this approach because it is a most divisive thing to propose , and we will certainly not agree to it . #% This is what I want to concentrate on . #% Nowhere has this opportunity been more ignored than in the processing of wool . #% The twenty-fifth of January is a date which will be etched in the memory of the Colombian people but , regrettably , for the wrong reasons . #% In relation to the timetable , I urge the Commission to carry out further studies to ensure that the targets applicable in the EU are also right for countries at the margin , not the least the new applicant states . #% Our job is always to pursue the unattainable goal , dragging our pragmatic colleagues with us as far as possible towards this goal . #% It does not propose a specific solution to these questions as such and it does not suggest that global regulation should be introduced for the Internet or that new international entities should be created . #% The Minister intends to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases : if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years or if the quota owner has a leasing arrangement which expires in March one year and he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year . #% It is time to banish the notion that the future of climate change policy is coterminous with the Kyoto Protocol . #% The fact is that Iran has changed very little in recent times . #% Madam President , since July 1997 , the European Parliament has been a staunch defender of the autonomy of Hong Kong under the ` one-country two-systems ' policy . #% Unfortunately , those gangsters have been replaced by other younger and even more vicious criminals . #% I want to say a special thank you to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for the commitment he has shown on this issue , both as a former chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , a Vice-President of our Parliament and someone who has keenly followed these issues from the beginning of the peace process . #% Ireland will play host to the Special Olympics in 2003 , and the contribution of the EU to the organisation of this event is also worthy of praise . #% The first step is a comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen binding the international community to mandatory reductions and providing for sanctions at international level for non-compliance . #% One of the things I noticed throughout the ACP-EU partnership debate was the lack of emphasis on education . #% The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU . #% Clearly there is a lack of public consent here . #% The truth is that this disease can strike anywhere and at any time . #% As has been said by Mr Verhofstadt , there should be no taboos in our debate and the idea of federalism and a constitution for Europe could guarantee the role of the citizens in small states better than any other form of governance . #% On the issue of Taiwan , I also condemn President Jiang Zemin 's threats to use military force . #% Therefore the three amendments tabled are not necessary and I would ask colleagues not to support them . #% The statistics are rather frightening . #% The cost of the EU enlargement will be borne from within the budgetary parameters of the Berlin Agreement . #% And although no case of TSE in fish had ever been discovered , the feeding of fishmeal to ruminants was also subjected to a temporary ban . #% It is very difficult to find in this methodology which are the real priorities , where there is political passion and focus , and which are merely the issues that we have to deal with because they are part of due process . #% As we say in the resolution , it leaves domestic workers more likely to face discrimination and , indeed , multiple forms of discrimination . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner , which was quite explicit . #% In conclusion , I congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative in addressing this very timely and important question . #% I voted against amendments calling for yet more directives and proposals that would hold back industry . #% Mr President , I too want to congratulate Louise McVay and indeed the rapporteur , Mrs Aaltonen , for bringing forward this report from the Committee on Petitions . #% I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Byrne , the Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Public Health , for his absolute determination to guarantee that European Union consumers have total confidence in all food products that are sold within the Union . #% I would like to make particular reference to the unsatisfactory rate of uptake in the UK , Ireland and France . #% I was one of the 200 parliamentarians who participated in the Convention and produced the Convention text , which the IGC subsequently took on board to a very large degree . #% The rich could dig in behind their barriers , they could buy some essential things from the poorer countries but we would be back to the seventeenth century with the strong exploiting the weak . #% This directive , which will now be enacted uniformly across the European Union , will ensure that cars will be disposed of in the future in a more environmentally friendly manner . #% I suppose it is appropriate that a man of his origins should be doing that . #% Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion . #% I welcome the Commissioner 's general response and I also welcome the white paper , but I do not agree with her . #% At the time the Spanish Government was criticised for towing the stricken vessel out to sea , ignoring the advice of experts who argued that it should be taken to a sheltered bay or port where the oil could be contained . #% The Irish authorities decided to play with fire when they set out to encourage industrial development by multinational chemicals companies in Ireland without looking at the long-term consequences . #% This simply will not happen - certainly not in the wealthier parts of Europe . #% I also believe we now need a full communication on the impact of EMU on regional policies , particularly in the light of the Council 's decision on the budget , to cut structural fund payments and to create a false relationship between structural funds , deficit criteria and economic convergence . #% So rather than repeat what has been said by other speakers , I just want to mention to the Dutch presidency two points on which I would like to see some action . #% 
There is an onus on all Member States , but in particular those who have decided not to take part in EMU from the outset . #% Mr President , Mrs Wallis ' report is an important contribution to the debate on Community policy on out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes . #% I would like any policy on tourism to try and address this question , because balanced regional development has been a priority in EU policy and I have always believed that this should also be linked to tourism policy . #% The question of income for older people depends on the extent to which we retain the European social model of a contribution from people who are in work to those who , at various points in their lives , either through illness or old age , will no longer be able to take part in the workforce . #% At present , the arbitrary cut-off point of 75 % of GDP does not take account of important factors such as unemployment and peripherality . #% The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations . #% It is unbelievable that the United States is seeking to act outside international norms of law . #% I agree with Mr Maat about the provision of local abattoirs . #% Competition must not just be free : it must also be fair , and it seems to me that principle is being swept aside . #% Many people have spoken about how best we can deal with this . #% The Commission response to this , however , has been stony-faced and ideological . #% No evidence has been found which establishes that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction - the contrary in fact . #% author . - I want to ask the Commissioner if he will look at the non-direct financing aspects of the problems that SMEs are encountering . #% The present system has brought stability to the sector and enabled the Community to be a modest but regular exporter to world markets . #% Those three levels are complementary and Parliament , being the only institution directly elected by the European citizens , should strive to have a greater say in all three of them . #% In consequence it exudes imbalance to the point that it will bring comfort to terrorist and anti-democratic forces . #% If this is the outcome of our international trade agreements , I really think we have to start changing this situation and changing it quickly . #% We do not make a case here today for the large factory farms . #% Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal , as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and without proper labelling , they may buy a product containing these textiles without realising it . #% We need to employ a flexible system , and the subsidies we pay will go up and down . #% We can be assured that any report by Mr Oostlander is backed by a great sense of purpose and integrity . #% I fear that the potential consequences , should the downside of the nuclear industry become more widely evident , are probably too much for some of our Member States to bear . #% I have no difficulty with the other two . #% I ask the Commissioner , whom I have personally great faith in and in his ability to achieve things within the Commission , to press for an embargo of this kind in the region . #% There is pretty much universal agreement that this deplorable situation is due to the excess capacity of the world 's fishing fleets . #% For how could Parliament 's Committee on Budgets discharge the budget without exercising its function to scrutinise the financial management and allocation of funds ? #% The encyclopaedia came to the conclusion that mankind could never exterminate this species . #% So really we have to bring an end to European tax-payers ' money being used for the cruel and inhumane policy of live exports . #% We have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world . #% I thank all those who spent a lot of time and effort in getting to this position . #% Do not keep from Parliament information that it should rightly have in its oversight role . #% I welcome the resolution from the spring summit to appoint a counter-terrorism coordinator . #% I strongly believe that the EU must continue to play as active a role as possible in brokering a peace between both sides . #% It may be that under law they do not qualify for refugee status , but if this is so they should get it , and they should still be allowed to remain in Ireland in any case . #% It is a great honour for him and his family and , in particular , a great honour for Ireland to have a president of a group from Ireland . #% Applicant countries can now take solace from the fact that the EU has reformed its internal decision-making procedures so that the mechanics of the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% I believe in the rights of everyone , I believe in democracy . #% It has been repeated here so often that is what is needed . #% No one looks for our consent . #% I would ask you , Commissioner , because the Commission has observers there , to give us accurate information on what is happening in relation to the numbers of abandoned babies . #% From the example of last weekend , it is clear that the over-centralised EU is presently not working . #% Both sides must show their commitment to peace by acting with maximum restraint , as called for by the EU Presidency in its recent declaration . #% It happens on a regular basis and we all have an opportunity to make it very clear to the Commission in this debate that we do not accept this . #% Last year I produced a detailed policy proposal calling for the establishment of an EU coastguard , which I submitted to the European Convention for discussion . #% In particular we welcome the time limits introduced for the processing of applications which will ensure that the current backlog in many member states will be cleared and a fairer procedure brought into place . #% We should be very concerned that twice as many women as men suffer from dementia , and we should be very concerned that with an ageing European population , the number of sufferers will double in the next 20 years . #% I wish to refer briefly to Sellafield . #% The scourge of international terrorism must also be tackled head on , and I agree wholeheartedly with the views and comments expressed by the previous speakers . #% That is wrong and it shows utter contempt for the electors of Europe , not least the electors of Mr Guellec 's own country , who handsomely rejected the Constitution . #% I know that great progress has been made there . #% However , what did the Committee on Fisheries do ? #% We are back on a typical Green agenda , Mr President , the same old story : no matter what you give them they want more and more . #% But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission ? #% We want joined-up thinking , and we expect confirmation from the Commission that those measures , as important as these directives , will be part of the programme in the immediate future . #% We are all aware that the internal structures operating within the European Union must be modernised and by 1 May next we are hopefully going to be living in a Community of 25 Member States comprising a population of over 500 million people . #% We should not underestimate the seriousness of the situation . #% Secondly , CO2 technology is not suitable for use in certain extreme temperatures , in very hot climates for instance . #% That is how it came across in the interpretation . #% We need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken . #% But the essential points are that it does not take soil or climatic conditions into consideration and , most critically , that the goal of the Nitrates Directive should be defined at Community level but not the mechanism to achieve that goal . #% I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank Gérard Caudron very much for his work as well as , of course , Commissioner Busquin . #% We can not defend our values by abandoning them and I suspect that some of the people involved in today 's debate would much rather we abandoned our values just to prove themselves right . #% I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that . #% In particular , what about the undermining of confidence in the Stability Pact which that creates on the wider market ? #% I share the concerns regarding imbalances within the euro area , such as speculation in the construction sector , whose excesses contribute to asymmetric shocks , and call on the Commission to study possible mechanisms to improve the economic governance of the euro area and curb the expansion of such imbalances . #% For the record , next week the first Conference of the Parties of the Stockholm Convention on POPs or Persistent Organic Pollutants , takes place in Punta del Este in Uruguay . #% 
As it stands in our resolution , therefore , it may not make sense . #% I therefore welcome this initiative that acknowledges the international nature of environmental damage . #% The budget is clearly inadequate and has to be increased if this programme is to be properly effective . #% I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States . #% I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament . #% Again , short food miles and local branding are essential . #% If we are serious about retaining the European farm model referred to in the Santer proposals then we must provide suitable off-farm employment for both women and men . #% We must advance a positive agenda on trade matters and resolve disputes before they go to the WTO process . #% The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials , and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials , including MOX fuels . #% People should have the right to opt for a healthy approach , rather than waiting for disease to set in and then having to resort to pharmaceutical drugs , many of which have dangerous side effects . #% It is certainly the most contentious political issue . #% I co-signed this resolution on breast cancer as I believe the European Union can do much to assist Member States in this area through extensive research , benchmarking and sharing of best-practice principles , as well as offering Member States substantial professional , material and technical assistance through European programmes . #% However , Africa has more than economic problems : it has political and human rights problems . #% I think it is the first report they have done in this Parliament and , I have to say , they have done a very good job , together with staff . #% But the trap that Mr Pimenta has held up is evidence that this is a very nasty piece of work . #% The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement , to which the EU and Egypt are parties , is also relevant , as is the Barcelona Process . #% Strict depositary liability will ensure that investors can always claim damages and will be informed of the reasons for potential delegation of liability . #% I support the position that EU spending should remain as a percentage of gross domestic product and should not be stabilised at current spending levels . #% The attempt by the Council to shave EUR 275 million off market expenditure in such hard-hit sectors as arable crops , milk , beef and mutton and lamb is completely out of order under the current climate . #% . Mr President , I wish to thank President Barroso and the entire Commission for being here this morning . #% We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves . #% Mr President , I should like to express my support for the Italian Government in its efforts to conclude the EU Treaty negotiations by the Council meeting on 13 December . #% May your enthusiasm not wane for the next two-and-a-half years and may it prove to be infectious as you represent us throughout Europe and indeed further afield . #% I wish also to state that I speak this evening on behalf of Mr Niall Andrews who wanted to speak on this subject but had to return to Dublin unexpectedly . #% We want to ensure that we remain a popular location for outside investors , who view Ireland as a gateway to the single market within the European Union . #% I said earlier in response to another debate in the House on the common foreign and security policy area that I believe that we need to do much more as a region in a coordinated way to tackle this problem . #% Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue . #% My group will be supporting the report as it stands in its entirety and will not be expecting or requesting any deletions of parts of paragraphs or phrases . #% I also wish to say , as have other speakers , that , after the meeting on Monday night , I am not completely convinced by President Barroso 's position on the resources . #% A clear signal has to go out to the Indonesian authorities that we are no longer going to accept their contempt for the wish of the international community for human rights and peace . #% Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques , personnel and equipment at appropriate locations . #% Mr President , Ireland does not in general have a problem with stricter ELVs for new plants , as these can simply be incorporated into IPC licensing and will help achieve national emission ceilings . #% I agree that we do not need , as other colleagues have said , first - and second-class fishermen . #% While my constituents in Northern Ireland recognised that enlargement would bring with it a financial burden on the richer Member States , they were also keen to ensure that funding is allocated in ways that will bring sustainable improvement throughout the entire European Union . #% You can be sure that we shall be following up very carefully the sixth framework programme , visiting projects , speaking to scientists and asking for evaluations . #% The consumer has a right to know if farmed fish cause a disproportionate number of rapid alerts . #% The truth is that in the Fléchard case , Fléchard was suspected of fraud , the Irish government fined and punished them to the extent of EUR 17 million . #% Natural resources can not replenish themselves in the face of growing demand . #% We must ensure that these measures are applied in an equitable manner . #% It is good that opinion in Britain is changing in favour of the right of coastal fishermen , which I always accepted , to exploit their own resources . #% As to the IGC , it is important that the draft treaty being prepared is not based on the lowest common denominator principle . #% It is obvious from the hearings - indeed without them it is obvious - that there are major areas of overlap and therefore potential conflict in operational responsibilities within the college . #% I believe that is where Agenda 2000 proposals will take us unless we make changes without delay . #% I do not think we can believe that . #% On the Stability Pact , the Liberal Group welcomes the emphasis placed by Parliament on the need for interest on deposits and on fines which arise under this pact to be , in principle , assigned to own resources . #% In my country , where we have less than four million inhabitants , there are 2.5 million members of credit unions with savings in excess of EUR 9 billion . #% Mr Patten may bury their heroism , we will see to it that their heroism still lives . #% But the emphasis , from Parliament 's point of view , should be on having the letter of the law complied with in so far as the making of these agreements is concerned . #% This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999 . #% The company criticised in the amendments ( Raytheon ) was in fact welcomed by two Nobel Peace Prize winners ( Hume/Trimble ) . #% It is incumbent on this House to make clear to the Commission and the Council that aid needs to be provided to the European airline industry and to the aviation industry in general , so that we can maintain a European aviation industry , particularly our airlines . #% What is the situation concerning our immunity in other Member States ? #% What I am seeking is a commitment from you Mr President , as President-in-Office , to bring this before the Council at some stage in the future . #% What solid steps will the Council take to see to it that Member States meet their obligations ? #% Mr Chichester recognises the limited role Parliament can play in energy policy , given that it is essentially a Member State competence . #% With regard to funding for health , I have welcomed the modifications here and would thank Mr Caudron for his concern , because human genome research can not be the only strand of health research funded by the EU . #% I would like to commend the Greek Government for the manner in which it has overseen the running of the presidency of the European Union for the past six months . #% I would suggest the same thing should happen for taxpayers contributing to the EU 's budget . #% It should be noted that 80 % of first-time smokers in the EU are below the age of 18 . #% I find this extraordinary . #% The Greens were in a difficult position in trying not to amend it because we knew what the end result would be . #% History tells us that when human institutions become the giver of rights , rights become gifts . #% Nonetheless , there is much to be recommended in the Commission 's proposals and there is a clear way forward for harmonising criminal sanctions by means of a third-pillar instrument . #% It ought to be extremely rare for two or more cases of severe injuries to occur in a single accident . #% We need a reply . #% It is there : what is missing is the will to search and to find it . #% 
Similar possibilities apply to animals . #% The promotion of e-business activities , e-health programmes , e-government and e-learning initiatives under the auspices of the e-Europe Action Plan 2005 is being implemented in its entirety across the length and breadth of Europe . #% Everyone who has studied this dossier in great detail and who has discussed it free from polemics , but not free from their political preferences , has a view on these issues ; no one made any personal accusation or imputation against you . #% As we have seen with the most recent enlargement , it is one which continues to progress . #% We need to revisit the issue of special exemptions on reduced rates . #% The variety of regional and lesser-used languages across the continent of Europe is an integral part of our unique cultural heritage . #% This was an answer to a question I tabled on 11 October 2000 : ` the Commission , following extensive consultations with all parties concerned , concluded that detailed harmonisation of national rules in this area , over and above those that already exist , is neither desirable nor necessary and would not be justified from the point of view of subsidiarity or proportionality ' . #% Public intervention in agricultural insurance systems would lead to cherry-picking by the private sector , and the European Union could be left covering the highest or uninsurable risks , which would be very expensive and lead to considerable budgetary problems . #% If the British nuclear industry is such a model profession , why do BNFL not agree to allow the European Commission independently to evaluate its operations and the powers which derive under the EURATOM Treaty ? #% However , we need to have rules , and that is why in this report we have set out strategic guidelines to allow Member States to plan their programmes from 2007 onwards . #% It is unjustifiable in the twenty-first century that we are using such prehistoric practices . #% In recent weeks we witnessed the attempt to bring a flotilla of decrepit decommissioned US warships through EU waters . #% They should test ETA 's commitment and bona fides and realise that you should not and can not give rewards for doing that which was necessary and right . #% People can not look at the dwindling stocks and our failure to conserve them and say that the wide oceans out there present us with opportunities . #% If the intention is not honoured , the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith . #% It is perfectly legitimate to link financial incentives to human rights and democracy questions through our funding of key projects . #% I thank Mr Sacconi and all involved in this very difficult piece of legislation : a work in progress . #% As mentioned in his report , Ireland has been extremely active and successful in broadening access to hedge funds . #% Both the US and Japan are pulling out of this research completely . #% We failed , and failed miserably . #% For some time now , I have been calling for the exclusion of agriculture from these talks . #% I call on all Member States to sign , ratify or accede to the protocol as soon as possible . #% If more countries were willing to do this , then we would not have the same sense of urgency or danger that now faces many pensioners in Europe today . #% It is unfortunate that , while so many positive things happened in the latter half of the twentieth century , words such as ` ethnic cleansing ' and ` genocide ' have come into our normal vocabulary . #% I very much welcome the response of the President-in-office and I am sure he is aware of the scale of this problem . #% It is unbelievable that we can not identify exactly where they are so that we can assist them . #% My group believes that by proposing this short postponement , the Members concerned will have time to brief their groups on their visit and help produce an improved text calling for the closure of Guantánamo Bay that , hopefully , all groups can support . #% When the 8300 investors in Ireland , who were putting money aside for their pensions , and about 4000 such investors in Germany went to their respective regulators , they were told to go and talk to the UK regulator . #% . I , like other Members of the House , fully understand the desire to see closer cooperation between the judicial authorities in all the Member States . #% Support must be given to the small farmers and food producers in the regions in question . #% That is why we believe this is the wrong method to move forward and one that should be ignored . #% Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress . #% Therefore he has failed to honour and respect this House by giving a direct answer to a direct question . #% However we are not divided on our concern for human rights and democracy , and the resolution before the House was supported unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs . #% The big difficulty is , as always , the trust of the fishermen . #% Could I say before I sit down on an entirely different matter , but one related to the work of the Commission , that I would appeal to the Commissioner to ask our colleagues in the Commission to take steps to relax the rules and regulations governing state aid for the aviation industry , otherwise we are going to have to deal with tens of thousands of workers right across Europe who could well be unemployed in the not too distant future . #% The deluge in neighbouring Kilkenny is the worst in 60 years ! #% Just last week I presented certificates to mature students in Tullamore , a town in the midlands of Ireland . #% Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate Mr Cashman . #% Mr President , the European Parliament today has voted on legislation that will slow down the rate of technological advance , narrow consumer choice , increase the price of software and destroy the free and open-source software industry in Europe . #% I was informed yesterday by the questions office of this House that my question relating to the Middle East would not be taken by the Council today because the matter I was raising , the Association Agreement between Europe and Israel , would be dealt with by the Council in debate yesterday . #% However , it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise . #% On the one side there is the prospect of slipping into violence - a renewed violence , but without hope ; or alternatively , a renewed commitment to redoubling efforts to engage once and for all , and perhaps for the first time , in a genuine and meaningful political dialogue . #% We have a very good line-up of hard working Commissioners tonight . #% It is essential that a common code of conduct applies in all our institutions , so that citizens are not baffled or bamboozled by the response of our institutions to their problems and complaints . #% The idea of setting up a case book and collecting evidence is an excellent idea . #% Could he indicate whether this will continue , with additional collective responsibility , into the future ? #% We must create an EU that complements the role of the Member State , not one that undermines it . #% It has also favoured terrorist prisoner groups over victim groups , who exist as victims because of the horror visited upon them by those terrorists . #% I appeal to the Council , therefore , to make the new formula work so that we can have a common , strong , unified human rights report , representing a European view on human rights , that we can send to all corners of the world . #% Indeed , at present , some Ulster fishermen are awaiting trial in Liverpool Crown Court . #% We must also insist on periodic scientific reviews . #% From an Irish perspective I welcome the recent initiative by the Irish Government which seeks to make Ireland the centre of electronic commerce in Europe in the very near future . #% Further to what the Commissioner has said , is the Commission aware that several PVC toys have already been taken off the market in Spain , Sweden and Italy ? #% We must therefore coordinate these . #% Mr Gallagher has the same qualifications as he comes from the same sort of region and has the same sort of experience of the fishing industry . #% Tomorrow 's vote is an historic one , though we call many votes historic in this Parliament . #% They are also essential for the preservation of cultural traditions and practices , which must be preserved . #% Likewise , who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first implemented that the number of long-term unemployed would still continue to be the same five years later ? #% That is why many of us went to Iraq . #% There is an absolute necessity to lock the two together . #% Public opinion in Europe was clearly divided over the question of invading Iraq . #% The enlargement process provides the basis for a truly historic reconciliation on a continent which has been divided over the past century by wars and ideologies . #% I wish you every success and I am extremely glad that we have had an opportunity to raise the issue within this House because there is widespread support for it . #% The Bureau was set up some years ago on an initiative of the Irish government and is still co-financed by the Irish government . #% Of course we must try to break into the lucrative American market , but first of all let us make sure that we produce programmes that will sell across our own borders , that people will be interested in and will buy , and thus add more to the pot for independent producers . #% 
If that focus has helped to improve -- as I believe it has -- the plight of these people , then it will all have been worthwhile , even if it has upset the authorities . #% These regions , which had so much invested in the Moroccan agreement , must be offered real alternatives as quickly as possible . #% We must also assist in promoting marketing structures to cooperatives to enable small enterprises to compete and successfully market their products . #% That would make it much easier , because otherwise it is easy for people to see how each Member voted . #% This Parliament must exercise the most stringent controls in that area . #% In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000 . #% Third is the question of our commitments to Kyoto and to a clean fuel technology , using wind , water , air and solar energy . #% I have known her for many years . #% I will check that but can I ask ( and I do not expect you to give a formal answer ) whether - maybe when it does come before the Council - the Luxembourg Government will support such a proposal and whether maybe it is something , as you go out of your presidency , that you will pressurize the next presidency about ? #% The fact is that you have accepted a ban on the substance we are speaking about for certain objects , for example teething rings . #% I am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked Member States to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the EU 2020 strategy . #% Certainly the current rules benefit car manufacturers and dealers and disadvantage consumers . #% Farming needs to be made an attractive career prospect and if we are to bring young qualified people into the profession , a failure to do so will lead to further depopulation of rural areas to the point where certain rural communities will no longer be sustainable . #% The current system has successful elements but it also contains flaws : surely it can not be right that the outdated , 13-year-old European Standard EN1384 ( Helmets for Equestrian Activities ) is still in use today despite concerns before its publication and 2 subsequent upgrade mandates from the Commission . #% He will know the critical tone of Parliament 's resolution on the broad guidelines last month . #% So let us have the study and then we can take the necessary decisions on this issue . #% The other , and more real , concern is that in an effort to achieve stability and an end to violence , strict and fundamentalist Islamic law will be enforced on large populations . #% However , we must not erode the credibility of the Convention by supporting scientifically weak proposals on this . #% I believe that the entire island of Ireland can only benefit from the developments of the last few days . #% I urge all fans attending the World Cup to be alert to this scandal and to report any suspicions of trafficking that they might have . #% I believe that NATO has basically ignored international law in the action it has taken and that proper efforts were not made to find a peaceful solution . #% It comprises three funds , for Nature , Environment and Third Countries . #% Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development , combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes . #% We have also requested that dual-use technology with a potential military application be excluded from this agreement . #% The energy/intensity use in most of the European Union is worsening . #% This must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of ` trade secrecy ' . #% Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it would tackle the real concerns of those we represent . #% I would refer you also to the fact - I have said this in other fora - that Director-General Lamoureux has made statements on nuclear energy which vastly exceed the brief of the Commission . #% Rather than take up Parliament 's time explaining how successful my party has been in government in creating employment and protecting workers ' rights , I would like to invite him to discuss its merits and demerits over a drink . #% As is indicated in our question , the committee certainly believes that the online problem-solving network can find pragmatic and rapid solutions , which do not have to end up in the courts or as infringement cases . #% I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission 's work programme for 2000 . #% However , the opportunity is there to be seized and we have to ask whether we can get things right this time . #% - The proposal for this directive deals with situations in which a traffic accident occurs in the country of residence of the person causing the accident or in a third country . #% It is a separate question . #% We have a right to ask questions and demand answers from the US authorities . #% Fish are migratory : they do not stay in one place all the time , year after year . #% Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work . #% We are dealing with viable , solvent democracies and while we have to note that the age profile has become lower - the debt is not as old as it used to be - nevertheless , there is no good reason why EUR 2.2 billion should be outstanding . #% A very important part of my question concerns the continuity of LEADER . #% It is intolerable that residents of parts of Valencia face the fact that their property has been and may be expropriated by the local state with the consequent enrichment of developers . #% We must commit ourselves not just to the concept of equality of opportunity , but equally and crucially to the attainment of equality of outcome . #% Member States need to stand up and take responsibility for their respective infrastructures . #% I hope that the peace and stability and the resulting prosperity which we have enjoyed in the second half of this century will continue as a result . #% It highlights the importance of EU cohesion policy as a means of alleviating disparities in regions that are lagging behind . #% In general the EU has made a very positive contribution to establishing gender equality right across a range of areas . #% They will give us the type of debate that will mean we can put away all the documents we read diligently and carefully on technical matters that we should not be debating at all . #% Policy Coherence for Development can not be sidelined when negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements , and has a key role to play if we are to ensure that the outcome of the Doha Round is not detrimental to development . #% Benefits will flow from that . #% There is no justification or room for equivocation . #% I believe that a balanced view of the decline of the bee population must be taken into consideration , not just blaming farming practices but investing in investigation into diseases and ways of minimising their impact . #% The Delors package has not been so long in existence . #% As you know , the Commission published a White Paper on the issue , recommending that a framework directive be put in place to cover services of general interest . #% It is important , however , that the needs of developing countries are taken into account and that our response is proportionate and that we allow controlled exemptions . #% According to this report `` the trend towards tax rate competition may lead to a drop in income tax '' . #% The nationalities of Europe are not changed , they are the creation of God . #% It is important that legislators listen to all sides and get the balance right , guided by the unassailable principle of safe food for our citizens . #% I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally . #% The European Year must be about much more than raising awareness simply about discrimination . #% Mr President , the cavalier attitude the Israeli authorities display towards their obligations to comply with international law with regard to their trade relations with European Union is an indicative example of its attitude to international law in general . #% There are provisions in the Nice Treaty meaning that once these countries are full Member States of the EU , they can be sanctioned . #% Mr President , if you watch the language groups that are participating in this debate you will see that there is a lot of pressure in the north-west of the Community on the fishing industry and deep concern , which is reflected here . #% Commissioner Solbes Mira 's reprimand angered middle Ireland and raised fears of Europe meddling in our tax affairs . #% I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the win by his home team in football today . #% Thank you , Commissioner , for your very direct and clear answer . #% I hope there will be majority support for his nomination in the House tomorrow , and I am delighted that our group will be fully endorsing and supporting his nomination for Commission President . #% Mr President , you have anticipated the point of order I wished to make . #% 
In conclusion , I would like to assure the Commissioner that he has the full support of Parliament in this important area of food safety . #% That possibility is still there and we should do everything we can to put aside our relatively petty differences , based on national egotism in many cases , to reach a common position for Europe . #% Now we have to start biting some bullets ; we have to start focusing on the issues . #% The traditional roles of women in childcare and care for the elderly are all part of this wider debate and it is not possible to do justice to the subject in two minutes . #% We have seen the damage that can be wreaked from a more lax approach . #% Madam President , I shall start with the Kauppi report -- and I join in the congratulations to Mrs Kauppi on the birth of her son this week . #% Animal welfare was perceived by poor countries as a rich person 's interest which , to some of them , was almost obscene where we are confronted with starving people . #% The EU 2005 programme must be fully implemented so as to increase broadband access to schools and libraries and ensure that all our young people are guaranteed access to high-speed Internet services and development skills . #% There are reports of headaches , sleep disruption and a number of other effects , which are not referred to by the Commission . #% Unfortunately there is another element , the witness protection scheme . #% We have a chance to get it right for the developing world and the EU sugar industry , but the current proposals are not the solution to this dilemma . #% These people do not want this life ; they want peace and safety for their families and a chance to live their lives . #% I welcome the pioneering decision to introduce a phased ban on fluorinated gases with a global warming potential of more than 150 times the potency of carbon dioxide in motor vehicles . #% While Northern Ireland may be a very small place compared to other European areas , we need and require railways in Northern Ireland as well . #% Now the Commission has published its guidelines for 2002 , all Member States , including Ireland , should openly negotiate its position , make it clear to the public at home what their position is , so that when the time comes and budgets are being implemented based around those guidelines , the public knows exactly why that is being done . #% There are now elements of both legal and political certainty with regard to the enlargement negotiations . #% However , the most extraordinary thing in this report is the reference to the market and the creation and availability of new financial resources and the rationality of European stock markets . #% My biggest fear arising from the failure of the Hampton Court summit and a lacklustre British Presidency is that it will make my government over-eager to secure a face-saving deal on the budget in December and that , as a result , Mr Blair will concede far too much on the British rebate , just so it can be said that something was achieved by the British Presidency -- that is to say something other than ensuring EU bankruptcy by opening the door to Turkish accession . #% Mr President , the job Parliament has here today is quite simple : to adopt or reject the compromise achieved in conciliation . #% Mr President , the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a major threat to the world . #% For example , our Foreign Minister said that he was quite happy with the decisions taken : he said that the interests of neutral countries were taken on board and that they were met within the opinion which was submitted by the EU Political Committee . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his very comprehensive reply . #% The conclusions of the Göteborg Summit of EU leaders with regard to the enlargement negotiations and the accession process stated that the road map should make it possible for those countries that are ready to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 . #% Given that a five-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer 's means 50 % less prevalence rates , I welcome the focus on prevention and early detection by the Commission . #% Ireland has the biggest coastal area in the European Community . #% That is the road to anarchy ; a road which will give no security for any state on the face of this earth - least of all the small state which I represent here in this Parliament . #% Thank you for the progress on consultation you have made to date . #% It is clear that a voluntary approach to guarantee rights for people with disabilities is not working . #% We have to retain the capacity to invest and support in our marginalised groups and communities which are not necessarily in Objective I or Objective II areas . #% Without the cooperation of all the members of the Employment Committee , we could not have arrived at the unanimous decision that underpinned the amendments that are going forward to the Council . #% Legislative instruments are called for when negotiations are not concluded in relation to training , lifelong learning , organisation of work , adjustments , new forms of work , guidelines for negotiations by social partners and supplementary sickness insurance . #% The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States . #% The Irish had always voted ` Yes ' to Europe , so this time they thought it would be the same . #% There is no border to prevent our contact and cooperation . #% Mr President , today in this House we have an illustration of the deficiency in the current procedures , with a motion of censure being necessary to try to extract information sufficient to meet suspicions about potential conflicts of interest . #% Mr President , who can forget the tragic images of Burundi , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , Bosnia-Herzegovina and more recently , Kosovo that are still fresh in our minds . #% As then , it is the working class and the poor who are paying dearly for , and suffering the consequences of , this , whether in Europe or in the poorest countries on earth . #% As a result of the decisions taken at the Copenhagen Summit last December , accession treaties for the new Member States joining the Union are to be signed on 16 April . #% I took some persuading that a directive such as this was necessary at all . #% My understanding is that it is the committee that gave the all-clear which is the committee on which we are relying . #% But that should not in any way interfere with the need of Parliament here to take what documents this Parliament wishes and to scrutinise them in the best way possible . #% On the other hand , we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty . #% It is time for this Parliament to stand by the victims of failed regulatory mechanisms and to insist that an equitable settlement be finalised for the policyholders of Equitable Life . #% Mr President , all I would like to say is to express my deep appreciation to you and to the Members of this House for the welcome they have given today to the members of the Northern Ireland Assembly . #% My question does not just refer to the Mobotu funds that are spread throughout Europe and lying dormant in banks or are perhaps being used by undesirable types . #% Mr President , Mr De Rossa mentioned me in particular and challenged me to an argument . #% When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable . #% He said no small group of countries should be able to block decisions , and this is so . #% If we really want to protect children then surely those people would have voted to ban the use of fragrances in baby products . #% Let us ensure that all new legislation is crime-proof and existing legislation is evaluated . #% In the context of the WTO talks , I am concerned primarily about agriculture . #% However , the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe 's neighbours , who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country . #% One oft-quoted example of such a bad patent is Amazon 's ` one-click ' shopping method . #% We want peace - yes , but not at any cost . #% It has to be highlighted that the opening-up of postal services does not always bring benefits in terms of an increased level of employment and I would ask the Commission to address this in a detailed study that will be given equality , efficiency and customer-orientation in the postal sector , particularly as regards those peripheral areas . #% What you have done here today is damaging to people at grass-roots level and to the political system and to democracy . #% There was a very notable case where a German child had been abducted to Western Samoa and there were others abducted to France and North Africa . #% Why should it be possible for ropey convictions , secured by lesser standards than those applicable in the United Kingdom , to be held against United Kingdom citizens in their own country ? #% Mr President , Darfur continues to be a humanitarian crisis . #% I welcome the fact that their decision clears the way for the conclusion of the accession negotiations for the first new Member States . #% We need to foster cooperation between the Member States and get common approaches to share problems and opportunities and get a better balanced development with an integrated approach across the sectors . #% I can tell him to take off the earphones now , I am going to proceed in English . #% - There is doubt that the correct legal basis was used for this proposal . #% There has been an increasing awareness that modern medicines do not always provide relief for all possible conditions and many people have found herbal medicines to be an important element of their health regime . #% The bigger EU States like France , Germany and the United Kingdom traded about 30 % of GDP in the 1960s as against 60 % today , but they enjoyed much faster economic growth at that time than they do now . #% I am extremely pleased that no initiatives were taken on the environment sector and the reference period projects relating to coastal erosion are notable , something I have been advocating for a long time . #% 
We must , at the same time , overcome difficulties to ensure that crossborder crime is tackled without curtailing the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators . #% I believe that in this way Europe can make real added value and move towards its goals of the Lisbon Process . #% Finally , I would like to say to the Commission that I do not honestly see the logic behind this . #% I should also like to remind Members of this House that what has happened in East Timor after the referendum is something we should look at . #% The environment is more important at this stage than a few hundred jobs . #% Above all it needs monitoring . #% Finally , I welcome the continued efforts of Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten to renew a cease-fire in the region . #% I unreservedly condemn the atrocities carried out by both sides in this conflict . #% GM citizenship may be for some ; it is not for me . #% The bottom line is that the Doha Round should ensure that average industrial tariffs outside the EU fall to less than 10 % . #% We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992 , when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets . #% At the same time , the European public is well aware - since 60 % of them or more work in service industries - that there are possibilities for EU firms in widespread trade in services . #% Parliament could play its role as watchdog much more effectively and ensure that the money is spent on the core objectives of the Union 's development cooperation defined in the Treaty : the reduction - and ultimately the eradication - of poverty . #% The word ` interoperability ' is appearing increasingly frequently . #% Mr President , groundwater is a priceless natural resource , not a national resource , and it should be treated as a resource without which humanity can not survive . #% Nuclear energy in the United States has cost US$ 1 trillion , one million million dollars . #% UNIFIL procured for South Lebanon decades of stability , notwithstanding the horrific civil war which that country endured until recently . #% In terms of these regulations , a complaint which I have encountered is that the process of application is unduly burdensome and bureaucratic . #% The proposal is also relevant for the assessment of national allocation plans under the proposed emissions trading directive , which is going through at the moment . #% The fact is that market conditions do not always provide ` must carry ' . #% I hope the Commissioner will do some work on this . #% These are aims and values which we all share , a fact borne out by the unanimous adoption of Ms Lucas ' report . #% in writing . - Promoting labour standards through the EU 's negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries . #% I come from a country that , tragically , has a history of mass emigration over hundreds of years . #% Of course , if we are going to callously shut down sugar production in Ireland and the EU , we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers ... even if just to salve our consciences . #% In many cases , it is as if animals rather than human beings were being brought into the country . #% Belmarsh security unit in England , which I visited recently , is a virtual concrete tomb in which prisoners are incarcerated for long periods of time . #% Only the roadmap provides the basis on which progress can be made towards a just and lasting two-state solution . #% I was shocked to hear some of the comments that were made about her personally and I in no way subscribe to them . #% Milk prices have plummeted to 14.5 pence per litre , a loss of 4 pence per litre for all milk producers . #% It is compounded by questions of transparency and whether the proposals are not already obsolete . #% I welcome this report on the need to upgrade the railway systems within the European Union , as well as guaranteeing the most efficient use of railway infrastructure to meet consumer needs . #% The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future . #% People involved in it need some predictability for their business margins . #% In particular , it is quite incredible that Parliament should not criticise - since it has often criticised - its role as regards the Commission and that we should not be able to dismiss individual Commissioners rather than the Commission as a collegiate body , because Parliament will never use that power . #% In conclusion , I also welcome the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty was enacted three days ago and the European Commission has been given enhanced powers to bring forward legislation in the field of consumer affairs with particular emphasis on the protection of human health . #% We believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion , but also where there is wrongdoing to ensure full accountability which so far , regretfully , has either been unforthcoming or begrudging . #% It was written and signed in 1957 and it bears all the hallmarks of the philosophy and expectations of that time which are no longer applicable . #% It is ironic that we should be talking , on the one hand , about creating employment and , on the other hand , cutting jobs ourselves by our own actions . #% In my opinion , we need to adopt a two-fold approach in order to attempt to mitigate the effects of depressed prices on our farmers . #% I know that in Ireland , my own country , the government has bilateral agreements signed with Romania and Nigeria and is planning to sign more in the future . #% I apologise for being a member of a Conference of Presidents which may have put you in the embarrassing position of thinking you would not have to come to the Chamber . #% The integrity of the Union requires all who believe in it to proceed together along the same road and in the same direction , as clearly set out by our founding fathers . #% This is another area of grave concern . #% Defining ` sludge ? in the Annex might help clarify the situation . #% I concur with the people of Ireland . #% I also agree that more research is required to take account of the exposure of children to risks from sources other than toys . #% I want to stress the work of the Internal Market Committee as an active partner in the better regulation process . #% Lawlessness can not be allowed to be the answer to lawlessness . #% The fact that it remains in place is a good thing , as also that it can be altered and changed to adapt to changing circumstances . #% One of the relevant issues raised by the Committee on Employment is that the measures proposed by Member States complement other actions cofinanced by the Structural Funds , and really we need more than a simple confirmation that this is the case . #% Madam President , I just wish to refer to the last item on page 4 - the statement by Mrs Green , leader of the socialists - in the English version of the Minutes . #% The same kind of legislation could be introduced in Europe with regard to corruption so that anybody in Europe involved in corruption or bribing officials in Africa or any other Third World country could and should be charged under legislation in their home country . #% I would just like to take us back a little bit . #% BSE and foot-and-mouth have added a new and unexpected dimension to the European agenda . #% Mr President , firstly I should like to pay tribute to my colleagues Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo for their excellent report which I support . #% However , where I would differ from my colleagues is in trying to use strong-arm tactics against the Member State governments by telling them what they can and can not do . #% The family , as was recognised by the drafters of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , is fundamental in protecting and promoting the rights of the child . #% I respect politically why you say that but it shows scant regard and little understanding for the due process in this Parliament . #% It has sat and twiddled its thumbs , waiting for an invitation from Indonesia , the country that has been illegally occupying East Timor for the last 25 years , whose Foreign Minister has stuck his fingers up at the UN General Assembly when the issue was raised . #% The fact that an agreement was struck between Parliament and the Council is , in no small measure , due to the unstinting efforts of the rapporteur , who made every effort to keep all the political groups on side and who vigorously defended the views of Parliament with the other institutions . #% I welcome the work that has been done in this area , which relates to the whole issue of the perception of the European Union in Member States . #% The reality is that the Commission representatives continue to refuse to make any analysis even in the face of the decision taken by the Transport Council last March to call for a study of the situation . #% A political group , the Referendum Party , that is a meaningless party in Britain , is interfering in internal Irish politics . #% I support adoption of the Buzek report , which will enable the common position compromise agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission to put in place and implement the Seventh Framework Programme , despite my disappointment that the budget allocated to research and technological development has been reduced . #% Existing policies on drugs have failed to prevent illegal drug trafficking , which is now more intense and more deadly than ever before . #% 
It is typical of the man that he died trying to fulfil his mission of peace . #% Mr President , we live in a European Union in which an internal market operates and where there is free movement of goods , persons , services and capital . #% After the Dutroux scandal in Belgium there was a flurry of activity and there seemed to be a determination to ensure that Europol would be given the necessary powers to discharge its responsibilities . #% There are however , particularly in Ireland , a substantial number of borrowers on fixed rates , sometimes at interest which is three times higher than the current rates and which lending institutions are unwilling to adjust without substantial financial penalties . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner to the House . #% However , there are times when particular airline rules , or , indeed , the attitude of a captain , can have a very negative impact on the travelling experience . #% Experience shows us that in the very short term they may succeed but the only thing those countries can do is to provide their own workers with lower standards of living . #% Since the beginning of your tenure , Commissioner Byrne , you have responded to the needs of the consumers of Europe by making every effort to improve the safety of the food chain . #% The review should be by an independent body and not by those who have vested interests in the continuation of fishing by the EU . #% The whole principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to have been done away with here . #% I also strongly hold that national standards and legislation must not be overridden or diluted by EU activities , including EU-funded research . #% Mr President , first of all I would like to pay tribute to all who served on the recent EU election observation mission to Pakistan , particularly the members of my core team and also the European Parliament delegation led by Miss Grönfeldt Bergman . #% I congratulate Mr Sterckx for producing an excellent report and I would urge Members of this House to support it enthusiastically . #% Mr President , concern for public health must the overriding consideration for everybody associated with the food industry . #% This initiative will aid the concept of a European judicial culture so that the entire citizenry of the EU will be treated fairly and with dignity . #% It is to allow the fishermen , under the supervision already agreed at the early part of the closure , to continue right through that closure . #% The number of community and cross-border groups brought together in projects financed by the fund reaches into the hundreds . #% In particular , I congratulate my colleague , the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , on the passion he has sustained on this issue , despite all the various problems he faced from industry and the different political groups in this House , not least his own group . #% I am referring in particular to certain recommendations relating to agricultural and structural funds . #% Lastly , no matter what anybody says , the financial perspective is the only game in town . #% This will cause an increase of heavy road traffic in the Limerick city area . #% There are a number of paragraphs I have doubts about - 14 , 15 and 16 for example , regarding the legal basis and whether it is necessary to involve both national and European responsibility to resolve problems of fraud that affect national states more than they do the European Union . #% However , the traffic laws , roads , weather , etc. are so different that a national test and licence will remain essential for a driver . #% Mr President , nicotine is regarded as a highly addictive drug . #% Transport is , of course , a particularly difficult area and action is needed . #% It is disappointing that the ECR Group and its Conservative Members , who are clearly against any financial transaction tax , have chosen in their statements to deliberately misrepresent today 's vote as a call for an EU-only FTT . #% We have half a diabetic nurse post to cater for 250 people , when there should be one for 50 people in order to be effective . #% Mr President , common sense seems to have abandoned the PPE-DE Group and the Liberals on this issue . #% They are used in all sorts of applications , some essential , others less so : in insulating foams , aerosols , refrigeration and air conditioning systems , in fire protection equipment and even in the soles of air technology jogging shoes . #% We must never again experience the traumatic events of recent months and the understandable consumer concern with regard to food safety . #% There has been a certain diversity of views , Mr Prodi , among your nominee Commissioners about their personal political accountability in the future . #% That is progress of some sort , small though it may be . #% However , I should like to ask , based on that and the assessment you have already made , what further steps the Commissioner would recommend to control the continued emissions of radionuclides from Sellafield and La Hague . #% Therefore , we need our scientists to get their heads together on this and resolve it . #% I also call on the Commission , as guardian of the Treaties , to ensure that the requirement for unanimity is upheld . #% We all wish you well . #% I was particularly moved by what Commissioner Piebalgs said in his opening statement about the people who went in immediately after the accident to do the clean-up work , to try to put concrete into the sarcophagus , and to try to protect the rest of the population . #% Firstly , the Irish presidency was entrusted with the task of producing a draft treaty to replace Maastricht . #% We need to ensure that indigenous energy sources can play a major role in energy supply . #% In the interests of openness and transparency , there should be a clear breakdown and a clear outline of how much is going where and what the results are . #% Mr President , I too should like to welcome the McCartney family members to the Chamber . #% I am particularly pleased that we have achieved the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in this new programme . #% It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it . #% Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree with me that there are selfish as well as selfless reasons for refocusing our effort on the developing world ? #% They are now threatened with a full-scale invasion by a so-called Christian power , resulting in countless dead . #% We must put in place appropriate re-training measures to ensure that the people who lost their jobs at Dell can secure employment in the near future . #% Initially , Sinn Féin 's Alex Maskey vehemently denied IRA involvement but , two weeks later , having spoken to the family , Sinn Féin 's Gerry Kelly issued a statement on the matter and they accepted IRA involvement . #% This brings us to the point of the difficulty of these regulations . #% I should like to say that this report addresses many current concerns in the fisheries sector and certainly rebuilding the stocks of cod and hake is going to be a tremendous challenge . #% But I want to request that the Swiebel report be postponed to a later date . #% That is of vital importance . #% Madam President , I would like to say that Parliament 's position is a balanced one and has weighed up all the pros and cons in this debate . #% The Irish Government is currently the only EU government currently 100 % in favour of the cancellation of the poorest countries ' debts . #% I have made a proposal in the European Convention that we should bring Europe home by having a coordinated European Week in each of the national parliaments , where we would invite a Commissioner to a national parliament to present the annual legislative programme ; where the MEPs from a particular Member State would be present in the Parliament ; where you would generate some national interest in what the European Union is doing , and what the European Parliament proposes to do in terms of scrutinising the Commission and the Council for the following year . #% The operation of the national security law was certainly a problem and there was a serious problem concerning long-term political prisoners . #% We must be equitable and fair as to how that is done . #% DCI has formalised structures , recognising the important function that Parliament should play in its role as overseer and adviser . #% These reports dovetail nicely with yesterday 's Commission communication on ` The new generation of education and training programmes ' setting out future programmes intended to replace the current Socrates , Leonardo da Vinci , Tempus , Youth , Culture 2000 and Media Plus from 2007 . #% Surely we could find better uses for the EUR 230 million or even EUR 290 million , as some want , than promoting this contrived notion of European citizenship . #% Government ministers oppose anti-aircraft defences and have made it clear that plants that lie in the flight paths of large airports can be shut down if they are rated as serious risk . #% While hake may not yet be in such dire straits , it is still far below the level which is appropriate , and the warning bells have been ringing now for quite some time . #% In Brazil , the rain forest is being destroyed to grow sugar that nobody wants , so sugar-based bio-ethanol is being produced instead . #% Commissioner Fischler told us we had no co-responsibility , but that our views would be taken into consideration . #% I should like to end with a good news story , a dramatic example of a fiscal incentive to prevent , minimise , reuse and recycle and an example of how each Member State can determine its own mix of prevention , reuse and recycling to meet targets . #% I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty . #% In the course of lunchtime today I received a telephone call from a prominent radio station in my constituency which attributed opinions and behaviour along the following lines indirectly to myself as a Member of this Parliament in relation to our new building in Brussels : ' there are people in Brussels who are getting massive backhanders , there is serious racketeering going on , the procedures in Parliament have not been properly followed and Parliament has gone against its own Rules in the matter of its buildings policy . ' #% 
At the same time , we recognise that there has been some movement in this area . #% The national alcohol policy will discourage under-age and excessive drinking through promotion of alcoholism-awareness and encouragement of participation in alternative activities . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , the first thing I want to make clear here tonight is that this is not about third-country imports . #% Fundamental to farmers ' practice of constant innovation is free access and exchange of seeds and genetic material . #% We now need immediate and well-focused action to restore consumer confidence and eradicate the BSE disease . #% Universal suffrage in elections to the Yemeni Parliament is especially praiseworthy in the context of the all-male electorates in neighbouring states in the region . #% Mr President , the goalposts have now changed , given the sheer level of inhumanity shown by terrorists pursuing their so-called political objectives . #% Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca for his usual , very cooperative and consensual approach . #% As one of the leaders and front runners for enlargement , it has proved itself capable of throwing off the yoke of totalitarian communism and building a new market-based economy , creating new opportunities in education , improving its infrastructure and industrial capacity and developing its tourism and agriculture . #% I accept that maybe not all the fears are real , but even the perceived fears need to be dealt with before they get out of hand and become too politicised . #% Mr President , in relation to the labour-intensive industries the problem is competition from third countries , the cheap labour countries . #% All countries , regardless of their size , influence or form of government should begin a process of decommissioning their nuclear arsenals as soon as possible . #% Having a loving invested mother is the ideal for a child , which we should make every effort to accommodate where a woman wants to be available to her child in those early years . #% France and Holland emphatically rejected the Constitution , so we slapped a gagging order on the countries which it was feared might also say ` No ' . #% Furthermore , what is the Commission doing about monitoring the returnees into Rwanda when they reach their villages ? #% We all need to put beyond doubt the absence of a cost factor in the exchange mechanism . #% I hope we have achieved that and that it will be reflected in a strong endorsement of the report tomorrow . #% Technical measures assume an even greater importance in the likely event that the Council will not adopt a rigorous programme to reduce fleet capacity . #% Something more profound is needed than relabelling old wine in new bottles . #% Copyright is there to protect software . #% It is not perfect , but at least it is something . #% While we want to be positive about many of the changes that are taking place in China , we can not , and indeed must not , turn a blind eye to the continuing abuse of human rights , in particular the scandalous treatment of political dissidents and members of religious faiths . #% I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention . #% As a result , it should now be possible to identify clearly what has been paid for . #% It is a long-established principle of EU law -- built up over many years of case law and underpinned by Article 230 ( 4 ) of the EC Treaty -- that citizens need to have a direct and individual concern in order to have a standing in the ECJ . #% Mr President , the introduction of the single European currency into the European Union is now only a matter of twelve months away . #% I would like to cross-examine the Commissioner on this report , on the implications of duty-free for jobs . #% Interventions should target low-income households , as defined by the national legislation in force . #% While the top 20 % in the EU receive 73 % of direct aid , our farm survey shows that approximately 40 % of payments went to the 20 % of farmers with the highest family farm income . #% The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry . #% So when I hear the Commission talk about EU values and standards , in view of its support for sanctions on Iraq I wonder how sincere it is about the children in Turkey . #% Mr President , I really think this is much ado about very little . #% One needs only to look at Denmark . #% This means that a half a million citizens die needlessly in Europe each year because of an addiction to tobacco products . #% Commissioner , what is the value of a territorial pact without social partners and are we going to accept recycled projects that are not in the spirit of the confidence pact ? #% While there are some good possibilities in there , most of it basically requires an effort of political will on the part of Member States . #% I think you should be more balanced and should observe the order that people indicate . #% It will be up to the Irish parliament to decide what defence missions our forces become engaged in . #% The peace process in Ireland has benefited hugely from the EU budget . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her excellent work in this area . #% Any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers . #% While broadly supporting the guarantee fund , it must be stressed that the success of the fund will depend on certain key tenets being addressed in its structure . #% At the moment we depend too heavily on exporting our waste , because we do not have the infrastructure in place to do so locally , despite a great catch-up over recent years . #% Why should we in Europe hand over this opportunity and this potential to New Zealand and Australia . #% This is one of the most serious abuses of human rights in the world today . #% This is all about ensuring that women have the freedom to choose . #% We oppose attempts to turn the EU into a superstate or a military and economic superpower . #% Shifting the finishing line and imposing onerous time constraints at this stage would display a lack of good faith on our part as it unscrambles the hard-won result of the final trialogue on the revised directive earlier this year , as outlined in recital 6 to that directive , which I understood to list , for each new Member State , the date relating to the derogation . #% May I say in conclusion that farmers have always responded in a positive way to the introduction of regulations governing public health and the health status of animals raised for food production . #% So I want to ask you if you agree that some measures need to be put in place for SMEs which will require refinancing , and what role the Commission could play . #% It would introduce a form of creeping protectionism and an attempt to block the completion of the internal market in sensitive sectors . #% Because this is causing major problems to the mobility of our citizens , particularly the disabled and the invalided , in the areas I have referred to . #% But let us be honest , the textile industry in Europe is one of the lowest paid too and the more educated our workforce becomes , the less inclined they are to take up the sewing machine . #% The Member States , as well as the Commission , have clear responsibilities in this area . #% Mr President , 1997 is a critical juncture in terms of setting the future guidelines for cohesion and the regional policy of the EU . #% It is appalling to think that in 2006 , in a European Union which prides itself on its commitment both to freedom of trade and freedom of movement , a Member State can be plagued by an organisation so vicious that even the world 's biggest oil companies can not survive its menace . #% Human rights clauses have been included in EU international or trade agreements for more than 50 years . #% Mr President , I welcome the Commission and Mr Trichet . #% The EU is not adhering to the precautionary principle , as it is supposed to . #% I support the Commission 's proposals for regulation on this issue and believe , broadly-speaking , that it is a good thing . #% While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems , we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins . #% However , the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP . #% For that reason I would like to take this opportunity , even though I know the subject is probably more appropriately dealt with in the report on marital cooperation in legal issues which we will be dealing with at the next part-session . #% To do so denies the fact that they cause damage . #% The precautionary principle is something that we must adhere to within the European Union and it must be respected at all times . #% Ironically , Mr Sterckx 's report points out that six months later , neither France nor Spain had designated safe havens and contingency plans to the Commission , as required by EU law . #% 
Good luck Commissioner . #% We need mutual respect between all the institutions of the European Union , and an understanding that power does not rest within one institution alone and that we are interdependent on each other . #% My final point is that much mention has been made recently in Parliament of the ongoing work of the European Convention . #% What is our responsibility as a result ? #% The reality is that we have neglected our transport and rail systems at a national level . #% We too must prevent further terrorist attacks , and this can only be achieved if the international community continues to work closely together . #% As we move towards a new Millennium we are facing new problems associated with the wealth which is being created and the extra economic growth . #% We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence-building mechanism . #% It is outrageous that no warning signals were sounded while Parmalat funds were being embezzled . #% But let me ask you what exactly is the situation ? #% Why was it a surprise that there was genocide since the referendum two weeks ago ? #% I am sure the honourable Member from Northern Ireland who placed this question heard me unequivocally answer the question that he has put . #% Madam President , first of all congratulations to Mr Linkohr , not least for his persistence and his patience over the years . #% It is in that context that we should be talking about taxation on passenger cars and indeed all vehicles . #% As the Commission 's Green Paper on demography states , there is no economic growth without population growth . #% Mr President , although it is hard to imagine from the relative comfort and security of a western European country like Ireland , globally persecution is more widespread than ever . #% Like my colleague , Mr De Rossa , I did not have time to speak in the House yesterday . #% Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament . #% Mr President , systematic abuse and denial of human rights continues in mainland China , yet the Western world remains embarrassingly silent . #% There is no demand , no logic and no justification for the liberalisation of postal services . #% in writing . - The issue voted on refers to the need of the European Institutions to repeal Council Acts which have , through the passage of time and the development of technology , become obsolete and irrelevant to the correct functioning of the Union . #% In five months time or so , when the Irish Prime Minister comes to this Parliament to report on Ireland 's presidency , he will be judged on one aspect in particular and that will have to do with the effectiveness of the measures taken during the presidency to deal with the unemployment situation . #% In Ireland we need more regionalization and less centralization . #% They wo n't . #% I hope that we will learn the lessons for the next programme of structural funds and that a regulation will be drawn up that will be easier to administer and that will not try to do everything for everybody in the entire Community with a very limited amount of money . #% We need more time to look at the evaluation and to ensure that the proper operation takes place . #% Firstly , there was the matter of general principle that , in the interests of promoting better , simpler and clearer legislation , the introduction of an unevenly weighted , dual legal basis represents a dangerous direction and precedent in European policy-making . #% The point I am making here is that there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic providing we make the policy choices now about what we are going to face in the future . #% Of course , this is all set against the continuing crisis in the eurozone , as each day goes by evidencing the folly of the single currency model . #% People are paying higher prices for organic produce . #% The Energy Committee of the European Parliament is right to urge the European Commission to press for negotiations with a view to removing uncertainties by conferring a binding force on the protocol on nuclear safety within this Charter . #% This was observed by the radiological protection institute in Ireland in 1994 , exactly one year after the British granted BNFL the licence , which is responsible for the environmental mess that we now have on our hands . #% Ireland 's derogation for domestic water charges is not as strong as I would want it to be . #% What is all conflict about ? #% We need patents in order to protect our own companies and investments so that they can be effective global players in this fast-changing and rapidly developing software-development market . #% I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government . #% But we have already committed 80 % of the budget in agriculture and structural funds . #% Commissioner , you know that this is not the case , that we are ready to help developing countries in any way necessary as we are helping applicant countries , that we have science on our side and that we will not abandon our hard-won progress - why should we ? #% We hope to increase it further . #% I was not sniggering at the comment . #% In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure . #% Robert Mugabe has been strutting the world stage for far too long now and has been behaving in a most dictatorial and brutal fashion towards his own people , and particularly towards opponents within his country . #% However , we do not believe it is possible for the EU to set adequate pension levels or , indeed , to harmonise retirement ages . #% Regardless of the circumstances whereby EU funds are disbursed , we can not wash our hands and hope for the best . #% I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison ? #% I am sure Commissioner Fischler is also pleased about that . #% The financial services industry is a global industry and our efforts must remain on securing a transaction tax that is effective and workable on a global level . #% This is highly regrettable because , in the eyes of many , it is felt that the targets set by the Kyoto Accord will not even achieve the goal of substantially reducing the use of greenhouse gases . #% Mr President , congratulations on a particularly focused summit as regards : the clarity of the objectives ; the analysis of the tasks needed to meet those objectives ; and the built-in progress-chasing system . #% The first few weeks of the lives of newborn children are invaluable for the development of trust , sensory-cognitive skills and a bond with both their parents . #% Dr David Nabarro , UN coordinator for avian and human influenza , has stressed that , to prevent a pandemic of human infection , the global response to the bird flu epidemic must be intensified . #% What has been totally unacceptable is the reported anti-French hysteria , in particular that attributed to the Washington Government establishment . #% The European Union is only 50 % selfsufficient and stocks are falling , yet prices continue to go down . #% Mr President , congratulations to the rapporteurs and Commissioner Papoutsis , who has not had an easy task here . #% I am absolutely amazed that the Commission and Council can so easily agree on taking away the role of Parliament . #% The announcement of the continued financial support from the European Union is exactly what Northern Ireland needs at this critical time . #% Apart from that , it has largely been a failure . #% I look forward to the day when the EU will be compliant with its Kyoto obligation on f-gases . #% But today is an opportunity for this House to review the investiture process and to place on record some of the questions or observations that arise from that . #% The exact date for the transposition in the Member States is missing . #% Therefore we are at a permanent geographical and structural disadvantage . #% One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public . #% The Irish presidency has tabled a paper on this question which envisages the possibility of a general provision on non-discrimination as well as a suitable legal basis to adopt legislative measures to prevent such discrimination . #% Legally , our arguments are sound . #% We must reach a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen , and for that , we need from our European leaders real political courage and less of the waffle . #% As regards the car-park , I have had difficulty once or twice in finding my car but I found it in the end . #% 
in writing . - I abstained on the vote on the Domenici report despite the vast majority of sensible proposals contained in it . #% I would like to ask what competence Members think we have to condemn another sovereign nation because its country refuses to fund projects it disagrees with . #% I also extend my compliments to Mr Whitehead on the thoroughness of his report . #% In the past two decades or so , many initiatives have been trialled which have been aimed at getting those from demographic groups traditionally disinclined towards university to attend third-level institutions . #% Decommissioning of nuclear power stations is not research . #% I would remind Mr Kirkhope and others that the experience in Northern Ireland and everywhere else is that by labelling sections of society you actually increase alienation and you drive recruitment to the organisations that are engaged in terrorism . #% I am an Irish Member of the European Parliament and we in Ireland know how difficult that can be . #% If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it . #% Such a development would also make a nonsense of these countries ' achievements in providing basic health and education support , which have contributed so much to furthering the well-being of their peoples . #% It is something I feel strongly about but I can not say there is one view within the Council on this matter . #% I believe that it is only by pressure that we will make progress . #% The report on temporary protection represents the recognition of the desire at the level of the European Union for a coordinated joint action to deal with the situation where there is a sudden mass influx of displaced persons resulting from an armed conflict in their own countries . #% It is clearly stated in Article 176 that no stricter measures can be taken by a Member State unless they are compatible with the Treaty , i.e. unless they are proportionate , non-discriminatory and do not create unjustified barriers to the single market . #% We must ensure that the burden to take back WEEE rests with the manufactures , not the retailers . #% The rapid growth of air conditioning needs to be taken into account more , the possibilities open to Member States in the form of inducements should be clarified , and many of the definitions need to be tightened . #% What do we want , and what is the way forward ? #% Such a practice is in breach of established international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights . #% Among the measures used in different regions are : the use of observers to monitor a fishery and temporarily close it when there are too many small fish ; banning the discarding of fish ; and requiring the industry to submit plans on how they themselves will conduct the fishery in order to keep discards low . #% EU governments are also committed to playing a key role in the reconstruction of Iraq ; the EU made a five-year commitment at the donors ' conference in 2003 and will be at the forefront in providing financial assistance to the new Iraqi administration . #% Individuals are not being treated as individuals , they are being treated as groups coming from the country concerned . #% I strongly believe that Parliament should endorse the opinion of the report before it . #% I welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in Europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover . #% We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth ? #% The intention of the introduction of this legislation , as I said earlier , was protection of health and safety . #% It will ensure that we in Europe can give the very highest standard of jobs , training and , most importantly of all , social protection to all our citizens . #% We have heard from various Members about the disparities in fines and controls in Member States , which I do not have enough time to address now . #% Commissioner , you mentioned that the figures do not show the real burden of the disease of mental health . #% I was honoured to take on this role at the request of the Committee on Petitions . #% But we should not impose on those who are ready by that time the burden and failures of those who may not be and therefore we must still cleave to this notion of differentiation as the leitmotif through which we should analyse the outcomes . #% We can no longer ignore threats from climate change on coastal erosion . #% Have we not learnt anything from the recent referendum on the Treaty of Nice in Ireland ? #% However , there is an urgent need for greater cooperation between the 25 Member States ' enforcement agencies , especially now that our land borders , post-enlargement , have increased by over one third to more than 3 000 km and also because of the acknowledged links between the significant , though unquantified , illegal wildlife trade and organised crime . #% Research shows that the situation in my own state of Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe . #% Yet we have no evidence , as has been constantly repeated in this House this morning , that Iraq has weapons of the kind referred to by the hawks in the American Government . #% But , if you are going to bring this scheme in it has to be mandatory and it has to be introduced in every Member State . #% It may upset the consensus here this morning , and I do not mean any offence by this , but could many of the new Members of this Parliament even name the Ombudsman ? #% The European Union must complement Irish legislation on this matter , especially as there will be one million mobile phones in Ireland by the end of 1998 . #% Mr President , this report , by my good friend Mrs d'Ancona , has both positive and negative aspects . #% I have been encouraged by the growing influence that the European Union clearly has on many countries in the world . #% The issues of debate in formulating the new structure for human rights have been many : #% Yes , the scientific jury is out , but 13 out of 23 developing countries working under the WHO guidelines have serious problems with fluoride poisoning , or fluorosis , in the dental care of their people . #% We have already had the example of 11 September . #% I am delighted that such an important opportunity has arisen for children to enjoy the same access to innovative new medicines as adults already enjoy . #% One of the major components of the political dialogue is the subject of this report , namely democratisation , the protection of human rights and the operation of the rule of law . #% Likewise , when it came to an opportunity there to join in condemning Zimbabwe for its mass forced evictions , the EU countries also avoided that issue . #% The aim of the new centre is to overcome the problems of the present arrangements and to develop and implement projects more coherently across the territories of what will be the 25 Member States of the EU . #% The time has come for us to take a long-term rather than just a 6-months to 12-months view . #% Successive Taoisigh of the present government 's persuasion including DeValera , Lemass , Cosgrove and Lynch have expressly stated that Ireland has no traditional policy of neutrality and would take foreign policy decisions on a case-by-case basis . #% I would like to highlight what I believe are some of the key elements in the reform of state-owned and private enterprises in developing countries . #% The Treaty was fairly modest by any standards , but it was very difficult to explain the issues to the people . #% We heard this week that in the United Kingdom for every one proven case of foot-and-mouth , animals have been slaughtered on five or six farms around that case . #% We need to do all we can with the competence we have . #% As already mentioned by some of my colleagues and , in particular , my Scottish colleague , peripheral areas of Europe would be more adversely affected than others by these restrictions . #% Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement . #% As well as that , as President Barroso rightly mentioned himself , despite high employment participation levels in many countries in recent years , many people with disabilities , and 74 % in total , were unemployed , despite the fact that they had access to education and training , because of the psychological barriers and blockage that existed . #% Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues , and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns . #% In recent events in the Congo , approximately 50 000 people have been victims of the use of light weapons . #% Secondly , what is the Council going to do in relation to a number of EU citizens who are imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay , as it is clear that the British are too scared to stand up to the Americans and defend their own citizens ? #% The gates were locked . #% Junior doctors play a critical role in patient care . #% The time has come when this House must face up to the fact that the fishermen from the North and the South of Ireland , for the first time in history , have come together to face this particular problem . #% Last-minute efforts to shelve the motion , without consultation , threatened to set a dangerous precedent that , in my view , would have significantly damaged the credibility both of the urgency procedure and perhaps , more importantly , Parliament 's work on human rights issues generally . #% I entirely support the creation of a European Research Council to give some coordination and coherence to our work , particularly in basic research . #% I accept that this strategy also has to be seen in the wider context of sustainable development requirements - that our current needs have to be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs . #% We are politicians ; we want to decide it ourselves . #% I voted against that agreement , which was blocked by Parliament out of concern for the privacy rights of European citizens and companies , put at risk by unregulated bulk data-sharing arrangements . #% 
We have the Birds Directive , the Habitats Directive , the common agricultural policy , the common fisheries policy , the structural funds , 18 000 Natura 2000 sites , plus a network , and yet we have no joined-up thinking in relation to this issue . #% You put tremendous effort into it . #% They have to manage their currencies in the common interest . #% In conclusion , it is incumbent on all legislators within the European Union to ensure that the utmost is being done to ensure that air travellers are entirely safe in the journeys they take . #% One of the most important issues we have to discover is not to go down the simple road of saying ` you are either for a federal Europe or against it ' . #% Undisputed statistics clearly demonstrate , since the setting up of the Thorp plant , wholesale increases in the amount of nuclear materials found in concentrations in seaweed in Ireland . #% In an ideal world , responsible businesses would respond to consumer needs . #% Predatory behaviour of seals around the Irish and Scottish coasts amounts to the total allowable catch plus one quarter . #% The intolerance of the State and the courts of France against these Protestants should have been mentioned and condemned . #% The EU is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people . #% We need to stop the export refunds granted in relation to third countries for slaughter , irrespective of whether conditions are being complied with or not . #% Mr President , this new directive outlaws tobacco advertising in the printed media in the whole of Europe and will also prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on radio and on the internet . #% We , the Commission and the Council should be partners in seeking to be effective , and not competitive and seeking to keep things secretively to ourselves . #% But this directive has never been transposed into national law . #% The vessels being built must support local industry and local coastal fishing . #% Although she was actually speaking to Mrs Ahern , I hope that whatever happens to Kyoto , we would pursue policies on a no-regrets basis , which , apart from helping the climate , make complete business sense . #% I broadly welcome this report and I want to focus in particular on Amendment No 20 , Recital 26 ( new ) , which states that the Commission will consider proposals for the establishment of a Centralised Electronic European Union Causebook and Judgment Registry Database . #% Finally , let us assume here you have the power to do all of this - and you are telling us you have ; why then was there no effort to reduce or eliminate bank bonuses ? #% This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria . #% It is absolutely ridiculous and it has to end . #% Forgive me for being sceptical . #% . I would like to thank the Presidency for that reply . #% That is a practical measure of the potential if we can get the policies and methods right . #% It has stable democratic structures and the economic indicators are quite close to our Community average . #% However , it should be up to each Member State to decide how this should be done . #% Inconsistency and hypocrisy such as this leaves the West in general open to the charge that it is selective in its definition of terrorism and is primarily influenced by the perceived threat to western interests . #% I believe that the overriding consideration is that the agency must operate in strict conformity with Community interests . #% I am pleased that the report recognises the role played by the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in maintaining employment in coastal , island and remote regions . #% I am not surprised that the pharmaceutical industry is supporting this directive , since it plays right into their hands and means more business for them . #% The family can then reduce the tax they have to pay by choosing a more energy-efficient car which satisfies the family 's transport needs . #% This is no easy task . #% We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways , or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues . #% I believe it would be a mistake to try to push that through again . #% It will not , however , bring them justice : for this , I call on those present on that fateful night to have courage and testify against those who committed this crime . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , first of all , can I take the opportunity of welcoming you , Commissioner , to your new post , and may you have a very successful term . #% I hope that further funding will be made available during the programme , in particular when new Member States join . #% We have a moral obligation to create permanent peace and stability , tackle the problem of the warlords , improve human rights , especially , as other speakers have pointed out , women 's rights , and establish real democracy in Afghanistan . #% Of the six greenhouse gases listed in the annex to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , three of them are fluorinated gases . #% It also fully supports the establishment of a solid legal framework for the European Environmental Economic Accounts as a positive step in the ` GDP and beyond ' process , and , indeed , welcomes the Commission initiative to present an index for environmental pressure , to be submitted alongside GDP . #% The public at large does not understand the tactical manoeuvring behind these battles . #% We are essentially undertaking an experiment . #% Working time will still be calculated over a 4 month period , with exemptions available to calculate over 12-months -- subject to stronger control through collective bargaining . #% Harmonising electoral systems for the European election could actually be detrimental to the very fair and equitable system that we have in Ireland , and most people in this Parliament are probably totally unaware of that . #% It is in the interests of all EU fishing industries to ensure that this is done . #% We have to deal with the legislation , the powers and the Treaties before us today , and not with what may be given to us in the future under any future Treaty . #% Ireland has identified the tourism sector as one area where it is possible to generate economic growth and new job opportunities for our young people . #% I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial , logistic and air support , including the necessary number of helicopters , as soon as possible . #% Fourthly , there is no provision in the Treaties and no place in this Parliament , the Council or the Commission for laying down conditions relating to workers ' pay - that is still exclusively a matter for the Member States . #% They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks . #% I also support Amendment 9 , which is in the same vein . #% In conclusion , my Group supports the compromise and tabled the full set of amendments involved . #% It can be done in international discussions . #% This is unacceptable to mainstream science . #% A scan showed damage to my brain , then different tests that were carried out by ophthalmologists for both hospitals and the National Council showed that permanent damage to my eyesight had occurred . #% Workers in the industry expect this , and the public most certainly does . #% Mr President , I shall be the last tonight to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very good report . #% What I am suggesting is that you , as President-in-Office of the Council , have a responsibility , under the various conventions I refer to , to ensure that these monies are returned to the various former colonies . #% We must provide not only a forum at European level through a convention , but also ensure that there are fora in every Member State , so that people in each Member State can talk and debate with each other with other people in Europe . #% The real winners would be the beef barons of South America , if we were to allow the European farmers to be sold out . #% Can you assure us that the Council will play its full part , in the same way that the Commission and Parliament have , in mobilizing the political resources of the European Union in bringing about a peaceful resolution to this conflict in Northern Ireland ? #% I am prepared , as rapporteur , to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary . #% In sitting down to draw up our long-term plans we should recognise the interests of the Union , its cohesiveness , its solidarity and its influence in the world . #% Our hope lies with our children and in trying to ensure that we inculcate in them a respect for the dignity of every human being , male and female , adult and child alike . #% I want to make it very clear from the outset that I , my delegation , and those I represent are totally in favour of improvement to the highest possible standards . #% If they feel that the EU or government does not seem to be working for them , they always have the office of the Ombudsman to turn to , to seek redress . #% It is highly efficient , a daily service to all sectors of the community in all parts of the country at a reasonable price . #% 
It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union . #% The directive reinforces judicial discretion and ensures that remedies are fair , equitable , proportionate and justified . #% We must not overlook the fact that pesticides play an important role in modern agriculture : using pesticides efficiently can increase crop yields and help maintain high standards of food quality and safety . #% We are exporting live animals to be processed in other countries and then we complain about the unemployment problem in Ireland . #% Europe is currently well behind other developed nations in implementing them . #% It is a pity that Parliament could not reciprocate with an equivalent level of attendance . #% While acknowledging the weight of the scientific evidence on the connection of BSE and CJD with the use of meat and bonemeal , it must be borne in mind that the level of BSE infestation proportionate to the individual herds in Member States is significantly small and is of course confined to a relatively short production cycle . #% The EU must learn from the best practice techniques available within the European Union to tackle health disorders , such as asthma , childhood allergies and neuro-development disorders . #% In 2003 , in the EU-25 commercial gaming industries , lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 51.5 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites . #% I got an opportunity to raise the whole area of human rights with the various ministers we met , and I got one concession with regard to access for the media . #% If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent , because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns . #% The central banks of these countries will then converge under the auspices of the European Central Bank in 1999 . #% I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another . #% I am a member of the Irish Government 's Task Force on the demand side of the problem which recently published an interim report . #% Some in this Parliament and other places may use Members ' passion for and belief in protecting the cultures and diversity of languages within the European Union as a way of attacking such Members . #% The applicant countries will also be confronted with a difficult process of adaptation in many areas ; for instance , justice and home affairs issues are central to the enlargement process . #% Because of the lack of proper control , mining companies have been able to get away with leaving behind , when they have finished their operations , a legacy which continues to pollute our environment and our water . #% Long-term , Europe needs to exercise greater vigilance in relation to world trade - which is now under consideration - and how decisions taken there impact on our processors and on our farmers . #% We can not continue to allow our children to be destroyed in this way by the drug underworld . #% Regarding the most recent stock assessment of octopus in Mauritania , the report says '' ... the assessment conducted in 1998 indicates that the stock was over-exploited ... '' and it then goes on to say that '' ... the 1998 working group in Nouadhibou recommended a reduction of 25 % of the fishing effort exerted by the cephalopod fisheries ... '' . #% I welcome the fact that authorisation of an additive will be valid for a maximum of ten years . #% There is no mention of state terrorism . #% Let us ensure that we have consensus in the Council before moving forward . #% Even though I voted in favour , I voted with grave and serious reservations . #% In my final few seconds , let me talk about the committee itself and the procedures under which we work . #% For instance , in 2002 average farm family income on the 40 % of farms classified as full-time was EUR 27 760 . #% If we are serious about achieving the objectives outlined in the Lisbon process then clearly not only do we need to increase our budget at European level , but we must also find ways to ensure that Member States actually address the issues seriously . #% The directive challenges the right of Member States and local authorities to regulate services . #% Finally , I know that the Euratom programme is not part of the EC programme and is not subject to codecision , but I would welcome an assurance from the Commissioner that the Commission will reflect European Parliament concerns in its activities , and in particular our amendments to the Euratom programme . #% It is up to the representatives of those countries themselves to be realistic and not hypocritical , not to play party politics and hide behind doublespeak . #% I find that unacceptable in terms of the democratic accountability of this House . #% While some sort of devolution may in some cases be acceptable or desirable , it must be remembered that fish swim around so management of fisheries must be achieved at an appropriate level . #% Madam President , is there really much point in our debating human rights in these countries unless the EU is prepared to act on the stipulation in its bilateral agreements with Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam that respect for human rights is a condition for the continuance of EU aid ? #% Mr President , I ask your indulgence to invite my colleagues who have not yet signed the declaration on autism to do so . #% I welcome both the European Ombudsman 's report and that of the rapporteur , Mr De Rossa , and congratulate them on their work . #% There are so many things that remain to be done and so many priorities that were set down at Lisbon , Stockholm , or Cardiff that have yet to be completed , to be achieved and to be reached . #% There is no military solution to these problems , only peaceful solutions . #% Regulation has to be maintained by having a strong public service element . #% It is now up to us to be generous in our praise of those countries , to give them genuine encouragement and not lectures on how their systems should operate , to give them our experience with the open method of coordination , under which you look at practices in other countries and take the best of them and try to achieve the best possible result . #% Some did not quite accept what I believe is also a necessary requirement , that in the matter of policy formulation and implementation they carry a general responsibility for their departments , answerable to the college but accountable to this Parliament . #% If consumers wish to purchase food derived from animals which were not fed on GM feed , then they can do so via the organic route . #% The European Union has a responsibility here , and the Member States that are cooperating with the United States on military matters have an obligation to ensure that international treaties are respected . #% However , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission . #% In Ireland , the Celtic Tiger economic boom has resulted in higher-paying , stable occupational opportunities for young professionals . #% Now , Canadian water is a particular target of the water multinationals . #% It is wholly unacceptable to have Chinese Christians in prison for merely expressing their Christian beliefs or distributing copies of the Bible . #% Progress was made on the new European monetary system , the legal status of the Euro , and the Stability and Growth Pact . #% The oral question before us was tabled by my colleague Mr Florenz and we also have a motion for resolution further to that oral question on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on the EU strategy for the Punta del Este Conference on Persistent Organic Pollutants . #% This is an opportunist action on behalf of the Socialist Group to try to create a storm before the conference takes place in London . #% It is not easy to discern the myriad of concerns , some domestic , some European , which gave rise to the `` no '' result in Ireland . #% However , the report has several glaring omissions - more than I can mention , so I will confine myself to the subject of China . #% I therefore anticipate a resounding rejection of the Nice Treaty in the Irish referendum this Summer because of this unwarranted interference and because this is a very bad treaty , as many in this House agree . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Harbour , for the cooperative and pragmatic way in which he has worked on the universal services directive . #% We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant . #% This can be misused so that information which should be available is restricted under the guise of confidentiality . #% As rapporteur he tried to mellow the severity of the proposals in the beef sector . #% We insist on lowering labour taxes as the counterpart of this tax . #% This is exceptionally important if the Union is to remain competitive in the years to come . #% I would like to express , in this my final moment in Parliament , my deep appreciation to Parliament , the Commission and all the institutions , and also to my country for having given me the privilege of having a ringside seat at some of the most momentous political occasions of the last hundred years . #% We urgently need to focus on economic reform , especially in countries with unacceptably high unemployment and abysmal growth rates , in order to deliver on the Lisbon promises and not just come out with the same old Lisbon rhetoric . #% However , in one sense the debate has moved on , because it is now up to the Member States and the debate on the Treaty-ratification process that takes place in the Member States . #% Most samples taken by the agency reflected unpolluted conditions . #% So , Madam President , can we invite the Commission and indeed the Council to express themselves in this House earlier in the week , so that we can treat this properly ? #% The idea of a safe country , the idea that governments can actually claim that certain countries are safe , is quite incredible . #% Member States who are reluctant to do this do not want to face up to the fact that our coasts have to be protected . #% Just as in the hate campaign against gays in Uganda , the homophobic campaign in Lithuania tries to insinuate that gay people pose a threat to children , implying sexual abuse of children . #% 
Whilst the Republic of Madagascar should be entitled to use the proceeds of this agreement as it sees fit , I am pleased to see that the major part - 60 % - of the total remunerative package of ECU 2.28 million is to be used for scientific research , conservation and training and therefore will be of direct benefit to the coastal regions and the people who live there . #% In conclusion , our overriding aim in all of this must be to decide on the policy that best protects our consumers . #% Would it be possible to see , through the presidency , whether this type of coordination will take place and would it be possible for the President-in-Office to come back to Parliament and present a proposed model of the type of integration which would take place , at the same time ensuring that there is no reduction in the commitment towards rural development , but also guaranteeing that all of the funding towards employment creation - which is so important for all of us here in Europe - is not just focused on urban areas . #% Perhaps the Commissioner might outline what those circumstances might be . #% It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here . #% All these experiences , particularly those in recent days , underline how essential it is for the EU to strengthen its foreign policy role , including its defence and military capabilities , so that a proper equilibrium can be established in our transatlantic relationship . #% I also note my disappointment that Fianna Fáil TDs voted against this modest motion on media ownership in Italy . #% It is too small for that , even in the area of Structural Funds , for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP . #% However , I should like to ask my colleagues in the new Member States not to give their national governments the power to decide at central government level how and where the money is to be spent . #% I started my presentation in defence of fishermen . #% I believe that , after Iraq , the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil . #% Our efforts to combat ` brain drain ' and establish a ` brain network ' will be enhanced by proposals which minimise bureaucratic obstacles and increase social security support for researchers . #% I congratulate the rapporteur for his handling of this report through three readings and lengthy negotiations with the Council in the conciliation process . #% So I would agree with that particular section of Amendment No 1 . #% Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts . #% If we are to go along with the presidency 's conclusions then the fifteen employment action plans submitted by the Member States represent a real effort to enhance the employability of young people , the long-term unemployed and women . #% He absconded to the United States where he has decided to stay and has not come back to face the consequences of his action , even despite warrants from Interpol . #% I want to make quite clear my absolute rejection of attempts by the President of Parliament and the Conference of Presidents to set aside this motion on the human rights situation in Western Sahara until after the visit and conclusion of some future EU delegation . #% Without consumer confidence , e-commerce is going nowhere . #% I wish to raise also the discovery of eight people dead in a container of furniture in County Wexford over the weekend . #% Although the Maltese authorities have introduced VAT , much new legislation is still required to bring Maltese law into line with the EU situation . #% Unless practical and feasible changes are made to the control system , fisheries policy will not have the confidence of fishermen and will certainly fail . #% I share the concern of the rapporteur over the fact that seven of the fourteen Essen projects are still facing difficulties because their funding is not totally guaranteed and no timetables have been drawn up for their implementation . #% But instead of going for a scientific safety assessment , the directive is based on an outmoded Recommended Daily Allowance dating back to the Second World War . #% For example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success . #% If they are not practical and people are agreeing to them , then we will be giving hostages to fortune in this regard . #% I agree with the resolution where it says : ' monitoring is a problem ' . #% While subsidiarity dictates that each Member State can decide what kind of research may be carried out within its territory , we must not forget that we are talking about European taxpayers ' money here . #% Mr President , I will send you the details of this proposal and ask you to consider them and to raise this matter with President Uribe when you meet him . #% I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr Dell ` Alba should familiarise himself a little more in detail with these funds . #% We also make our businesses more competitive . #% We have also made additions to the list of high-risk groups to include the young , the elderly , disabled people and women . #% European Investment Bank external lending to developing countries must be focused on investments which contribute to eradicating poverty , and has to turn away from tax haven-based companies . #% It is a new phenomenon to us , but it saddens me to see people that I believed to be decent and compassionate acting in a racist and xenophobic way - and that includes many of the people in my own constituency . #% Energy , however , is not like other goods or services . #% In the context of the forthcoming negotiations on future relations between the European Union and the ACP countries under the Lomé Convention , a stable political system , full respect for human rights , effective participation by society , allied to good government and sound administration , should be recognized as fundamental foundations for sustainable development and the focus of our development policy . #% Look at the last century : the first half of it was marked by the worst conflict the world had ever seen : two world wars and millions of people dead and killed . #% As someone who was in the last Parliament I know how much thankless time and effort they have put in since BSE first began in a very difficult area to try and find a resolution and a way forward to help everyone in a very sensible way . #% Will the Council state specifically that existing nuclear reactors which do not meet standards will be closed ? #% It is also welcome that the Council agreement in Brussels in October 2002 brought stability and predictability to farmer spending up to 2013 . #% He has made a real campaign out of this and a real mission for himself . #% Consultation between the groups , in particular the shadow rapporteurs , has been constructive and positive and I wish to thank my colleagues in other groups for that process . #% The artisanal fisheries contribute over 90 % of fish consumed locally and provide 25 % of export earnings for the fisheries market . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report . #% In April 1994 there were seven major proposals sent from this Parliament , one of the last pieces of legislation passed in this Parliament concerning the lesser-used languages , which were sent both to the Commission and the Council . #% The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes , including the tobacco , and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them . #% It is worth noting that by June 2001 Malta had closed negotiations on over 17 different chapters , including important issues ranging from education and training to telecommunications , fisheries and consumer protection . #% We certainly would hope for the future that we might be able to develop procedures to allow for what might be described as more questioning in depth of nominees . #% Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in complimenting Mrs Anttila for her very objective and balanced presentation . #% Current estimates show that bushmeat is being consumed on a massive scale across the humid tropics , particularly in Africa . #% There may be cause for action elsewhere . #% The provisional application of this protocol will depend on the first payment being made before 31 December this year . #% As he said , tobacco smuggling is a very lucrative business . #% It makes you stop and wonder . #% It could be given the role for the authorisation process for GMOs and genetically modified foods while also maintaining a monitoring brief on genetically modified foods throughout the EU . #% Why not legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources , for example 5 % bio-ethanol mix in petrol , 2 % bio-diesel mix in diesel vehicles , without any alteration necessary to the vehicles ? #% The European Union ' s response to the Balkans , on our very doorstep , was generally viewed as too little , too late . #% It could be the beginning of a race to the bottom in exactly the same way as we have seen in Europe , where the EU Commission itself endorses the rights of private companies providing services to exploit workers , as proven when the Commission took the Luxembourg state to court for wanting migrant service workers to be given the same protection as Luxembourgish workers . #% Local supply and local branding are keys to success . #% They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue . #% The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union . #% The rural economy has evolved over the years and there is now a heavy reliance on environmental projects . #% However , it comes with a health warning . #% The specific instrument for development policy is this instrument ; it will not have any other content . #% In conclusion , while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process , Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward . #% If unanimous agreement on the Constitutional Treaty can not be achieved , then the only alternative is the creation of a two-speed Europe . #% 
There is now a new reason for hastening slowly on enlargement . #% Furthermore , it is a labour-intensive industry and , as such , provides employment for a wide range of people . #% The fact of the matter is that there is public reporting of the results which are carried out by each national standards authority within every Member State of the European Union . #% I believe this to be completely unacceptable as a policy for the European Union or its Member States . #% I conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in Europe but a holy cow . #% My Group voted in favour of the Jackson resolution on Structural Funds in the environment because we believe in the principle of ensuring effective implementation of environmental law - in this case , the wild birds and habitats directive . #% It will help to strengthen new free-market economies of these countries , and it will contribute to making these countries more competitive . #% The Irish presidency should be doing everything in its power to ensure that these people are not denied their basic human rights for a minute longer . #% We agree whole-heartedly with that , and I would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this : in five years ' time will we have exported stability to south-eastern Europe , or will we still be importing the consequences of instability ? #% The European Union has now ensured that the tools of war have been put aside in favour of the development of new policies . #% Without a doubt , should it be our priority to ensure that our people are protected against the dangerous affects of nuclear waste . #% Finally , I believe that Syria , which seeks complete restoration of the Golan Heights , has announced that it is willing to renew peace talks with Israel , but only from where they broke off in 1966 . #% The clear scientific evidence is that climate change is real , is happening now , and will get worse . #% I urge colleagues to support this proposal . #% The overall aim of the report is to raise awareness with regard to health and safety and to prevent unfair competition . #% This is the current situation and has proved reliable in terms of protecting public health . #% Generally we have post-tax prices advertised . #% The President-in-Office said the Council can not share Parliament 's view on the evolution of monetary policy . #% If a Member State does not apply European Union law , it is a matter for the Commission to pursue that matter . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I too would like to join with my colleagues in thanking the President-in-Office and President Barroso for their presentations here today . #% These are extremely serious criminal offences and in making these observations either one produces the evidence or one has the decency to withdraw . #% In conclusion , the very existence of the Cohesion Fund has been of the utmost importance for Ireland . #% I would like to ask if the President-in-Office could give us an undertaking that wider consultation will take place in the future ? #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work . #% in writing . - The Basel Committee seeks to reform the Basel II framework in order to strengthen the resilience of the banking system . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for making statements to us . #% The motion goes on to say ` with or without speaking rights ' . #% Mr President , first of all let me congratulate Mr Moscovici on his country winning Euro 2000 . #% I am not satisfied that the Commissioner has given a full reply to all the questions . #% Commissioner Wallström wrote last March to the Irish Minister of the Environment , Mr Dempsey , suggesting that the large number of Irish environmental complaints currently being dealt with by the EU officials be dealt with in his department or by the Irish Ombudsman . #% I would ask with respect that the Commissioner , in the interests of probity , satisfy herself fully as to the genesis of this regulation in question to ensure the impact of its roll-out on the aviation industry world-wide . #% I warmly welcome this Green Paper as a European debate-launcher on learning disabilities , major depression , suicide , imprisonment of suffers and the affect of inappropriate imprisonment so that Member States can share research and best practice for the benefit of our citizens . #% But it was an important advance . #% However , EU programmes need tighter coordination to ensure that EU Aids initiatives are producing optimal results . #% Burning waste and calling it recovery is stretching the imagination to the extreme . #% I would like to refer to three in particular . #% Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission for the contributions they have made here today . #% It is our responsibility therefore to ensure that the wishes , not just of Parliament but also of the candidate countries who had travelled here and of the Member State representatives who came , concerning the position on the family are accurately presented , otherwise our time has been wasted . #% I am very glad to hear the Commission 's reply because the funding that Coillte has was set up by the state , it was the state that set Coillte up . #% The President-in-Office spoke very passionately this morning about her concerns but , as Mr De Rossa has rightly pointed out , these concerns were no surprise to a great many of us . #% The United States Government has more than doubled the level of subsidies per farmer . #% A simplified single Treaty will make the EU of 25 more intelligible to the citizens of Europe by defining the EU and Member States ' competences clearly . #% The Irish people must show some compassion on this issue . #% I would like to ask the Commissioner if he will implement an effective promotional campaign in relation to beef and also a factual , credible information campaign for consumers ? #% I would like to ask the Council to comment on the fact that a growing number of Member States have expressed serious concern regarding the success of the regime , and that the Commission 's recent statement that there is unanimous agreement that the current legislation ` provides a clear , simple and easily enforceable solution ' is totally misleading . #% However , as in many other areas , the reason that contracts have been awarded to countries like Korea is surely because of the conditions that apply : for example workers in such countries get very low wages , working conditions and safety measures are very poor and unsatisfactory , because the health and safety of workers is not a priority . #% The publishing industry is both unhappy and bemused , to say the least , and this is not how we promote the European Union nor how things work in the Member States . #% Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December , not next June . #% I would like you to give us the real reason for this delay and also to bear in mind that in Madrid in 1995 it was decided that negotiations would start with Malta six months after the end of the IGC . #% It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals , because jobs are then created within the EU . #% Also , the basis on which we make resources available particularly to the poorer regions is not always very clear , either to ourselves who proposed the regulations or to the Member States who have the responsibility of interpreting them . #% First of all , may I take the opportunity of congratulating the rapporteur . #% In conclusion , Mr President , for the record , Ireland has never been neutral nor could we afford to be . #% The involvement of the social partners in this whole area is vital because , unless we can get broad agreement between the unions , employers and other social partners , then the essential elements involved in the whole area of employment and training will not be willing to come together to find solutions . #% Mr President , it will come as no surprise that my main plea today is for the Council to make the effort to meet its timetable to enable Parliament to fully exercise its democratic mandate and add democratic legitimacy . #% I am very proud of what you have achieved and you should rightly be proud of a job very well done . #% I should like to point out to the Commissioner that he meddles in the tax affairs of Member States at his peril . #% Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq , among other things , to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees . #% The UN and the EU must act . #% Let me be clear : we need better controls there as well . #% From an environmental point of view it is more important to optimise collection and recycling in the Community as a whole , rather than to consider whether this takes place in a particular Member State . #% Thanks also to the Commission . #% in writing . - It is with great pleasure that I have voted in favour of naming 2011 as the European Year of Volunteering . #% I am glad that a clear distinction has now been made between nuclear safeguards and nuclear safety and security . #% The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable . #% We would not accept that from this Parliament or from any national parliament ; the Council should not be allowed to get away with it . #% 
The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming . #% However , let me sound a note of caution in relation to the efforts inherent in this Commission proposal to base this measure on Article 95 of the Treaty . #% The Commissioner has also already indicated that she has requested the UK authorities to indicate whether or not they believe they are still in compliance with EU laws . #% In the two concrete cases that I am aware of , Mallow and Carlow sugar plants in Ireland , this balance is not apparent . #% Quite frankly , I do not think they believed it up to that point . #% This report recognises that the challenges we face can not be addressed by reheated dogmas , whether of the left or the right . #% However , on this occasion , the politicians got it wrong . #% It is a recipe for defeat for the outcome of the IGC , but it is also a recipe for the defeat of Europe . #% Mr President , at exactly this time last year you will recall that there was worldwide condemnation of the French nuclear tests and this Parliament told President Chirac in no uncertain terms here in this hemicycle what we thought of his government 's actions . #% We must ensure that animals are not subjected to unnecessary suffering , and this is clearly unnecessary . #% There is something seriously wrong here . #% I believe that the Commission is acting to subvert the will of parliament in imposing such conditions on the grant and consequently , I proposed including a direct reference to the secretariats in Dublin and Brussels in the footnote . #% We also need conventions for those areas to protect them . #% I am sure that implication was not intended . #% Authorities in some countries , including my own , are already planning to close down a number of landfill sites over the next two years . #% I do so because of our experience in Ireland and what happened to Irish workers and the mostly foreign workers who replaced them in Irish ferries . #% In the case of Ireland , for example , asset inflation , the price index for houses , went up 1.5 % in February . #% If the European Union , in a democratic process , decides that own resources are simply a straight percentage of GDP collected by the Member States and passed over in a lump sum , that is fair enough : that is what own resources are and that is democratic . #% The success of the European project rests on tolerance of diversity and difference and , if necessary , agreeing to disagree . #% Irish fishermen have faced hard times before but now they no longer have the control to work through their troubles . #% I note in recital E of this resolution that we Europeans give ourselves a nice pat on the back for our humanitarian aid efforts . #% Every step of the industry 's chain of production is regulated , ` from farm to fork ' so to speak . #% However , in practice Sunday is the only day of the week when the majority of people in our society are not in the workplace or at school or otherwise occupied . #% I am glad to say , the Labour commissioner , Bruce Millan , spotted this and was very clear about the fact that these areas could not possibly qualify for European Objective 2 under economic social cohesion need areas . #% Good luck , Commissioner , when you go to Luxembourg . #% Fundamental reform of the CAP at this stage is neither necessary nor desirable . #% Cash flow is also a problem for new industries . #% I would ask the Commissioner to make sure that , in her work as the lead Commissioner on this subject , she forms a team with Commissioner Papoutsis , Commissioner Kinnock and Commissioner Fischler , the Commissioners most closely concerned . #% The establishment of a single currency in less than two years ' time is now firmly on course ; the stability and growth pact ensures that the financial markets , investors and the general public can all be confident that the Euro will be a stable currency and will not be subject to fluctuations because of short-term policies being pursued by one or more governments within the new currency zone . #% Confronting these problems will require a radical reform of Member States ' laws to protect our children more effectively . #% Any proposal that she would put before this House would have my full support and confidence because I trust entirely her integrity in these matters . #% Our debate should focus not on argument about timetables , but on the reduction of the overall level of packaging and packaging waste through recycling and recovery . #% The average citizen must be aware of what work is being carried on when we get near to the frontiers of what is acceptable and in some cases beyond those frontiers . #% I am extremely disappointed that the Council , in this way , would want to wash its hands of what is a very serious matter . #% If at any time the discards exceed part of that closure , then the fishermen will quite readily accept . #% I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development . #% In our desire to help the environment , whilst at the same time reducing our dependence on imported fuels , we could use new energy crops to run all of our public transport in the European Union , if we so wished . #% Could I suggest that it is important that we do not reduce the Constitution to its detail , that we do not damn it with faint praise by suggesting that it is just a tidying up exercise , because the spirit of the Constitution is greater than the sum of its parts . #% Terrorists do not respect human life , they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights . #% The likely accession of these countries will provide all Europe with a unique opportunity to work together for a peaceful and secure future . #% Secondly , the Council can further accept our suggested 55 months for the review of the recommendation . #% The risk of nuclear proliferation is greater during transportation than at any other stage in the fuel cycle . #% This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States , whether they are participant countries or not . #% I encourage the EU Member States on the UN Security Council to take a more proactive role in getting Burma on to the Security Council agenda , in particular Britain . #% Instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions . #% Furthermore , what will be done about the bottom trawlers that make up the vast majority of the current European fleet and are at risk of being wiped out by the current emergency package which has been proposed ? #% I very much welcome the initiative that Minister Quinn took , although not with successful results . #% Would a shorter period be more beneficial to allow for an earlier review and to take into account developments arising from enlargement ? #% Madam President , our committee covers 120 budget lines , some very large indeed , including the research programmes Tacis , Phare and Meda . #% I believe that is now possible . #% The last point that I would make is that we should avoid using the -- Article 42 . #% The Italian Government is not respecting those norms by any measure , and I would urge the Commission to insist that the Italian Government -- and indeed any other Member State , if it is in breach of these norms -- be hauled before the European Court of Justice to ensure that these laws are respected . #% These new countries join with the original six that are already engaged in extensive talks with the Union covering 38 different chapters of negotiations concerning the enlargement process . #% I am beginning to think that Roger and those of his political party are feeling a little bit that way since last weekend . #% It is vitally important that the European institutions , as well as national governments , undertake a comprehensive process of education amongst all sectors of the population and not just amongst the financial and business community , as seems to be mainly the case at present . #% Finally , I wish to say to the Commission that I understand what it is trying to do but , until the beef market has time to recover from the recent crisis , it is absolutely necessary to ease the very severe proposals so that farmers can stay in business . #% I fully understand and believe that this is not going to be an easy task , but we must not underestimate the challenges that lie before us . #% Are we going to use this handbook , or are we going to use similar measures , to ensure that the reconstruction effort in Haiti is professionally carried out ? #% Let me recall one of the results of these inquiries : in the past five years the average delay in the disbursement of committed funds has increased from three years to four-and-a-half years . #% In fact I would go further and say that the EU Convention runs the risk of blurring the enlargement process . #% It is essential that SMEs are given as much support as possible to play their part in the economic recovery , yet what do they currently face ? #% I am very happy indeed that Mr Schnellhardt has said , on behalf of my group , that we will be supporting Mr Pimenta 's report . #% . I have voted today against the Junker report which calls on the European Union and its Member states to integrate sexual and reproductive health and rights into their development policies . #% Mr President , I would like to warmly congratulate all who have been involved in the hard work of bringing these reports to a coherent , positive and even strong conclusion . #% That is what I support . #% Mr President , Taiwan is a sovereign nation and its people have worked hard to become a major economic player in Asia . #% 
In the past three years I have not been on a plane that left on time or arrived on time . #% I would appeal to Commissioner Wallström to address that issue and to raise the matter with the college of Commissioners . #% Today we , the European Parliament drawn from 25 Member States , add our voice to that of the Irish Government , the British Government and the United States Congress , in support of the McCartney campaign for justice . #% The ordinary Members of Parliament , the elected Members , do not have a say on this and this is very regrettable . #% I support the provisions of Article 16 wholeheartedly ... #% Farming is perhaps the industry in the most precarious position in the European Union at present . #% The influx of Bhutanese refugees into Nepal began in late 1991 and the fear of diminishing international attention , therefore , is always present . #% Surely imposing a European directive and a Europe-wide legislation will seriously impact on these areas , as Members have already admitted there is a cost factor built into this : costs that will be passed on directly to the consumer and costs that will affect our industrial capacity as well as affecting our competitive edge . #% I just want to agree with what my colleague Mr Fitzsimons says . #% Maybe we asked for some initiatives but , on reflection , we would say that they are not such a priority after all . #% Madam President , I am very happy to participate at short notice in this debate and to recognize the contribution that Mr Colom i Naval has made by bringing up this particular report , by his contribution at the level of the committee where he analysed very thoroughly what the problem is and proposed sensible solutions , and to thank him for his contribution here this morning . #% The tragedy of people cut up in civil wars , which is the main focus obviously of Mr Wiebenga 's report , is only one of the issues we are facing . #% Let us really look at what is happening in the European Union at the present time . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Swedish presidency on being very successful . #% If this is the public perception I think it is outrageous . #% Again , I thank both Commissioners for their presentation . #% Moreover , Turkey 's duplicity over Cyprus makes it unworthy of membership . #% As you know yourself , with regard to your own country , peripheral areas and islands suffer unique disadvantages and hazards that must be responded to in a common and complex way . #% The Commission only adopted the proposals in May 2003 , and therefore we can not realistically expect the first grants to be available before late summer 2004 . #% I say to him to leave such archaic nonsense to Sinn Féin , from whom one expects no better . #% Yesterday I sought advice from the House after a lengthy exchange of views and then , not following a vote but under the prerogatives of the Presidency , I made a ruling . #% I therefore welcome the rapporteur 's calls for the improved management of resources , stabilization of incomes , measures to compensate for income losses and the creation of ` SEA LEADER ' programmes . #% It is up to the Commission to propose it in time . #% Human embryos should not be created for research purposes , but this has indeed already happened in the US this summer . #% I hope , over the next few months , that we will have an opportunity to impress upon our colleagues in Parliament and ministers in the various Member States the importance to us . #% The claim is that the Commission wants there to be a balanced approach in dealing with ethanol-producing countries . #% A further shocking waste of resources , Commissioner , is that women in technical , scientific and information technology fields are squandering their skills . #% It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly . #% Whatever may be the policy of this Union in regard to an open market economy , those people who want to buy home-produced meat should be given the right to know it is home-produced . #% However , a European driver 's licence should be available , like the old international licence , for those who drive in other countries of the Union for more than just a brief holiday . #% Let me remind the Commission that Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1275/94 specifically recognised the biological sensitivity of the Irish Box , and yet the Commission broke this important link . #% I want to congratulate the British presidency . #% The depletion of oil stocks means that fertilisers , pesticides and machinery will all be affected in due course and , by extension , agriculture will be affected and will have to adapt . #% Obviously forestry will become very important commercially in Ireland but there is resistance from a social standpoint to replacement of the small farms on the marginal land by tracts of woodland . #% My final point is that I do not support - and I made this point previously - genetic engineering as it applies to humans . #% Sadly , there are many parts of the world today that are not self-sufficient , and we who have developed the techniques must share our technologies and our experiences with developing countries . #% I very much welcome the decision of the Irish Government , which last night established a national forum on Europe . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Mr President , I am sure the House would like to remember the missing UN and EU staff and all of those who are missing and suffering in Haiti at this time . #% We have only one alternative to offer them , namely fish farming . #% The Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 is such an opportunity for my region . #% I must say that I disagree fundamentally with Mr Crowley . #% Your approach has been a breath of fresh air and will , I hope , reassure the candidate countries that we are indeed serious about this issue and have demonstrated as much during the Swedish presidency . #% in writing . - The EU-US relationship is one of the most important relationships that the EU has . #% I hope , Mr President , that you will send a message on behalf of this House and join with the European Council in congratulating Pope John-Paul and wishing him well as he continues his work for peace throughout the world . #% It seems that profit comes before the interests of the public and the environment . #% This presidency is being entrusted with two very difficult chapters in the negotiations on enlargement , namely agricultural policy and regional aid . #% I am confident that both sides can reach agreement on these chapters of the talks and reach a conclusion that is - and must be - fair and balanced . #% A recent survey has suggested that child smoking in Germany alone has increased by up to 50 % . #% This resulted in the massacre of 800 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps . #% The Irish presidency has intensified the level of discussions on securing broader international support for the implementation of the Kyoto Accord . #% Mr President , I come to this debate with divided loyalties . #% I apologise most profusely for that . #% Commissioner , we were very surprised to discover that you , a Commissioner with special responsibility for relations with Parliament , briefed the press in September before Parliament had even heard of these proposals . #% This should not be allowed . #% Finally , I strongly support the call by Mr Pasty for a decent and fair amount of time to discuss these extremely important proposals that have been put forward by President Santer on behalf of the Commission . #% If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe . #% We must ensure that , in regulating food marketing , we do not kill off the remaining traditional local farmers ' markets . #% We have 3,000 non-consultant hospital doctors , or junior doctors . #% Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year , approximately 200 000 died in wars . #% Certainly from an Irish perspective , the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996 has proved to be very successful in tackling this area of crime . #% If we do not apply household or domestic water charges by then we will have to explain our action to the Commission . #% There were several snags which should have been thought about , but were not . #% The report highlights the need for further studies on discard and its biological , marine and economic consequences . #% As many colleagues will be aware , the Commission is attempting to impose conditions on the Bureau which would have the effect of closing its office in Dublin . #% It is no good carrying out studies which we are not going to follow up . #% It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from 7 % to 13.5 % and asks that the ECB evaluate this . #% 
We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia , which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC . #% However , we must all work to ensure that air accidents are reduced to a bare minimum . #% At the same time , the CAP budget must help European farmers adapt to new challenges and opportunities . #% The resolution we are going to vote on this week will provide the guiding line for upcoming negotiations on the next-generation development instrument . #% The proposal from the Committee diminished the safeguards in the original Commission proposal by allowing the funding of research on so-called supernumerary embryos , with no prohibition on funding activities which would be contrary to the Oviedo Convention ( i.e. cloning for research and germ-line intervention ) . #% The European Union itself , as I have said before - given that it is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution - might begin by creating a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation , backed up by a department of peace and reconciliation , which could be sent to areas of conflict with the principles of conflict resolution that are the heart of the European Union . #% That is not how political persuasion operates . #% in writing . - The Ombudsman offers an important service to Irish citizens . #% I am convinced that the difficult political problems in Iraq can only be effectively addressed in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations . #% This is what blights the life of all minorities and conquered peoples within the territory that China now claims to rule . #% I now believe that the Irish presidency must give priority to persuading Member States to agree on a funding package for the trans-European networks to ensure that they are put in place as quickly as possible . #% I very much support the goal of the European Commission that half of all Internet connections must be by broadband facility by the year 2005 within the European Union . #% Like many other countries -- Côte d’Ivoire , Uzbekistan and Chechnya , etc. -- East Timor has been exploited by bigger powers . #% There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole . #% Two million jobs were created in 2006 and unemployment fell from 8.4 % to 7.6 % . #% We have a binding commitment to provide 1 % of our annual gross national product to meet our future public pension bills . #% Lastly , we could do what we are recommending to Parliament - accept on the grounds that no further money is forthcoming , to be realistic , but that some concessions have been made to our priorities . #% Forty years later , the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals : to bring people around to this way of thinking . #% We had to cancel it , even though you had earlier said that you would attend . #% It is only one of many directives covered by this package of laws that we are putting through today and , as chair of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , I therefore want to ask you to address some of the key future issues to enhance consumer confidence and to ensure consumer safety and awareness . #% In my own constituency , Crumlin United Football Club -- a club for young people , where Robbie Keane came from -- each year holds a sports festival weekend where people not only play sport but also have cultural exchanges . #% It gives exclusive prominence to the freedom to provide services across borders , whereas freedoms such as social rights and collective bargaining are excluded or dismantled . #% They must also obviously be allowed fair access to the media . #% I think that we have to begin to toughen up on the need to apply sanctions or suspend agreements if we are going to make progress in this area . #% There is a strong correlation between research effort and economic success , and the European Union at least is giving an example and showing that it understands that connection . #% Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to wish the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Spring , every success in the course of the Irish presidency agus go n'eirí an bóthar leat sa post atá romhat amach anseo . #% In particular I want to focus on Hungary . #% It is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement . #% If we take the right decisions now , we can ensure that the European Union economy grows and prospers in the future . #% We must favour creating a proper business environment where employment can be created , and where proper and real jobs can be maintained within the European Union . #% One thing is very clear : the new European monetary area , though it is wholly open to trade , will have a very different degree of openness to the separate Member State economies . #% These have not been accepted by the Council . #% In conclusion , we share the vision expressed here today . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report . #% I am also especially supportive of references in this common position compromise which identify marine sciences and technologies as a cross-cutting scientific priority . #% Natural habitats were destroyed . #% Mr President , I warmly endorse this report and I would like in particular to speak on the issue of Turkey , given the recent unfortunate remarks by Mr Giscard d'Estaing . #% the promotion of cooperation between security and intelligence services and police , judicial and customs authorities of the Member States and third countries , raising the issue of data protection and constituting a deterioration of civil liberties and respect for human rights ; #% Consumers are also increasingly tempted to buy even more expensive items across borders , like washing machines , fridges , financial services and cars . #% I know that the rapporteur has endeavoured to be realistic with his target of 15 % . #% Liberalisation of gas and electricity is certainly part of the Lisbon Process , but this does not mean a free-for-all in the electricity and gas markets . #% This is inadequate ! #% It is also my firm belief that something must be done to rid the Union of its red-tape image amongst the people of Europe . #% Lord Inglewood of BNFL recently indicated that he would certainly take on board the concerns I expressed to him on this subject , in the same way that the concerns of the Austrians in relation to Temelin have been structured by the Commission . #% European taxpayers ' money was given to the Bord Iascaigh Mhara to do this research . #% Given that the American authorities have conceded that it was a failure on the part of their security agencies rather than airport technology which led to the recent Detroit terrorist scare , I believe that , before we invest in this controversial technology , a variety of less expensive methods - such as increased intelligence , different search methods and enhanced international cooperation - should be explored . #% The only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place measures which some people may feel discriminate against men . #% I would also ask that the Commission take note of the fact that the European people would welcome Mr Mobutu as much as they would the greatest criminal . #% Amendment No 3 , which dealt with the legal concept of habeas corpus , had been circulated to us in the Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group . #% As the Commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities . #% Direct financial aid and the transfer of technology and expertise to developing countries are the hallmarks of the European Union 's development policy . #% I sent a letter to President Barroso - signed by a number of MEPs - and he replied that the Commission have moved quickly to authorise three modified GM products , and a fourth on the way . #% I take a dim view of the attempt by Mr Watson , the leader of the Liberal Group , to demean the motives of myself and my colleagues in travelling to Baghdad this weekend to try to persuade whatever authorities we have the opportunity to meet there to cooperate actively with the inspectors and , indeed , to see first-hand the impact which sanctions are having , particularly on the children of Iraq . #% I welcome what Mr Cox has said on the different matters he mentioned . #% It must be fair in order to ensure we give priority to our poor regions without abandoning those problem regions going through the process of economic and social restructuring in wealthier Member States . #% Madam President , as rapporteur for the general regulation on the reform of the structural funds I voted against the PPE resolution and the compromise resolution . #% We are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference . #% In the UK , for example , during the World Cup football matches , 30 % of those making online bets on UK services were women . #% If we are serious about protecting the European model of agriculture , with all its constraints and additional costs , and if we are serious about maintaining the rural countryside we must return to prices which are in some way based on , or linked to , the cost of production . #% Mr President , this was the first time I had taken part in one of these delegations . #% In fact , I am sure you can appreciate that the current government is spending more time rearranging the deck-chairs on the Titanic than developing innovative approaches to employment . #% While coal and the mining of it contribute hugely to pollution , in some countries , they also provide huge employment . #% Unfortunately , the amendment to preserve the opt-out clause was defeated and thus the rest of Europe is lining up to foist upon us a Working Time Directive which is largely unsupported within the United Kingdom . #% It could lead to hysteria if people do not understand exactly what it means . #% Mr President , I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say . #% A recent meeting with astronauts made me more aware of the potential for science in Europe if we take the messages of the Lisbon declaration seriously . #% 
Mr President , in this debate on terrorism I welcome the fact that last Saturday morning , in Belfast , an IRA member , Terry Davison , was charged in court with the murder of Robert McCartney and that a second IRA person , Jim McCormick , was charged with the attempted murder of Mr McCartney 's friend , Brendan Devine . #% What I think happened was that the Commission just kept its head down and hoped that it would all disappear ; that it was a flash in the pan and that nobody would take it terribly seriously and nothing would have to do be done about it . #% While I support the precautionary principle , I do not support a ` preventionary ' principle . #% `` The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful ; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries '' . #% With its harmonization of the tax system , the EU is gradually assuming all the characteristics of a single state . #% John Cushnahan and I have published a seven-point initiative on measures , which could help to clarify the issues and to assuage fears in Ireland . #% Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy , tell me this morning - because you have not done so yet - about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the Irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the Irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them . #% I would also like to state , and strongly reinforce , the difficulty that we have in the European Union on arriving at an energy policy within a proper legal base , without a proper legal base in the Treaty on European Union . #% It was also accepted that enlargement would not be achieved without some cost and that a contribution would be required from all Member States in proportion to their ability to contribute . #% The devastation caused by the earthquake is hard to comprehend , even after seeing repeated pictures of the suffering on our media screens and newspapers . #% The visible projects that I see in my constituency , such as the computer training suite that I launched yesterday , is the human and proactive side of European Union policies . #% Truly a war of civilisations . #% I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission . #% The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecast world sugar consumption at 145 million tonnes for 2004 and 2005 , with production at 143 million tonnes . #% Commissioner , could you please tell us how quickly we will be able to resolve this issue of different eligibility criteria for different benefits ? #% In fact , according to information available from studies carried out by the Irish road hauliers ' association it would increase the number of vehicles on the road and would neither reduce congestion nor lessen environmental damage . #% The euro currency is already an international reserve and a transaction currency . #% In the grey economic space , the budget was inflationary , but , on the supply side , the tax change will bring greater participation in a stretched labour force . #% I was delighted that Commissioner Patten was here yesterday because his is a role that we must respect and support as well . #% He is asking for flanking measures to ensure EMU and cohesion come together and we are asking also for a solidarity mechanism to protect the financial markets against speculation and to include countries wishing to come in . #% Let us solve the first problem before we do any such thing . #% In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices . #% There were three adults found dead also - two men and a woman - and there are five survivors . #% The issue of the arms embargo to China is also one of major concern to those worried about the arms trade . #% This is a big gap and we must continue to put pressure on Member States if we want a coherent policy . #% For that reason , it is our privilege here to raise our voices to demand that his life and the lives of those living in his community are protected and to make sure that the Colombian Government is aware of our concerns . #% In conclusion , I should like to say that satisfactory results in relation to this issue depend to a large extent on the use of safe and good quality feedingstuffs . #% We have to ensure that we have a proposal that will encourage others into this industry and bring greater competition . #% We must look at these figures and put them into context , and it is important for our response to be reasoned and proportionate to the risks and dangers that actually exist . #% It is totally inappropriate for the European Union to engage in this form of cooperation with Israel while that state continues to blatantly ignore international law and abuse the human rights of the Palestinian people . #% We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity . #% Madam President , at the outset we must view this week as a new beginning for all the key institutions within the European Union as to how they intend to interact and work together on various policy programmes over the next five years . #% I have one further question of the Commission . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Commissioner , many of my constituents are babies and very young children , and tonight I would like to speak on their behalf , especially as there are many very good speakers tonight who can speak effectively for women in the workplace . #% I would ask what does `` urgent '' mean in this context ? #% One of the important points to emerge from the research was that , with the exception of Ireland , the elderly have the highest suicide rates in the population . #% Mr President , you will recall that during our last part-session in Strasbourg I raised the plight of the three hostages who were being held in Afghanistan . #% The entry into force of this directive is therefore postponed and Member States can postpone compliance with Article 9 until 2006 . #% What we need is both a marketing sales ban and a testing ban and we must do that now . #% EURES job offers went from 43 000 at the start of 1998 to 166 000 at the beginning of 2000 . #% The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people 's health if something goes wrong . #% Some Member States have agreed a text on the Constitution for the future of Europe and it is ultimately up to them to deliver on their agreement , to make sure they convince their people . #% Mr President , I would like to inform this House that today at 13.00 hours GMT India made an underground thermonuclear test similar to the one that she conducted in 1974 . #% The fact that insurance companies in the UK , Belgium and Germany are not competing in the Irish market was due , I felt , to a failure of the European Union to enforce the right of establishment and the right to equal access to the market . #% I object strongly , as I am sure do many Irish people and colleagues here , to Ireland initiating diplomatic relations with a military dictatorship that controls the Burmese against the will of its people . #% Mr President , I welcome the report by my colleague Mr McCartin , which deals with many of the problems of the fishing industry . #% I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism . #% In particular , the European Union shall adopt measures setting out the highest standards for the quality and safety of organs and substances of human origin , blood and blood derivatives . #% Those accession states themselves have contacted many of us and the leaders of many groups about the added difficulties this report is causing . #% I thank her for clarifying it . #% I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account . #% It is notable that although both argue for alternative agricultural activity , both rapporteurs conclude that there has been no evaluation by the Commission . #% First is climate change , with the possibility of rising sea levels , and in Ireland , increased rainfall . #% This is quite appalling because it represents a failure to recognize that European fleets are far too large and need to be reduced . #% So some progress has been made in that regard . #% That is something I would not want to happen . #% The European Union 's annual contribution constitutes 35 % of the total . #% If I am a cripple in Ireland , I am a cripple in Europe . #% Is the European Union going to stand by and allow China to become the trading partner of the developing world within a generation ? #% I would like the services and , indeed , Parliament to look at this because environmental certification of all projects is not possible , is not in line with the regulations and contravenes the memorandum of understanding between Parliament and the Commission as well as being , of course , against the principle of subsidiarity . #% According to the report , the two projects I have just named provide good examples of projects built to meet local needs . #% It must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios . #% A number of those colleagues , who are sitting on the far side of this House , are a credit to Ireland and their to department for all the work they have done on this . #% We should make this as uncomplicated as possible for the people of the candidate countries . #% It is all very well to have human rights agreements signed , but the reality is that no matter what efforts have been made in Algeria over the years by the Council and by the European Union , the situation , like in Turkey , has got worse instead of better . #% There are still people harking back to the days when , as an Irish poet said : `` every rood of ground maintained its man '' . #% 
Then the fishermen of Greenland , Ireland and perhaps the Azores as well , began to see what might have been . #% In 1962 they owed $ 3 billion , whereas it is now in the region of $ 235 billion - equivalent to 76 % of GNP . #% While education remains a national competence , it is important that the EU give whatever support possible to educators and students , particularly in areas where new and innovative courses and qualifications are needed . #% Our government regulations were introduced in 1999 to counter this trend , which has been cited repeatedly since the 1980s as the main problem in Irish freshwaters . #% Mr President , this is the International Year of Mountains , and I am glad that Mrs Frassoni , our co-Chairman , managed to have this put on the agenda , as it is an essential issue . #% If you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes . #% I would remind her that in the 170 years of monetary union with Britain we made less progress than in the 17 years of monetary agreement with the countries of the European Union . #% I am not going to repeat all Green objections - you have heard them before . #% In the dire situation of North Korea , we are being given an opportunity to make amends for the terrible wrong done to Poland 's prisoners . #% Rather than taking up any more time , I would like to say that I will be voting against the reports tomorrow and I hope that through conciliation we can reach a more reasonable suggestion . #% We must respect differences in climate and soil type . #% This should not just be a business trip that he is engaged in now ; business development and human rights must go hand in hand . #% There will also be continued national support for local job creation programmes under the principle of subsidiarity . #% I refer to Article 109m of the Maastricht Treaty which provides that the management of exchange rates must be done in the common interest . #% The group which I am part of in the European Parliament , the S&D , wholly endorses the ` Active and Healthy Ageing ' pilot European Innovation Partnership and puts forward suggestions for two additional partnerships in the areas which would benefit urgently from the created value added . #% While I welcome the debate - I welcome both sides of the debate taking place in this House - I say to the Greens that I am very disappointed at the type of amendments they have put down in the House supporting the regulation and free distribution of drugs . #% At the same time , margins have been squeezed for fishermen . #% I see my vote today as a support for not only maintaining existing water-borne freight traffic , but also for moving it from road to water . #% Parliament also has to insist that the Council and Commission must do more than just send recommendations : they have to state clearly that the Colombian government puts into danger the relations between the EU and Colombia . #% In the discharge procedure we expect to make a political decision on the performance of the Commission . #% This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome , value and appreciate . #% It says that the European Union , together with the Western European Union will jointly consider future requirements in strengthening mutual cooperation within one year following the entry into force of that Treaty , in order to give the WEU , ' as an integral part of the development of the Union ' , an organizational framework . #% We took the trouble to get an internal consensus in our group - it is a group position - and it is the position of the left in this House ; whereas Amendment No 5 ( paragraph 18 ) by Mr Arias Cañete is simply a personal amendment , supported by 29 signatures , and he does not have the backing of his own political group . #% It is also a fact that the so-called IRA is the most active and politically driven perpetrator of violence and intimidation in Northern Ireland , that it engages in widespread criminality in Northern Ireland , in the Republic of Ireland and also in Britain and does so to enforce its rule of law and to fund its activities . #% The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies , rather the EU 's competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies . #% Secondly , I want to dissociate myself from any eulogy to so-called President Arafat . #% Commissioner Byrne and his officials deserve great credit for their untiring efforts in this respect . #% A final comment : I could not sit down without mentioning our deep concern about Chechnya . #% For example , Ireland has one of the fairest electoral systems in the whole of the European Community . #% They can not be allowed to get away with treating passengers like this any longer . #% Another problem is the lack of knowledge of the procedures among some lawyers and judges who only deal very rarely with these cases . #% It is the position of my group that we accept and promote the parallelism and the strong complementarity between a Members ' Statute and reform of the travel allowances . #% I would like to thank the President-in-Office . #% It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important . #% If the Union had had the job of policing the catching of fish , we might have had some success . #% We have to spell out very clearly what it is and , to put it at its simplest , it is there to strengthen the Union 's policies and the effectiveness of its institutions . #% We simply wanted to ensure that premiums were paid on sheep and goats that actually existed and that we had a means of ensuring that the animals could be counted and accounted for . #% One of the few criticisms I have of this excellent report is that the Commission has not dealt with EMU in a very effective way . #% We have to try a lot harder at European Union level if we are to convince everybody . #% Northern Ireland is an Objective 1 area but this will possibly come to an end . #% Did he get patients off a two-year waiting list for minor operations ? #% To speak of justice in that country is to speak the language of torture and of systematic brutality . #% With regard to a sense of Europe as Hans-Gert Poettering mentioned earlier , I believe it has been diminished at the highest level through Members of the European Council . #% Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their work and also the draftsmen from the various committees for their assistance on what is a very difficult area to legislate on . #% I agree with his observation that while the human rights dialogue could indeed be useful , unfortunately up to now it has not produced tangible results . #% The European Union space policy , for example , is heavily oriented towards security and defence applications such as signals . #% That is not to say that the Irish people do not have clear concerns which they want addressed before any further referendum on the Treaty of Nice . #% But there have been difficulties for many in Ireland , as the Ryanair dispute earlier this year clearly showed . #% The European Union is right to be active in contributing to the institutional and economic rebuilding that is presently taking place within the former Republic of Yugoslavia . #% I am glad to be able to tell you the person tested negative . #% However , if it provides for more transparency and accountability for the wider citizens of the European Union , then it is a positive development . #% Mr President , like many EU harmonising proposals , this report has , at first glance , a certain plausible appeal . #% There is no doubt that in areas such as openness , transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people , the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective . #% Apart from the seriously upsetting and devastating consequences of BSE , which I believe will be overcome , the real problem for young people who in normal circumstances would take up farming as a career is the availability , welcome though it is , of alternative and certainly more financially rewarding employment . #% I note with some surprise that the Republic of Ireland , although a long-established EU Member State , has also been permitted to defer full compliance until the beginning of 2012 . #% I would like to thank my colleagues , Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Poignant for all their hard work on these sister ( or in this case brother ) reports and in drawing up sensible conclusions for improved safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries servicing European ports and domestic voyages within Member States . #% What has happened to those people ? #% Organic crops and products continue to grow in importance as a proportion of our production and every effort must be given to assist the sector . #% This court , which is being opposed by the USA Government would guarantee a fair trial and would apply even-handedly to everyone . #% If it was not the weather , it was quotas or bad prices . #% I was at another meeting at the Winston Churchill Building and by the time I got back here , the question had lapsed . #% I come from an island nation with a high dependence on air transport and improved efficiency in these transport models is extremely important to enable future economic development to take place in my country . #% There is a huge divergence of opinion just on that point alone . #% We must continue to invest in ensuring that we have an economically viable European agricultural system . #% Tonight I want to make it clear that the principal aims of this regulation -- to cut our emissions of fluorinated gases -- should be respected and adhered to in the fullest sense . #% I commend this report to the House and would ask that it should not just be an expression of good intentions or the conscience of the Members of this House or of the Commission , but lead to real action before 2003 , so that then when we celebrate the European Year for the Disabled Citizen , we can actually say that we have made progress and moved beyond some of the barriers . #% 
Are we seeing history repeat itself ? #% No subject has been spoken about more often in this Parliament by those who are talking for the unemployed of Europe than this particular issue . #% Some measures , such as the thermal insulation of new buildings , are indeed already provided for under the same programme . #% I am angry at the arrogance and the hubris of the UK and the US in launching this war . #% I note that the President-in-Office has referred to the discussions which she hopes will come to a fruitful and successful conclusion . #% Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region . #% Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers . #% Madam President , when we discussed this last week in the Conference of Presidents , my group - the Liberal Democrats - voted to have a debate today and not to postpone it . #% It is disappointing , of course , that we have not succeeded in stabilising the number of people living in rural areas . #% In this case , as in so many other policy areas , the EU has touched in a positive way on every aspect of the lives of our citizens . #% First of all I would like to thank my colleague for her response to my letter about the Parliament magazine and to say that the article was in fact subsequently printed in full : I am satisfied with that . #% Mr President , the funding of destructive embryo research is against the constitutional position of Ireland , as it is against the constitutional , legal or political position of four other Member States . #% There have been 17 000 children born in those camps over the last ten years . #% I do not need to remind the President-in-Office of how essential it is to meet the timetable , not only to secure the necessary democratic legitimacy for the Agenda 2000 package but also to allow programmes and policies to be implemented in a timely and effective manner . #% Since the tragic killing of Robert McCartney , I am concerned that politicians have pushed their own electoral agenda in the context of the recent elections and have lost sight of the real point of all this . #% They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list . #% According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , world sugar consumption in 2004-2005 was 144.8 million tonnes , with production at only 149 million tonnes . #% As society stands in the vast majority of Member States , it does not favour the participation of women in the workforce . #% As the largest combined aid donors , the EU Member States must fulfil their Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) commitments , improve aid effectiveness and coordination and strengthen their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 . #% Our refusal to do this , even at the height of the bombing in January , indicated that we prefer the status quo of business as usual , with our contribution of humanitarian aid possibly being a salve to our conscience . #% I should like to thank the Commission and the Spanish presidency for being here at this most important debate here today . #% While I recognise that European industry is a world leader in this technology and I commend its achievements , the current state-of-the-art CO2 systems have a number of disadvantages which make them unsuitable for export outside the EU . #% It is also important to make it clear that retailers who import pre-packaged products directly from third countries are also subject to EU regulation . #% There is no need to reopen the argument concerning the membership of the Commission . #% Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold , traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers . #% Waste oil is considered hazardous in the United Kingdom , whereas in the Republic of Ireland it is not . #% This year has seen strong progress by the opponents of a single currency who have succeeded in raising serious concerns about the effects of a single currency in many people 's minds . #% It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds . #% I welcome the comments of the rapporteur emphasising the need to develop farm holidays . #% The people were disappointed . #% You referred to the point that relative stability and special unique circumstances can not be taken into consideration . #% It is clear that the WTO can not succeed as long as we insist on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihoods of small European and Irish farmers . #% Such self-indulgence must end . #% We want to see them either released or for them to be formally charged and receive an immediate and fair trial . #% There are four particular points that I want to support : first of all , the use of funds to encourage new entrants , to assist the essential transition of farm families from one generation to the next ; secondly , the prioritisation of funding to allow for the modernisation of farms and help with meeting higher animal welfare and environmental standards ; thirdly , maximum regional flexibility on the implementation of the rural development programme must be secured and built upon ; and fourthly and finally , the proposal for village renewal and the preservation of rural heritage is vitally important in revitalising and sustaining the rural communities . #% Some months ago I asked the Commission to undertake a pilot initiative on this . #% Here I also want to commend the work of the dedicated men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary who helped train the local police force . #% The two biggest issues around the Constitutional Treaty are firstly , that 60 million Europeans died in the first half of the last century because we did not have an integrated Europe and secondly , not only governments and parliaments but civil society were involved in the formation of this Constitutional Treaty . #% This would be in total violation of the concepts of human dignity and the right to life as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights . #% Let me make one further point on this . #% And on behalf of my group I must say we were very disappointed to have to take that negative position because we have supported many of the positive aspects of the report . #% The cost to the health services within the Community of a condition which , as I mentioned in my question , will affect approximately 30 million people by the year 2010 , has to some extent to be taken into consideration . #% in writing . - I do not agree with direct-to-consumer advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products . #% I believe that at times , we have to be pragmatic in order to overcome the difficulty . #% Indeed , the RUC has more or less admitted so much by asking British and American police officials to supervise the investigation . #% I want to thank the Commission for its efforts to meet the deadline for the cohesion report , but I regret that we have not yet had the communication on urban policy which was due to come forward in 1996 , and we would like to see that at the beginning of 1997 . #% In fact , it is in that context , in a global market , that the euro perhaps offers its greatest potential to Europe for the future and to the single market in particular . #% However , the point I raised is exceptional . #% One seeks to limit organic seeds to less than 0.1 % GMO contamination , adding another safeguard to the original regulation which only specifies that the parent plant , not the seed , should have been produced organically . #% Will we give an equally positive response to the people who , through courage or desperation , flee these human rights abuses and arrive legally or illegally at our borders ? #% Roisín McAliskey is being kept in a Category A gaol without adequate medical care . #% The most important step is for both sides to desist from further acts of violence . #% We are all aware in this Chamber that the people of Ireland rejected the provisions of the Nice Treaty last year by a small margin . #% I totally agree with all the very many well-deserved , fine compliments which have been paid to you by the leaders of the other Groups here today . #% Some progress is being made but more could be done if we put greater pressure on the Romanian authorities . #% Madam President , unlike the last speaker I do not think this is an issue that should be trivialised in this way . #% The strategy of the government is completely unacceptable . #% The good news is that Morocco has recently become the first Islamic country to sign this particular piece of international legislation , for which I would like to congratulate that country . #% On a personal note I would point out that these last two issues are fundamental to my own country , Ireland . #% Parliament has a wonderful President . #% It is in the interests of all those countries which support a strong agricultural policy , be they existing or future Member States , to see the fastest possible integration into the common agricultural policy . #% The four countries that have met the objectives are Spain , Portugal , Denmark and Finland . #% Colleagues might be interested to know that one of the laureates for the Aristion Prize , which is part of this programme , is the husband of an ex-Member of this Parliament . #% Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off ? #% This has resulted in proponents and opponents alike paying inadequate attention to the practical consequences of abolition . #% But we must all reflect on the key practical procedure being used to streamline the enlargement of the Union . #% 
The Conservatives should accept the verdict of this report and address the issues . #% As I said at the outset , I doubt very much that anybody 12 months ago would have thought that we could have achieved what we did achieve . #% With regard to the matter in hand , I should like to pick up on a point made by the Commissioner earlier today when he talked about the attempt to make foreign policy more effective and to warmly welcome and subscribe to his view on the indivisibility of the Union 's foreign policy . #% Although the overuse of bushmeat is a fast-growing problem everywhere , this report concentrates on Africa because the bushmeat problem there is the most significant and best-described in the literature . #% Member States and the Council will betray the wider public purpose of this proposal if they fail to use the extra revenue from energy tax to offset excessive non-wage , tax-driven labour costs . #% Please ensure that energy efficiency becomes a key national indicator at Barcelona . #% The justification for the aid , namely the necessity to undertake excessively expensive work , still exists . #% No consumer , `` as an individual '' or as a company , can be denied the ultimate right to take legal action but that does not mean that this should be the first course of action . #% Indeed , it could be helpful before Göteborg - if it has not already done so - for the Irish `` no '' campaign as a whole to issue a single joint statement making it clear that their `` no '' campaign was not pushing for a `` no '' to enlargement . #% I disagree , for two reasons . #% Anyone who does not understand that will pay the price through higher interest rates and an inflation-prone Euro-zone . #% However , it contains some good points and I welcome the perspective outlined for us by the President of the Commission , and the Vice-President of the Commission in particular , in pushing the idea of a Plan D and taking up on those good points and moving forward . #% In fact , this scheme was used to underpin the market and the price of cattle , rather than primarily to take out the disease in the older cow . #% The Commission communication ( of 1998 ) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights ` contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law ' . ' #% Unfortunately , the interpretation did not come through in time , so the vote that I cast for the first part should have been for part two . #% You may be curious but you are not going to work on that subject . ' #% We have been eating scrapie-infected sheep for over two hundred years , with no ill effect , and that is because the structure of the shape of the prion , the non-infectious protein , in the sheep , is not compatible to that in the human brain , unlike the rendered cattle or beef prion , that replaces the protein necessary in our brains . #% We must provide more medical help for these victims . #% I recall in particular questions about the overlaps between food law and food safety , the various overlaps that one can imagine with the World Trade Organisation and a host of other responsibilities , not least those of the Environment Commissioner . #% Attitudes may change with new circumstances - in any case , they have to . #% Indeed , we would like to see Commissioner Wulf-Mathies there backing these projects and launching them . #% I draw the Commissioner 's attention to the fact that many of the prisoners who are still suffering in prison without trial have been wounded and are ill , and no information has been made available to their relations . #% I omitted to sign last night as I was travelling all day and arrived a bit late last evening . #% The Commission , Parliament and the EU governments must substantially increase the financial budget for public health campaigns which highlight to teenagers the real dangers of smoking . #% I am presently dealing with a case in Ireland where someone who has trained as a physiotherapist in one Member State can not get their qualification recognised in Ireland because of the formal academic aspect even though in every other country in the European Union work experience is recognised as the equivalent of the academic qualifications . #% For too long mental illness has not been at centre stage in our legislative process and , as is clear from the Commission 's Green Paper and its startling findings , public consciousness through more informed communication is slowly coming to realise that mental illness and its consequences affect the core of our population . #% In the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict . #% We have not even managed to control the amount of fish which is landed , and that is a far simpler task . #% Some of these things , in particular enlargement , will not be achieved without sacrifices by the people who are in the European Union at the present . #% However , the related budgetary payments will be settled within the current limits of the overall ceiling previously agreed for actual expenditure , that is payment appropriations . #% It is ironic to think that the same industries that are promoting this so-called chemical-free agriculture are the very same ones that have bombarded us with chemicals over the years and are making those crops reliant on chemicals in the future as well . #% It is not something to be purloined by the EU in its desperate scramble for internal and external credibility , made more desperate by the humiliating rejection of the unwanted Constitution . #% I was particularly struck by the sincerity of the presentation made to us by the German presidency , and indeed by Commissioner van den Broek . #% They fail to take specific geographical and demographic problems into account . #% In particular , you are to be congratulated on the work and enthusiasm that you have put into the enlargement issue . #% I would ask the Hong Kong authorities to take note of this debate , to take note of this resolution , especially our request for the publication of a draft bill which should be subject to further consultation . #% With the completion of enlargement , Europe has the potential to be a dominant player in world trade . #% This prison state is , as far as we can tell , run in the worst Stalinist tradition , with starvation , terror and indoctrination . #% The present proposal for a Council regulation provides for changes to the area and timing of restrictions designed to protect the spawning of the Douglas Bank herring in the Irish Sea . #% We must also ensure that in our schools and colleges more emphasis is given to looking forward to seeing where the new skills are going to be required in 10 years ' time so that we can put in place the training programmes for that as well . #% Regulatory requirements are an integral part of the functioning of all services , and the need for such requirements increases with the amount of private-sector involvement . #% The EU should encourage reform strategies which involve domestic investors and devote particular attention to decentralised solutions involving small and medium-sized enterprises . #% Mr President , I also welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the common organisation of the market in sugar . #% In recent times , as fleets continue to increase and resource abundance plummets , flags of convenience are increasingly used as a means of avoiding measures taken by countries or regional fisheries organisations to manage fisheries and conserve stocks . #% However , we must not use this failure to secure an agreement as an excuse to block , hinder or stymie the efforts that can currently be made . #% It looked as if that might happen , so I welcome the funding for health and complementary medicine . #% Mr President , with demands for containment of spending this was never going to be a very happy procedure and yet I want to congratulate the rapporteurs , Brinkhorst and Fabra Vallés , and also the Irish presidency , for having achieved what might seem to be the impossible , of meeting our long-term commitments and resolving the immediate problems of today . #% The Western European Union is a military alliance committed to the nuclear deterrent . #% I am also asking for support on Amendment 20 , which seeks to recognise the potential of assisted-living housing . #% It is time to stop just thinking of people in terms of aid , but to start thinking in terms of people as having the enterprising ability to do things for themselves if they are given the support . #% Then we will have a future . #% In relation to the PPE Group 's proposal , I would say that the PPE Group should reflect on this . #% The President of the Commission rightly referred to the importance of research and technology and innovation for the European economy . #% I think it is timely after the security experience gained in the aftermath of September 11th that basic principles can be legally set in stone as to what has to be done in order to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference . #% The challenge that you undertake is at the core of what we do . #% But we would welcome the opportunity to question the Commission in depth and eventually we can have with due process a reflective debate on the matter . #% I would like to draw Parliament 's attention to the situation of the people in Vietnam as a result of the floods . #% We need science to rule here and we need scientific risk assessments of the level of adventitious protein sources in feed . #% Another matter which is of some concern to me is the implementation of equality between men and women and non-discrimination within the framework of the Fund . #% Let me turn to some of the specific points in the resolution before us , which I largely welcome , although I find it rather long and verbose . #% In practice , nuclear decision-making in the UK falls far short of democratic standards . #% For example , our collective economies are only achieving moderate success at this particular time . #% At this hour of the night there is no point in underlining yet again how important a job the Stockholm Convention has to do . #% I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ? #% Mr President , I yield to the temptation to borrow a phrase from Sir Christopher Wren on this occasion : ' Si monumentum requieres , circumspice ' . #% As we all know in this House , disability rights feature prominently within the Spanish system . #% 
Many EU-owned vessels use flags of convenience . #% This would involve a more regional approach to food aid , helping specific regions to build up their food-producing infrastructure . #% Radiation , they say , may cause a much wider range of diseases than epidemiological studies predict . #% What does that tell us about political interference from the top in France ? #% We have made mistakes and we should recognise those mistakes and put those mistakes right sooner , rather than later . #% I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points . #% This directive aims to harmonise laws , regulations and administrative procedures of the Member States concerning agreements covering credit granted to consumers and surety agreements entered into by consumers . #% However , the challenges are on-going and they are worrying . #% The Irish people are a generous people . #% It is good that the Commissioner comes here and gives us full explanations and she is entitled to our support for the long-term objectives which she has set out . #% We particularly welcome the Council 's invitation to the Commission to make proposals as to how new and creative ways can be found to support the fresh opportunities which the peace agreement will bring . #% I have visited Gaza , because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN , and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now , when the borders are closed , Palestinian produce can not move out of the Gaza Strip . #% That has to change if we are serious about making it clear that we stand for the human rights of all . #% They would also lead to a serious deterioration in safety standards , a matter which we must all be very concerned about . #% It seems to me that we must ensure that is not the commitment we bring to Lisbon , rather that we really drive forward . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group I support the initiative of Mrs Green . #% In the United States petrol costs less than bottled mineral water . #% Firstly , I wish to see that funding for research projects is maintained after 2012 , and I would support the initiatives which encourage young beekeepers into the apiculture sector . #% Only one out of 17 equestrian federations throughout Europe was consulted . #% No one could , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist . #% I know I speak for the majority of my colleagues here as well . #% We should hang our heads in shame that we have more legislation on the books of the European Union relating to animal welfare than we have relating to the welfare of children . #% I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member . #% These must be guaranteed to all residents of the Union without discrimination . #% More films were made in Ireland last year than in all previous years put together . #% I thank you sincerely for your understanding of the Irish position on this issue . #% It is inevitable , given the complexity of the problem , that everyone will have some significant reservations about some part of the package . #% We would have liked to see a complete ban on these fragrances , but unfortunately we did not get support within the Committee for that . #% Civilians should be planting but they can not , because of the LRA threat , which is again backed by their own government . #% They are an invitation to terrorists to hijack material for the making of a nuclear bomb . #% The EU is in a very strong position to see exactly which Member States are exercising the best techniques to tackle diseases , such as acute respiratory infections , which is the main cause of death for children under the age of five . #% The Member States too must take their responsibilities seriously and ensure good and correct implementation of internal market laws . #% The second case pending against the Irish Government concerns the failure to supply the Commission with information on hazardous waste installations . #% It is vital , therefore , that we support a compromise that ensures the effective control and enforcement of workers ' rights by keeping the original purpose of the directive . #% I know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime . #% If this happens in future , I would like Parliament to request that this masthead be removed from this magazine . #% Certainly , maintaining the second pillar structure is crucial and will prove to be central to the long-term success of the CAP . #% The only way we can get that is through aggressive diplomacy . #% Until we recognize these particular rights we do not have the moral authority to criticize others elsewhere in the world . #% One of the problems with the refusal by Member States to implement or transpose directives is the Commission 's tardiness in taking punitive action against such Member States . #% When the CFP is revised next year it is essential that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine habitat be made its primary and overriding objective , and the only way to do this is to implement a rigorous and comprehensive precautionary approach to fisheries management . #% Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone . #% I am sure you agree with me that a victim of serious crime endures great pain and suffering , and this is doubly traumatic in a foreign country . #% I should therefore like to know what planning will take place in future . #% More importantly , consumers continue to pay more and more for their food . #% With relation to this whole spamming issue , everybody in Parliament is extremely frustrated with the campaign that is taking place . #% We have to therefore grapple seriously with the whole issue of immigration . #% I do not believe that the response we have had so far from the Commission is at all adequate . #% The suffering and terror endured by the injured and those who died - including four children - during the several days they spent in this sealed metal container is barely conceivable . #% I welcome the increased awareness of the European Ombudsman 's role , reflected in the increased numbers taking their complaints to him . #% It has been a long and hard road . #% The problem next year will be Brazil : they have streamlined their approval system down to 22 months , and the problem will not go away . #% One has only to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Philips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there . #% But we ask the Commission to come forward with a framework directive that will lay down a clear timeframe and detailed monitoring methods because at the end of the day we must protect the most vulnerable and pedestrian safety in our communities is of the utmost importance . #% We have provided the financial control to deal with that . #% If we are to succeed in bringing communities together from both sides of the sectarian divide continued funding for the PEACE programme is crucial #% It is exceedingly urgent . #% I would like to congratulate them warmly . #% However , we do expect that rollout to be completed in 2007 , although the cervical cancer screening programme wo n't be completed until 2008 at the earliest - some 15 years later ! #% However , these were not binding on the Member States . #% Mr Oostlander has been one of the great contributors to this Parliament . #% And lest anyone should attack me on that , I would like to say that I support animal welfare legislation as well . #% In other words , given the particular problems surrounding the proving of homeopathy as against allopathic medicine , the pecular requirements of homeopathy should be taken into consideration in this testing and the expert knowledge of homeopaths applied . #% We will not truly have a single market in the area of passenger cars and road vehicles until we all start driving on the same side of the road so that we can all have either left-hand or right-hand drive cars . #% It is unthinkable to have a modern European Union constitution - which is what the Convention on the future of Europe is looking at - without a binding bill of rights . #% Could you inform Commissioner Fischler 's cabinet that mobile phones are not allowed in this House . #% 
Given the uncertainty that surrounded the issue prior to the Dublin II Summit , perhaps the single most significant political achievement was the agreement of the Stability Pact as part of the necessary preparations for economic and monetary union . #% Therefore , any trade in human egg cells that may be going on from Romania to the United Kingdom is utterly reprehensible and must be condemned . #% I am totally against EU interference in regulating national taxes . #% Quite frankly , I do not think it is a particularly just system because some of the hardest criminals are being released . #% He has looked at creating solutions to the problems that we now face . #% It is this rapid evolution of the virus that makes it such a potential threat . #% If Member States wish to continue with nuclear technologies , the industry as a whole needs to be evaluated to ensure that measures are taken within a programme which puts the principle of sustainability at the centre of decisionmaking . #% The question is how do we respond ? #% Finally , I want to support the author of the resolution , Ms Berès , when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers . #% The judgment was clear in itself , so how could anyone consider that the incineration of household waste was the same as recovery ? #% The unemployment rate in the European Union is twice the level of the United States and three times that of Japan . #% We currently have eight . #% As many speakers have already said , coming up to the Employment Summit , it is one of the key areas where Parliament could at last have its voice heard by the Council and the Heads of Government . #% Europe needs to take a confident and unified step forward . #% The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement . #% Sudan requires a political solution very fast . #% . Mr President , I also wish to thank the rapporteurs for undertaking the very difficult task of trying to find some areas of agreement on the Treaty in the very diverse institution and august body that this Parliament is . #% Widespread genetic engineering of crops and food will surely lead to further intensification of agriculture and what of the health risks from GM products ; the EU Commission has banned the use of BST ( genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone used to increase milk production in the US ) for health reasons . #% We have worked hard scrutinising the strategy papers prepared by the Commission and to formulate positions on different aspects of those strategies . #% The Commission must centralise the information concerning the effects of PVC in our society so that appropriate measures can be taken at national and European level to reduce any possible public health consequences from its use . #% I think we have to look at solutions to the problem without boundary . #% There is also a former state company in Ireland , now privately owned , which services and maintains airlines . #% Ireland is much more energy efficient than it was a decade ago . #% This report leaves that avenue open , and I therefore welcome it . #% I want to thank my colleagues , the officials in committee and the officials in the Commission for their assistance in drawing up this report and I want to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on the presentation of her very comprehensive report . #% The cruelty of the sentence , and the fact that she had given birth one month before , makes it very difficult for us to accept any assurances from the government of Nigeria that they are protecting the civil rights of their people and their own population . #% Animals which react positively to the TB test are slaughtered . #% I think it is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we deliver the strongest possible message that the democratic will expressed by the people of Kosovo is respected , that it is brought to a conclusion and that the European Union has a unified voice on how things should progress in the future . #% It can work , if it gets time . #% It has other facets : basic social need and environmental impact . #% My report is not -- as some lobbyists would believe -- an attack on recreational fishing in any one Member State . #% We have a problem in Europe because we simply have no idea of the numbers of children affected . #% I would support you one hundred percent . #% But let me repeat what I believe is now coming loud and clear from our regions , municipalities and partners : those on the ground who are using these funds will continue to need funds , but they need to have the certainty and security that agreement can be achieved in Berlin . #% Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home , there can be issues of privacy involved . #% It is hypocritical , on public interest grounds , for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market , while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules . #% That is why , in the spirit of better legislation called for by Commissioner Prodi recently , my group will give the Commission conditional support for the regulation if it agrees to carry out an evaluation study to examine exactly how sales below cost can benefit both small businesses and consumers . #% Finally , the opportunity that is now presented by this decision from ETA is a groundbreaking one , but do not forget that opportunity comes to pass , not to pause : we must grasp it now and work to fulfil the ideas within it . #% The requirement for the Commission to present a report , within six years , will also give us the option to revisit this important area and properly assess its impact in practice . #% Decisions of this nature are largely a matter for Member States and the European Parliament must respect subsidiarity . #% At home they say one thing and out here they do something very different . #% It is good to be ambitious but the Liberal Group , while not necessarily against everything that is in the report , has not yet arrived at a level of reflection which allows us to be for everything in the report . #% No matter what part of a country one lived in one got the same level of service at the same cost as everybody else . #% It is extremely difficult to project how the economies of the 15 members will go , how the cost of the CAP will go , how the applicant countries will go over the next five to eight years . #% The future is running fast to meet us and we still have no clear analysis of the impact of EMU on our regions . #% It is a shame on this House that we do so . #% The powerful financial speculators rejected it , as did powerful governments , as not feasible . #% It deals with issues such as rape as a war tool . #% These are essential if the twin aims of consumer security and consumer confidence are to be secured . #% The ` purchase for destruction ' scheme may be necessary in the short term but it is immoral and certainly alien to the ethos of farming . #% You , President-in-Office , have proved your ability and skill in building up the relationship with Russia . #% Let us take a fresh look at how better we can plan the long-term survival of agriculture as the profession responsible for food security and safety , taking account of the unique role of farmers as managers of the environment . #% Could the President-in-Office tell us what is in that package ? #% Part of the motivation behind Agenda 2000 is to conform in a credible way with world trade rules and in the process , of course , to make Europe a key player in world trade - and the Americans will not want that . #% Mr President , I , too , wish to welcome my Dublin colleague , Ruairi Quinn , the Irish Minister for Finance and the President-in-Office of Ecofin , to Parliament this afternoon . #% Until we have sufficient numbers of women at decision-making level , they will not be mainstreamed in policy responses and will not be adequately addressed . #% There are 44 000 people in Ireland with dementia . #% There must be no repeats of last Monday 's accident . #% Already last October , the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement . #% Getting it right is so important . #% What I really want to know is whether the Commissioners attend these meetings in their own private capacity or whether they are representing the Commission . #% I rise to protest at the lack of time given to debate the issue of biodiversity loss during this part-session , as this is Green Week . #% I have to ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken Asia is producing and exporting to Europe . #% If other Member States then proceed to behave in the same sort of way , this could lead to individual items being banned in every Member State in the Community at different times , and there will be no guarantee that the single market , which we worked so hard in this Parliament to bring about and to consolidate , will work properly . #% We should respect the undisputed scientific consensus that fishmeal poses no risk of TSE . #% author . - Madam President , I want to make a couple of important and essential points . #% 
We need it more than the larger states . #% I am actively canvassing for a yes-vote in the referendum which I hope will be carried . #% For Europe , in good faith and in good conscience , the ELDR Group believes this Commission should go . #% One of the things which surprised me in preparing this reply to the honourable Member 's question was that we were not able in the short time available to determine or even make an accurate estimate which I could give to the House of the number of alcoholics within the European Union . #% The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story , and we want to keep it that way . #% That is something that is very important . #% Good for him . #% With regard to the budget , we did not have access to the final details when this report was being drawn up . #% With these reservations , I am pleased to support the report . #% On 4 June 2006 , to the surprise of many , the Islamic Courts militia took control of much of southern Somalia , including the capital Mogadishu -- partially destroyed by now -- when they drove out the powerful faction leaders who had controlled Mogadishu since 1991 , when the central administration was toppled . #% The European Commission , of course , analyses very carefully all action plans on employment which are forwarded to us on an annual basis by the EU Member States so as to ensure that comprehensive and streamlined measures to promote equality in our society are supported . #% Robert McCartney 's sisters continue their quest for justice and we must support them here in this House where we can . #% There is a major vacuum here in that European taxpayers ' money goes to fund these fisheries agreements without the possibility of looking to see how the money has been spent , particularly when it is in the area of development and surveillance . #% We have to look at how we treat asylum seekers and refugees , especially in the current situation where there is a lot of anxiety about what is happening in the former Yugoslavia and the number of refugees there . #% Legislation should be adequate and workable , but most importantly it should achieve its stated objectives . #% Finally , there must be recognition that every human person is valuable and worthy of respect and that this respect demands that we allow people to speak and decide for themselves whenever humanly possible . #% There is growing public concern about the long-term environmental impact in general of landfill sites . #% Could the Commissioner confirm that it is her intention that whatever regulation is needed will pass into law by summer of next year ? #% But in Britain , BNFL has recently admitted the falsifications of safety checks on MOX fuel while in Japan the authorities have found that the plant at Tokaimura was operating illegally for four years . #% It was a good and open debate , but we should have had more debates like that one . #% I know the Commissioner has said that it is up to national governments and that the banks are not subject to Regulation ( EC ) No 2560/01 , but surely it should be possibly to introduce regulations to ban these surcharges . #% We know this is acceptable to the United Nations and the Palestinians , but regrettably it has been rejected by the Israelis . #% I know that the Commission and members of the Council have consulted with the Association of Scheduled Airlines which represents the larger airlines in Europe , but no charter airlines were consulted , no airport managers were consulted and no ferry companies were consulted . #% Mr President , Commissioner , it is a sad fact , but we must face up to the reality that there are far too many drivers on our roads without sufficient insurance . #% Mr President , this is obviously an important debate and I share the concern of Members who are anxious to support research to enable the genuine and continual advance of medicine and the improvement of the quality of life for the individual and society , while at the same time , safeguarding the dignity of each individual from abuse , resulting from breaches of the ethical standards necessary for the implementation of these safeguards . #% It should be pointed out that the French Government had intended to bring a similar case but decided against doing so as it was clear that such a case had no chance of success . #% Whereas the level of funding must in particular meet the needs of the less-developed Irish subregions , it is my view that they should cover the whole country during the entire seven-year period of the next financial framework . #% I paid the price financially but that is not really what is at issue . #% This is really the central dichotomy that exists within the Union at this time . #% This means , for the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna , that any plan or project not directly connected with , or necessary for the management of , the site , but which is likely to have a significant effect thereon -- either individually or in combination with other plans or projects -- shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications on the site . #% While we realise that the prime objective of this directive was to protect minority shareholders ' and investors ' interests against unscrupulous directors and inefficient company boards in a takeover or merger , in conciliation we achieved the incorporation of amendments tabled by the Socialist Group , which meant that this directive would have recognised the legitimate interests of employees in a takeover bid . #% Thank you , Mr-President-in-Office , for that very full answer . #% The tragedy demonstrates once again the desperate lengths to which people are prepared to go to try to improve circumstances for themselves and their families . #% I am unable to support a series of amendments that seek to go further than is necessary . #% Of course I support Parliament 's new emphasis on health and safety at work . #% My question , therefore , is : to what extent can an agreed reform be protected in the context of the forthcoming WTO negotiations ? #% The issue is not about keeping people out , but making sure that , having come in , they are treated with the dignity they deserve . #% We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life . #% One is to protect the stability of the financial services market , and the other is to protect the interests of the investor . #% For far too long consumers have been influenced by marketing and advertising , much of which was without any basis . #% This inquiry must therefore continue . #% It is very important that we have the opportunity to question the Commission on this sensitive issue and the issue between questioning and debate should not loom so large . #% This report assesses the effectiveness of such human rights clauses as regards implementation and adherence and proposes new ways to strengthen the clause to make it more effective and better monitored . #% Therefore , I would ask the Commission , when it gets this report back from the Parliament , to study very carefully the effect in every single country . #% I have asked that this be communicated to the chairman of the Intergovernmental Group and the matter is being examined . #% This is an austerity budget which stays in line with inflation . #% Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mrs Paulsen on her report . #% Mr President , the European Union and the Member States must work closely together and liaise with Europe 's motor and oil industries at all times so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future . #% Now we all accept that fishing activity must be limited in line with declining resources , but the Commission 's proposals are unfair and contradictory . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome , very warmly , the report by my colleague , Thomas Mann , because it looks to the future and that is what we are talking about . #% Mr President , on a real point of order , could you rule on whether or not Mr Watson 's intervention was actually a point of order ? #% The links between the nuclear power industry and the nuclear weapons industry for many years led to an ethos of tremendous secrecy and a refusal to admit anything could ever possibly be wrong . #% Member State governments must put in place a favourable tax regime which will encourage and reward enterprise , bearing in mind that a tax concession which encourages enterprise is far more cost-effective than the payment of social welfare to the unemployed . #% The fact that we are projecting to spend more money on rural Europe , together with the fact that the number of people involved in agriculture is decreasing , ensures that for the next seven years there is a minimum standard of living guaranteed to people involved in agriculture . #% We need to ensure that all employment policies are people-centred , not merely a response to an urgent need in one or other Member State . #% More pressure is needed on China and Russia in particular to play a more positive role in Sudan . #% I fully agree on the need to simplify the administrative procedures and to make the programmes more accessible and relevant to national agencies and participants , in particular the proposal to develop the Symmetry information management system . #% Once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has BSE , then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that , then the whole herd should be taken out . #% Our inaction will cost lives . #% The family recipe , the local flavour , the hand-made product , the quality and unique character need our protection to keep our regions as rich as they are now . #% When , therefore , we consider the recently signed agreement with Mauritania , costing EUR 430 million over five years , the Senegal agreement is very modest in financial terms . #% Yet Mr Patten insists that the police must be responsible to a new ruling body on which the IRA will be represented . #% I believe that his kind of experience is vital and that we need some kind of audacious political gesture very quickly if we are not to see the whole thing fall down around our ears . #% Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr Wynn , all the rapporteurs and Mrs Theato and to say that they are a group of people dedicated to the whole business of getting the Community 's finances in order . #% I am a friend of Islam and I think we should stop , in this European Union and the European Parliament , demonising the Arabs and demonising Islam . #% Instead of being a puppet of the Israelis , the US should be independent and use its influence to pressurise them to end their violence , just as we , in the EU , must use our influence with the Palestinians to do likewise . #% 
Respect and tolerance are needed more than anything else now . #% I hope that avoids any confusion during the vote . #% The World Health Organisation is putting GBP 7 million into research and I am asking you tonight to give your commitment to a European Union study to look at potential links between DVT and air travel and preventative action . #% The Arab League has finally pledged some economic support and EU Member States also need to be generous in this regard . #% The political establishment in that country has dismally failed its people , particularly the youth . #% That was what the General Affairs Council on 29 October agreed as the basis of the European Union approach on the subject of the Singapore conference . #% It is going to take the candidate countries time to implement this full body of legislation . #% in writing . - I supported the resolution on the new Commission recommendation to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations with the United States on the transfer of financial messaging data to combat terrorism . #% It has now been revealed that the British Government , Blair and company , told lies to justify backing the American and British invasion and occupation . #% Indeed , they are even trying to close the important link between Belfast and the port of Larne . #% It is very good to start the work of this new Parliament with programmes which can make a difference , both to the environment and , of course , to the competitiveness needs of our Member States . #% It is extremely important that we take note of the situation and seek to find emergency solutions because this is an emergency . #% There were many important points put directly to Commissioner Figel ' ; I should be delighted if he would respond to them . #% Especially for island states in the EU including Ireland , it really warrants particular attention and I wonder what the Commissioner is actually afraid of by refusing to carry out the study that so many people have called for . #% Delays at this stage are unacceptable and Parliament must keep up the pressure on the Council and on Member States to conform fully with our revised food laws . #% Sustained attacks by Israel on the Palestinian Authority and its security forces and facilities are wholly misguided . #% While I welcome the general commitment towards ensuring the health and safety of workers and also guaranteeing that there is cohesion across the Member States with regard to the minimum protection that will be available , I fear for certain sectors . #% We have an important job to do to explain the workings of the whole productive system to the consumers of Europe and those outside the Union who will buy our food . #% He has raised a number of issues which merit further consideration . #% We need to know what are the revenue implications for states . #% The incomplete market has created nearly EUR 1 000 billion of prosperity and 2.5 million additional jobs in Europe . #% His brutal beating and stabbing was a serious and savage attack , which bore all the hallmarks of a politically motivated IRA murder . #% What is that saying about French beef production and protectionism ? #% We do not even use the money that is available in the European Union as well as we could . #% Organic and genetic modification are opposites . #% I also believe it will be an act of folly for Ireland to join EMU if Britain remains outside , as appears increasingly likely . #% So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here . #% Twenty-two thousand children do not need to die each day , every day . #% Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories . #% The reality of the terrible experience facing many immigration and asylum seekers is revealed in eight people dead and others who are seriously ill . #% Clearly , it is absolutely necessary to increase the resources available for developing these TENs . #% The EU is the world 's biggest aid donor and is responsible for 55 % of all development aid . #% I would certainly oppose any move towards renationalisation . #% I encouraged Mr von Wogau to table this question because I believed that Parliament would treat this important precedent in a fair and balanced way - and indeed it has . #% We need to try to get the maximum amount of action to encourage an end to this bloodshed and violence . #% We have a situation in the European Union where farmers are leaving the industry hand over fist in every Member State . #% It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this . #% These conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period . #% Finally , to ensure that doctors in the Member States understand what these cards mean , a training or advertising programme should be put in place . #% I am not arguing against caution , but the Council expressed views today which were not balanced . #% It is no secret that Article 9 , and the right of boards to take defensive action without shareholder approval , was the bone of contention in conciliation . #% At the end of the 20th century to ban an exhibition by a gay artist is completely unacceptable and no Member of this Parliament should endorse that . #% I am pleased to say many of them were taken on board by the Commission . #% Russia has enough problems without confronting Chechnya , and it always strikes me that this House is reluctant for the most part to criticise Russia in circumstances such as this . #% Our laws now must reflect this change in consumer behaviour . #% As the stocks in EU waters which were the traditional target of EU vessels were becoming depleted , the result was the development of these new fisheries . #% But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission . #% In the amendments to my report , we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed , including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market , either voluntarily or , if necessary , with legislation . #% We are all aware of the success the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has had over the last five years in confiscating the proceeds of crime . #% Basically , Ireland is very ill equipped for dealing with major accidents in the chemicals industry . #% Therefore , what is most of all required within the new framework is certainty with regard to the protection available and the responsibilities of the people who are trading on-line . #% There is no specific treatment or vaccine available yet for the ravages of Ebola , which has hit the headlines in recent years in these parts and which has killed 1 200 since the virus was first discovered . #% Many years later I am disappointed to see yet another presidency having to list as one of its objectives that of finishing the preparations for the establishment of Europol . #% We must also prevent the construction of projects or the manufacture of products that have devastating consequences for the environment in these places . #% I regret that clearer and more ambitious targets were not included , however . #% We must ensure that our ports and airports are properly controlled in every way . #% I have recently learnt that , in Ireland , beef from South America has been found to be labelled as Irish . #% Does it not fly in the face of wanting to persuade Member States to be more responsible and , if they are more responsible , allow them to be ? #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% There are 40 Spanish factory vessels in the Irish Box as we speak . #% With any model of social dialogue and social partnership , rights are devolved to the social partners to negotiate , consult and come up with framework agreements which should be implemented on a European basis . #% At the COP 11/MOP 1 meeting in Montreal next month , the focus will be on post-Kyoto and on what happens beyond 2012 . #% I shall confine my remarks to the Maaten report . #% In the light of what is coming down the line , I would be interested to know whether the Commission proposes to take a more proactive approach to this . #% Those who take pleasure in pointing out that agriculture takes up almost 50 % of the budget should keep in mind that this general support is as much a subsidy to consumers as it is support for the farming community - the people who are expected to guarantee food supply and quality and at the same time maintain the rural environment . #% The nuclear industry however still affects our environment and health as foreign nuclear power plants have affected our seas and countryside causing health problems for our population . #% 
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and also to pay tribute to Commissioner Flynn for his involvement in this whole area . #% This report , along with his colleagues ' reports , calls for a rejection of the Council text . #% I am sure the President 's heart is in the right place when it comes to promoting rural tourism . #% Biofuels offer excellent new opportunities and can utilise the expertise notably of Irish tillage farmers . #% It is worth noting , however , that we have heard this argument since discussions about Directive 90/220/EEC first started in 1989 . #% In fact , the gap in wealth is stretching every year . #% Mr President , as parliamentarians we have a duty to uphold the democratic will of the citizens we represent in keeping with the laws and the constitutions of our sovereign Member States . #% I hope we will do this following the ratification of the Europol Treaty . #% There is nowhere in the whole of European Union where renewable energy is not relevant , whether it is Lapland or the Islands of Greece . #% It is a small part of what is needed . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I welcome the action of the Committee on Legal Affairs in putting this timely question to the Commission . #% This report includes a proposal calling on European Union airlines to inform passengers of the percentage degree seat pitch available to passengers travelling in economy class . #% As a direct result of this petition we have discovered some very alarming things about some gas heaters , including the fact that 61 people died in Belgium last year as a direct result of carbon monoxide poisoning from water heaters . #% This is a very serious issue . #% Do their votes count for nothing ? #% We want a secure state for Israelis and a viable democratic state for Palestinians , based on the pre-1967 borders . #% This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well . #% Africa needs our help and we will give it generously , but Africa must reciprocate by treating its citizens humanely . #% Capital moves easily across borders as multinational firms seek out the most attractive business locations . #% I do not have to remind the House of the relevance of sheep farming in areas not suited to other agricultural enterprises and the importance , from a rural development perspective , of sustaining farm families in those areas . #% I and many of my colleagues were caught in this dilemma . #% Furthermore , they need to look at their criminal code sections on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws can not be applied against those merely exercising their right to freedom of expression , as well as at the administrative detention directive which allows for the detaining of individuals for up to two years . #% I would be grateful if colleagues whose assistants are experiencing difficulties in their travel arrangements and , indeed , colleagues in the same predicament , could contact my office as soon as possible . #% We could have had a decent common fisheries policy without taking fish into common ownership . #% We all know that the overwhelming majority of both petty and organised crime is drug-related . #% Mr President , I wish to speak briefly on another point of order in relation to the Minutes . #% That means that we also need to think of the consequences of the midnight deals and compromises that we make , and consider whether they are going to confuse or clarify laws for end users . #% In Ireland some schools have been providing driving lessons as part of the transition year curriculum . #% ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 . #% This is very loose but effective cooperation . #% Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III . #% I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Daul , on his work , which I have no difficulty in supporting on behalf of my group . #% In the laborious process of negotiating this legislation , it was the clear intention of the legislators -- Parliament and the Council -- to provide for the widest possible interpretation of the powers for environmental measures to be taken on the basis of a single market legal base . #% What does the decision mean for the world community ? #% We have a Union where we not only cooperate as states but we also share our sovereignty and our law-making in the best interests of ourselves as individual Member States and the total population of the European Union . #% Mr Meehan has said to me that the SOLVIT system could benefit from joint cooperation with Europe Direct . #% Does this mean we are giving up and accepting the dire prediction in the 2005 Green Paper ? #% In the last session , when speaking on the Nitrates Directive , I stated that not even the European Parliament can legislate for weather across Europe and I have not changed my mind . #% We also need to ensure that people of a different generation from the present younger generation are not disadvantaged because of lack of access to training for this new means of communication and this new information network . #% There is plenty of evidence of the inhuman treatment of cats and dogs bred for fur . #% In the special report on the reform of the cereals sector , the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself attains its economic and social objectives . #% This creates a system where there is free movement of people from one Member State to the next . #% Secondly , with regard to the whole patents area , there must be protection of the ideas and creations that come from that innovative strategy and policy . #% He has also appointed Ms Ann Hennon to assist me and I am also happy today to acknowledge the presence , in the gallery , of Mr Adair Dyer , who is the deputy secretary-general of the Hague Conference on private international law , specifically charged with the Hague convention dealing with this issue . #% I fear that the proposals will come to nothing without a change of mind by several Member States , my own of course included . #% I supported this report which establishes a common register for lobbyists ( transparency register ) between the European Parliament and Commission . #% I welcome the efforts to resolve what the President-in-Office has described as ` these dangerous developments ' . #% When oil prices rise we conserve energy , when they fall we do not . #% These workers were willing to work for considerably below the going rate when the airline started , recognising that the company could not afford the higher wages at the time . #% I earnestly call for an awareness programme to be put in place to alert non-Irish nationals on this issue . #% We must acknowledge that he is a person who understands the common agricultural policy in all its extremely complicated detail . #% I would like to acknowledge the work of the Irish presidency over the last six months and to wish the new Dutch presidency well . #% in writing . - Youth on the Move is a fantastic initiative , and I strongly support the group in giving it my full support . #% The list proposed by Commissioner Lamy is not restrictive - WTO members could ask for World Health Organisation guidance for any other serious public health problems which may arise in the future or are not covered by the list as it stands . #% The tourism industry in Europe was extremely hard hit in the past year following 11 September . #% In some countries , an NGO can be formed with a membership of less than five people . #% It is a sector with considerable potential but like any other business it needs some reasonable stability in terms of its business conditions . #% Training is often deficient , and for young people it can be an isolated life in rural areas , with limited social activity in comparison with those of a similar age who work in more urban settings . #% As the Commission points out , the proposed joint action does not seek to introduce a new right to seek temporary protection in addition to the existing right to seek asylum . #% Even though I have consistently opposed nuclear power , I feel that the discussion was used by extreme opinion on both sides of the nuclear argument and this ensured that a common ground could not be found in Parliament . #% The revision of this agreement must be consistent with the needs of the new world we live in and must be based on a partnership of equals . #% It found that in the three large harbours which carry on the fishing endeavour - and I refer to Kilkeel , Ardglass and Portavogie - all the fishing is carried on within a family system . #% Updating this law is not enough . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs van den Burg for an enormously well done job and the Commissioner for introducing this directive . #% The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna . #% Perhaps if Members listened to the debate they might contribute more light than heat . #% 
I am hopeful that these declarations will fully clarify the political concerns that people had with this specific issue during the last Nice Treaty referendum . #% Now the Commission says that the farmers must repay this money which prevented cruelty to animals . #% I am not a pacifist - although I do not suggest that there is anything wrong with being a pacifist - but I am seriously concerned about the impact that a unilateral war against Iraq will have on the future of the world order , and the kind of world we will live in , if we do not , as a Parliament , make our position clear : unless we have international law moderated through the United Nations , we will have no law . #% The starting point is indisputable but many views , including my own , differ as to the quantification of the state of stocks . #% It is important , of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions . #% Ireland is an island and we export over 90 % of our total production . #% The expansion of the single market should be of real and tangible interest to European exporters and to indigenous European companies seeking investment abroad . #% It is important for Parliament to put down a marker with regard to the Commission 's efforts to draw back prematurely from decisions taken in Berlin , which , in the case of the sugar regime , were to remain in place until 2006 . #% I hope that this IGC deals with the structural deficiencies , that we end unanimity and replace it with QMV , that we strengthen the relationship with the Commission and the Parliament in this whole area and move away from intergovernmentalism and that we promise to start a real debate on the framing of a defence policy , hopefully incorporating the WEU and the EU pillar . #% Mr President , since our debate last year on enlargement , there has been very considerable and commendable progress . #% I would like to request that you inform the House , if possible this week , whether any efforts have already started on the part of both Parliament and the Commission to enable the citizens of Gibraltar to vote in the coming European elections . #% The implementation of Ms Angelilli 's report means that the protection of children from these abusive practices will increase in response to technological developments , targeting , in particular , the sinister practice of ` grooming ' . #% I would like to thank the United Kingdom Government and its Prime Minister for their tremendous effort in guiding the peace process in my country to where it is at the present time . #% That is enormously important for the credibility of what we do in that area and for our legitimacy with our citizens in what we do in that area . #% Having put the ban in place , I see no option but to hold the line and to continue even if we have to buy our way out . #% The Treaty of Nice could mean that a number of Member States could decide to go ahead with a nuclear-armed force even though other states do not agree . #% I am in favour of the report , but I have specific concerns . #% Whilst provisions specific to exposure to artificial radiation are appropriate , the inclusion of natural sunlight radiation caused me to vote against this Directive as excessive and burdensome in its ambit and impact . #% Whether or not nuclear power stations are taken out of operation at the planned date or earlier is entirely a matter for the Member State concerned . #% While we have no objections to further analysis , my delegation would require strong supporting evidence before being able to consider backing such a proposal . #% I would hope that next September we will have something where each initiative , in methodological terms , is justified . #% Governments also need to understand that carers need more help and more staff need to be employed by health boards in Member States to provide carers with respite care , day care and other supports . #% It is for the citizens of a Member State to decide whether or not they will choose to fund national political parties or independent representatives . #% Taking out a mortgage to buy a house is usually the largest and most expensive personal financial commitment entered into by most people . #% The Mercosur Trade deal has the potential to seriously undermine European agriculture and the work of European farmers in delivering public goods and high quality , safe food . #% They need encouragement and those firms need help . #% Mr President , I am wearing several hats this morning , so I apologise for the confusion . #% The areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection , healthcare , taxation and recognition of academic qualifications , particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States , such as in border regions . #% Others may make the case for reintroducing a zero quota if they wish , but as it stands , it makes no sense . #% I am not totally convinced that the consumer is really demanding this . #% Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs , reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice . #% I think that each of us has to come to this debate and to this argument from the basis of guaranteeing maximum opportunities for employment , maximum opportunities for social protection and maximum opportunities for forward-planning with regard to pension needs . #% In conclusion , it is essential that whatever regulation we adopt aims at an exemplary level of safety in sea transport and the prevention of pollution in our seas . #% I have tabled amendments to that effect . #% There is no need for it . #% The UN General Assembly meeting back in January 1946 , in its first resolution , unanimously called for a commission to make proposals for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and all major weapons of mass destruction . #% Beef producers were already facing heavy financial losses before the BSE crisis . #% Anyone who has any knowledge of Albania will know that the people of that country are suffering very much already . #% We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty . #% She has now given birth to her baby and is out on temporary bail . #% In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland , for example , English companies certainly operate there . #% Commissioner , I hope you will take up the issues in the committee 's question . #% As to the issue of climate , all I can say is that in Ireland we do not have a climate , we have weather . #% As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities . #% There is a lack of harmonization to date and Mr Mombaur is quite right to call for harmonization . #% Finally , Mr President , it is obvious we need further informed debates in helping to allay the citizens ' concern on the health aspect of incineration , a matter which has been addressed through extensive research carried out in various Member States and through the experience gained in the many state-of-the-art facilities now in operation throughout Europe . #% All vehicles within the European Union must now be fully recyclable by the year 2015 . #% I would like to ask the Commission to investigate -- or maybe it has already done this -- whether the transportation and treatment of these ships is in breach of Natura 2000 legislation . #% I believe that Members of this House can play a role in communicating effectively and without panic what is happening throughout the European Union and why we are taking action . #% How is it done ? #% There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock . #% But make no mistake : it is part of a grand design for an integrated and EU-controlled criminal justice system requiring , of necessity , the subservience of national systems . #% I have grave reservations about the idea of a common European embassy , given that in the past people fleeing persecution in certain countries were able to go into some embassies and seek asylum and get protection . #% This language is not appropriate to the sensitivities and subtleties required in this historic debate and it constitutes loose talk which opens up an appalling prospect , not least in the hearts and minds of those who support enlargement , and especially in candidate States and in their capital cities . #% We can learn how the United States tackles this problem , in relation not only to prevention - it saves some USD 6 billion per year by preventing incidents like this - but to its response when incidents do happen . #% Multidisciplinary research , yes ; a European higher education area , with the synergies that implies for the European research area . #% In the context of this recovery , I would like to stress the main points of the report . #% Yes , we have a duty of care to the developing world , but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers . #% But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment . #% I am confident that the Irish and European consumer organisations will support this proposal and that EMU will become a reality in the near future despite the apprehensions of certain members of the Union . #% We should ensure that it is in step with scientific best practice in this area , with minimum red tape , that it is SME - and consumer-friendly and , most importantly , that it does what it says on the tin , i.e. it becomes a tool to help combat obesity and other chronic diseases . #% By not ratifying Aarhus , the Irish Government thinks it can continue its practice of riding roughshod over its people , whilst kowtowing to any and every wealthy investor , regardless of the damage it will do to people 's lives , health and environment . #% Mr President , there is no military solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people . #% Professional fees for example are not included in this labour cost index and we all know the extent to which professional fees are virtually uncontrollable . #% They sustain environmental sustainability . #% Another issue is climate change . #% 
The reason for Mr Hyland asking this question , and why I am taking it on his behalf , is that over the last few years we have seen more and more young people becoming disconnected from political and civil life . #% We have to be careful and I would trust your experience and judgement in that . #% However , I urge that sanctions be introduced to ensure that , on its adoption , this directive will be implemented effectively . #% This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity . #% Yet until the EU is able to come to grips with the severity of the problem of discards , and accepts that they are both unnecessary and wasteful , no real progress will be made . #% Both the Republic and the North of Ireland seek to continue the derogation agreed in December 1999 , because of geographic and geopolitical reasons . #% I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do , we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect , because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely , and could be much better spent . #% So , too , the Commission has a case to answer . #% We would actually like to see these things incorporated in a way that it would be vigorous and representative of a wider opinion . #% We are here not to hold on to one ideological viewpoint , but to give what we consider to be a fair , honest and truthful account of what is contained within the text of the Treaty . #% Can any of us imagine what it would be like to lose a loved one because of a so-called political cause ? #% As important as it may be for us to be prudent , prepared and aware of any dangers or risks that may present themselves , it is equally wrong of us to be scaremongering as regards any immediate threat and the dangers it presents . #% Studies have also shown that social measures such as maternity leave help increase the female employment rate by 3-4 % . #% The EU 's lust for endless enlargement is driven by a craving for ego-building world status , which goes hand in hand with the drive for super-statehood through the rejected Constitution . #% If Lisbon can meet the targets spoken of here today , it will be an important step on that road to releasing the dynamic to which I have referred . #% You have represented us all with very great dignity and at all times showed great respect for all the Members of this Parliament . #% Of course , in the Commission communication consistency is a stated objective . #% Nothing will be achieved if we take with one hand and give with another . #% Firstly , I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated . #% Application to see the complete list of reviewers is refused . #% Would the Commissioner agree that at this time , when migration throughout the European Union is increasing , implementation of the posting of workers directive is crucial in order to ensure that there is no race to the bottom and that migrant workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers ? #% It will now proceed in May 2004 , ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed , Mr President , during your final six months as President of this Parliament . #% I will conclude , Mr President : this is why it is essential that each and every one of the chemicals added to cigarettes goes through the centralised registration and authorisation procedure envisaged in REACH . #% Fuel cells , a technology of the future . #% Violence has been used in the past to settle differences and has once again triumphed over dialogue . #% We did not support Amendment 8 as we must consider all options rather than commit specifically to a ` Tobin-style ' tax . #% We have taken an initiative across the various political groups , which we presented in February to President Prodi . #% I can not offer the same praise to the Council of Ministers , because in our committee we have seen a whole succession of very large cuts with no rationale whatsoever provided as to why they should have taken place . #% Proper monitoring of the implementation of the rules of the directive is now urgently required . #% This has to be a benefit in what we call `` rip-off Britain '' , by driving down high prices in our own over-priced internal home market . #% We have also launched this year Telefís na Gaeilge , an all-Irish-speaking television station . #% The UK continues to have a flourishing trade in British-made military goods . #% Mr President , as we tabled this resolution to the committee oral question , we want to make it clear in the title that it is the G7 proposal for the Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4 nuclear power reactors in Ukraine . #% I was present at the House and I contributed to the debate on Northern Ireland . #% I believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the United Nations resolution . #% Parliament has agreed to change the format of its human rights report to have a much tighter focus on issues where the EU has a direct impact or influence and to focus on EU human rights policy , in particular on guidelines that have been set out and the performance of the three institutions in implementing those guidelines . #% So Parliament is entitled to ask if this is actually a Council position or the position of one Member State . #% Sports transcends all boundaries . #% If commitment is lacking , then enforcement measures need to be put in place . #% No European city is without refugees , primarily women , who have been illegally trafficked for the purpose of prostitution . #% How are we meant to function in this way ? #% That is not the appropriate place for the decommissionining of the JRC 's facilities . #% All four objectives are important and I congratulate the European Commission on its intention to establish coordinating measures . #% In addition , institutional prices for sugar have declined continuously since 1985 by 36 % in real terms . #% However , this report and these proposals indicate that our poorest regions could win twice over from enlargement , with a bigger internal market and a continuation of regional aid . #% I also want to refer to the question of the Statement of Assurance and discharge . #% As the UN definition of reproductive health services is so much in conflict with our position as stated in the Treaties - in particular with the protocol of my country - does the Council intend to challenge this publicly stated definition or to change the definition of reproductive health services within the institutions of the EU ? #% That is robbing Peter to pay Paul . #% in writing . - Europe must not fail the Palestinian people yet again . #% Mr President , I was present . #% This action plan of the Commission 's is unambitious . #% If they are , they should be prosecuted for it . #% East Timor is a country cursed with oil and gas . #% Unfortunately we do not have to vote on these issues at this stage . #% This operation is going to go ahead , and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission 's perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups . #% It is very difficult to get any information from the Foreign Office even though the new Labour Government has promised openness and transparency . #% How can you regard this as cooperation ? #% We have a budget surplus of nearly 5 % of our gross domestic product . #% New structural funds have been allocated to it and will be re-routed away from the project if work does not commence by the year 2000 . #% There is no regulatory requirement to check additionality on an annual basis , but as stated in the regulation , simplification requires three checks on additionality during the programming period . #% This is very important because intelligence agencies within the Union , together with Europol , have to work much more closely together in terms of exchanging and sharing information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken . #% Guantánamo has become , in publicity terms , an open sore for many people in relation to all that is negative about the so-called war on terrorism . #% Anyone with pride in his or her own nation , who does not want to see it subsumed into a hideous conglomerate , will reject this tawdry Constitution . #% That document indicates that liberalisation in general is having a net beneficial effect , but I would suggest to the Commission that they need to come forward with a lot more research and hard evidence in relation to specific sectors to convince me that it is true in all cases . #% Aer Lingus estimates that up to 200 jobs would be put directly at risk if it is forced out of airport groundhandling services while the central representative Council of Trade Unions at Dublin Airport envisages a steep decline in safety . #% The loosely-framed common position must be tightened up to discourage free-riders who do not take responsibility for their own waste . #% 
It is unfortunate that it took a considerable time to get the stretcher to take Mr Staes out of the Chamber . #% The EU is 20 billion euro short of its funding commitments , at a time when states are cutting back their aid budgets . #% I believe that we have a duty to contribute to the upholding of peace but I think it legitimate to do so in a manner true to our own traditions . #% In addition we are all conscious of the anxieties in the minds of so many Germans , who twice in living memory have seen their life savings destroyed by hyperinflation , that this should never happen again . #% In conclusion , this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to . #% There also has to be full implementation of existing legislation , as well as simpler and more efficient redress facilities for ordinary citizens . #% First of all , in relation to the reconstruction works , let me say that I recently conducted the launch for the World Bank of a document explaining , in a very well-designed handbook , exactly how reconstruction should take place . #% I would ask the Member States and those present to allow the continuation of that derogation . #% We are , of course , entering a period of intense debate on the future of the CAP , and I believe that this is a fundamental problem that should continue to be addressed in the context of a revised EU agricultural policy after 2013 . #% I want to compliment him on the wonderful work he has done to help the disabled since he came into office and also on the recent statement in Mayo concerning the funds that should and could be spent by national governments for the disabled . #% I make the plea that we continue to support this . #% I therefore question whether a further assault on State aid is justified in pursuit of the failing Lisbon Agenda . #% By the way , Iraq currently has a GM ban . #% Indeed , we are all being drawn into an internal political debate but as the rapporteur says , the consequences of the decision were indeed dreadful . #% The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency . #% Is that our vision for Europe ? #% All amendments concerning delegated acts from first reading should be reinstated . #% We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction . #% We pass laws every month for controls and limits that protect the vulnerable . #% I say it is time we learnt the lesson and put some steel back into our stand against this hideous regime . #% The European Union as a political entity is a friend , and will always be a friend , to the Muslim people . #% It is what your shareholders want . #% We had guaranteed these people that if they exercised their democratic rights and voted we would protect them and see it out to the end . #% There is a moral and political responsibility which can not be swept under the carpet . #% Madam President , for the past six months to a year , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has been calling on the Commission to do something about the drought in Ethiopia . #% Additionally , the decision by the United Kingdom , Sweden and Denmark to opt out of the single currency did not prevent its establishment , which , given the magnitude of the technical problems involved , was a massive achievement by the Commission . #% The two directives were very carefully calculated to ensure that there would not be huge and sudden job losses - approximately 250,000 jobs have been lost in this sector , with more to come - and secondly to allow those Member States which had invested heavily in , for example , nuclear energy to do some strategic planning and not leave them with too much in the way of stranded costs . #% As a democracy , where the people are sovereign , the Irish people is also entitled to decide to reconsider its decision and to confirm or reverse it . #% As the rapporteur has pointed out , there is a suggestion that exposure to electromagnetic fields could lead to an increase in occurrences of cancer and other serious threats to human health . #% I have had seven years to observe Charlie 's distaste for wasting taxpayers ' money on social services . #% We must improve the methods of monitoring and impose stronger penalties for breaches . #% Fishmeal is an important protein source and I think that fear alone should not keep it out of the food chain . #% We had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water . #% At my initiative , as rapporteur , I felt it was essential to reach a compromise with the Council on a second reading , and this package is exactly that . #% Over that period of time , that voluntary group has raised over EUR 60 million for humanitarian and medical aid for Chernobyl and Belarus . #% Certainly one of the key results of this new broader EU policy has been the broadening of powers to Europol . #% For example , the overall amount indicated for Ireland from the programme is $ 25m . #% May I say to the Presidency that the difference with the DCECI is that it seeks to replace 16 codecided regulations with one regulation . #% Once again , the priority is to ensure that these measures and this production are market led and that the measures we put in place under rural development programmes add value to these local products . #% Mr President , my comments relate to the remarks made earlier on fair trade . #% We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels . #% Furthermore , would she consider postponing decisions until people have had an opportunity to find their feet under the new system ? #% However , we have to deal with the issue of comitology . #% Madame President , many colleagues have approached me about misunderstandings relating to signing-in yesterday . #% I want to protest very strongly about this . #% Surely , that is the possibility of a citizens ' Europe ! #% In addition , employees of the institutions called on to testify must speak ` in accordance with the instructions from their administrations and shall continue to be bound by their duty of professional secrecy ' . #% We must adopt alternative fuels - biodiesel , fuel cells , gas and electric cars . #% Instead , a diverse coalition was able to exploit unfounded fears , resulting in its rejection and untold harm being inflicted on Ireland 's position within the EU and damaging our relations with applicant states . #% Would you not accept that dealing with problems that threaten their safety and wellbeing in a coordinated and comprehensive way will help convince them of the values of Europe ? #% Commercial services are one thing , but core public services , like social housing and welfare provision , are something quite different and should not be the plaything of profit-driven providers . #% I believe that an acceptance of this agreement would be an indication of normality and cooperation and as my colleague Mrs McNally said , this is not a normal country , it is not a normal situation , and it should not be endorsed . #% I have been indicating for quite some time - well before many people who have already spoken - that I want to make a point of order . #% I agree with it -- it is a good piece of legislation -- with the sole exception of the inclusion of solar radiation . #% This is the situation in many countries as a result of the legislation has been brought in under the guise of combating terrorism . #% A priority must be the fight against poverty and social exclusion and in particular the discouragement of the 18 million unemployed . #% There are a number of paragraphs that we have reservations about but , despite these reservations which we will probably revisit in subsequent discussions and debates on the issue , we will be voting in favour of this . #% I urge Members to support every amendment that retains freedom from patentability . #% Insofar as the POSEIMA programme is concerned , we have to admit that you could not think of a more complicated or indirect or inefficient way to aid islands or remote regions , because in the first place there is no guarantee whatsoever that this money is going to the aid of the people who need it or for whom it was intended . #% in writing . - I voted for this report as the situation in Ireland mirrors the problem experienced across Europe . #% The support provided to organic farming should be used to help open up new opportunities for the sector and to create an alternative to so-called conventional farming . #% This is clearly discrimination . #% First of all competitiveness of the European Union . #% Yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy . #% It is important that , in the transatlantic dialogue , we continue to champion the values and the desire for sustainability that we all share and believe in . #% A failure to do so would effect our attitude to their eventual accession . #% 
I salute what he says about the optimum desires for Cyprus and I hope the UN process will take off with his and others ' encouragement but we must remember never to make the best the enemy of the good . #% I hope that the situation will continue to be monitored and will continue to improve . #% Obviously , tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism , we in Northern Ireland are beginning , I am glad to say , to see a steady gain from increased tourism . #% Accounts can , of course , be harmonised , but harmonised accounts can then be adjusted for tax purposes in Member States and that is an issue for Member States . #% Mr President , Commissioner , I was honoured to be asked by Commissioner Patten to lead the EU electoral observation mission to Sri Lanka . #% Commissioner , considering the huge scale of citizenship granted over recent years in Bulgaria to immigrants from Moldova , Ukraine , Russia and elsewhere , what realistic steps will be taken to control that immigration by proxy through Bulgaria and Romania ? #% All too often in these architectural situations everybody goes by the textbook , and when you look and ask a disabled person afterwards what the textbook solution is like , firstly , invariably it is more expensive than what disabled people want themselves , and , secondly , it is actually not right for what they require themselves . #% But I have to ask a supplementary question . #% I want to ask you a number of questions relating to that . #% For all nations , but perhaps smaller nations in particular , cultural identity is very important . #% You have referred to the four dimensions in the Nice annex , the debate on competencies , the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments . #% Under the regulation establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture , the Commission is obliged to report at least every three years to Parliament , the Council and the Community bodies representing the sector on the implementation of measures and developments in the common fisheries policy . #% The Council is trying to wriggle out of its duty here . #% I also believe that we in the European Union must put our house in order . #% I regret that the President of this Parliament diminished his office by joining the left-wing herd in what , however it is dressed up , amounts to a denial of the Commission-designate 's right of freedom of thought and speech . #% Why should this be agreed in view of the recent economic expansion there ? #% It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo . #% in writing . - On a practical level I welcome the proposed developments for the long-term protection of marine resources , for both environmental and economic purposes ; the updating of fishing technologies , and the emphasis it places on the need for professional qualifications within the sector . #% I am sorry to say that , but that is the case . #% One of the most important aspects of this report that I want to raise is the whole issue of the distance of landfill sites from residential areas . #% I have urged this before , as an alternative to using a quota cut as a mechanism to control supply . #% Per annum , this will mean in practical terms a reduction in the overall annual budget for road safety campaigns from EUR 9.9 million to EUR 8 million . #% Finally , on the macro policy mix conducive to growth , employment and convergence , the Commission correctly referred to Article 105 ( 1 ) and let me quote it briefly : ' Monetary policy shall support the general economic policies of the European Union , including those concerning a high level of employment ' . #% Let us debate the political issues . #% A delegation of MEPs from various groups recently visited the Guantánamo Bay detention centre . #% The principle of cross-compliance , which means compliance with environmental and safety laws , is an important part of Parliament 's proposals . #% Women will be treated only by female doctors and men only by male doctors . #% We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns . #% In the UK , the British Jubilee Debt campaign are trying to mobilise politicians to support this . #% I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail . #% We can all , at times , excuse an occasional argument or even an accidental slap that might be given . #% While acknowledging Commissioner Fischler 's concern and efforts in modifying regulations to ease the burden for farmers , the reality is that beef , sheep and pigs are being sold at a loss or at best at marginal profits . #% We need some radical thinking and radical action . #% However , for many years , through the E111 form or other forms , we have had an agreement with regard to the ability to deliver services to people who are unwell when they are away from their home Member State . #% However , on another issue : I should like to know under what criteria you agree to meet certain demonstrators who come here to Strasbourg ? #% However , I have some concerns regarding the amount of legislation sought by this report and the move towards creating more bureaucracy and red tape , which could work to the detriment of the ideals underlying the social policy agenda . #% However , it is not clear yet to what extent companies have implemented this legislation . #% Mr President , next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , when the European Economic Community called for the abolition of the obstacles to the free movement of persons , goods , services and capital as the main objectives towards achieving a common or internal market . #% Could I ask Members to put that consideration out of their minds . #% If we have the partial reforms that the Commissioner is proposing here today , and we carry those out in opening up the market to grey trade supermarkets , in particular Internet sales , is it not the case that the block exemption becomes obsolete , and when will the day be when we actually get rid of these rules ? #% Shop shelves are full of low value , perishable goods that have been transported tens of thousands of miles to satisfy consumer pricing expectations . #% We must replace fluorinated gases with safer alternatives and take real action towards stopping their release into the environment . #% There is a link - MOX shipments to Japan are under EU safeguards controls . #% So we need to take proactive measures in regard to this . #% Robert McCartney was in the wrong place at the wrong time but this was no minor bar room brawl , as some have disgracefully attempted to portray it . #% I would like the Commissioner herself to state what exactly she did or did not say . #% Mr President , I welcome this directive and thank the rapporteur for his hard work . #% Afghanistan 's vast opium fields are feeding a multi-million dollar drugs business . #% This time there has been no suspension and good sense has prevailed on both sides . #% There are common policies to encourage our development . #% The government of national unity , which was set up in 2009 to bring about democracy , is obviously not working , due to his efforts to ensure that it does not . #% Mr McCreevy has of course always opposed that model . #% Following on from that , my second and final point is that if this European Union is to mean anything , if the new treaty on European Union is to mean anything , it must protect those who are most vulnerable in our society , and that is our children . #% It is high time that strong sanctions were imposed . #% The Commission must come up with appropriate negotiation proposals . #% Listening to the debate here today , I am somewhat reminded of 9/11 and the bombings in Madrid and London . #% The harvesting of egg cells poses serious risks to the health of the women involved , owing to hyper-stimulation of the ovaries . #% We must also endeavour to ensure full implementation of the directives . #% People here praise the Amsterdam Treaty for the fact that now human rights will be brought into the treaties . #% If I had to point to one single factor that has contributed more than any other to the turnaround in the Irish economy , I would have to cite the Social Partners ' Agreement which allowed us to trade competitively in the single market and to attract inward investment because of the stability it brought to wage negotiations . #% Subject : Iceland 's application to join the European Union #% I fully support the right of the Palestinian population to self-determination and their right to defend themselves against the repeated attacks of the Israeli army and state forces . #% It is a recipe for a bureaucratic nightmare with zero safety gains . #% In summary , the European Parliament will support new energy and ecotaxes , but does not support more taxes . #% I recall interviewing a feed compounder at that time who had no idea where most of his ingredients were coming from , because the word traceability had not been invented . #% I see this as the thin end of the wedge to force a common European tax policy on Ireland . #% 
In fact , I believe that the European Union , together with the United Nations , should continue to work to build peace and reconciliation on the island of Cyprus . #% A once prosperous country has been ruined and destroyed . #% That is a matter the Commission , and specifically the Commissioner responsible for the budget of the European schools , has to address . #% Firstly , let me say that in spite of the hurried nature of this debate , I welcome the fact that it is taking place . #% For me , however , it is a question of injured people and their families . #% What we have seen is a brutal regime taking a terrible revenge on a small country that dared to say it wanted to be independent and we must support it . #% I also referred to the misuse of technology , such as the Internet by paedophiles . #% in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution because of the importance of tackling Alzheimer 's disease in Europe . #% The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of all States worldwide , and the European Union is correct to restate its deep commitment to bringing the treaty into force at the earliest opportunity possible . #% The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees . #% I would suggest that we need reform , and we all agree on that . #% For instance , in areas such as autism , polio , cancer - breaking down the individual cancers is probably easier to collate than anything else - cystic fibrosis and other generic and genetic diseases , we have seen continuing problems for people trying to give services to sufferers . #% We need rules and regulations to ensure that Europe works properly not only for the consumer or business but , most importantly of all , for the citizens we govern . #% I understand that from the period from 1994 to 1999 , ECU 226.487 million were available to the UK to use for marketing and processing . #% The last point that I would like to make is with regard to 3G . #% These people should be brought to justice . #% So much for the Lisbon mission . #% I would just like to say that I propose to raise this matter with the Bureau this evening . #% I do not see how anyone in this House could actually support the use of EU funds - EU taxpayers ' money , that is - to allow shipowners to escape controls and then fish in competition with law-abiding shipowners . #% Mr President , Commission proposals for a mid-term reform of the common agricultural policy have led to a very difficult debate . #% The report points the finger at Islam , fostering discrimination and undermining respect for different religions and cultures . #% I am involved in several amendments . #% The task of making the nominations and appointment is reserved exclusively to a Board of Directors of the Bank , which is a quite separate body . #% I want to thank the Commission and my colleagues for highlighting the terrible ills that face us in the world and for trying to raise awareness of the appalling vista that lies ahead . #% European Community policies have promoted the development of the sheepmeat industry , but wool is another product that it is possible to develop and add value to . #% The PSE Group has therefore tabled an amendment asking the Commission to work in consultation with consumer groups and industry to ensure the clear and unambiguous execution of the information requirements . #% Mr President , I wish to put firmly on the record tonight that the farmers in Northern Ireland are exceedingly angry at the UK Government for not seeking European funding to help promote beef labelling . #% We must do so , however , in an enlightened and informed way and be prepared to avail ourselves of modern research and technology in achieving this objective . #% That is why the nuclear industry has to be more careful than other industries . #% For example , tens of millions of migrant workers lead lives of shameful misery , with their children suffering the consequences of the horrific conditions under which they live . #% I would invite him to visit Northern Ireland and the border countries and to see the situation for himself . #% The EU 's humanitarian policy is the practical expression of its commitment to supporting people in need of assistance when they are at their most vulnerable . #% However , I agree with the Commissioner that the answer is not , as the PPE-DE Group has proposed , to delete those requirements and , like the Commission , we will be voting against those deletions . #% We should be wearing them every day for the victims of these killer diseases . #% The European Union and all democratic societies in the world should join together with the United States in seeking to bring to justice those guilty of those atrocities and in doing so , ensure that they target the actual terrorist organisations and their members , not the communities in which they live with the danger of innocent people suffering . #% Through their pain , sorrow and search for justice they have united people across countries and political divides , including those who have had no involvement in any form of politics but can empathise with the pain and suffering of a family . #% In the Netherlands we have Mr Morales-Gouvenne and in Austria we have Noël Dumont . #% Opium farmers are earning ten times as much as the policemen or soldiers whose task it is to enforce the law against growing opium . #% I am sure the honourable Member who placed the question heard me quite clearly say how much I wanted to see the IRA cease-fire restored , how much I condemn the IRA activity , and that I did share with him and welcomed the Loyalist cease-fire . #% The Council of Ministers and the individual states are the people with the ultimate responsibility . #% Its separation from other EU norms is also highlighted by Euratom having its own framework for its research programme . #% In February , the European Court of Justice ruled that waste incineration in municipal waste incinerators could not be counted as a form of recovery , even if energy was generated as a result . #% With such a high uptake , it is clear that more European red tape on top of the current legislation is unnecessary in the UK . #% However , when the banks came begging , most governments , including the Irish Government , were only too quick to provide them with billions in taxpayers ' money . #% New contracts in other Member States will help to bring that prospect about and are therefore to be welcomed . #% Some years ago , the Chief Rabbi in Britain , Jonathan Sachs , wrote a book called . #% I urge Members , therefore , to vote for the agreed negotiated package that is before us today at first reading . #% We should also have the humility to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five-year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were . #% However , these European Union Treaties guarantee that the Union can operate effectively for the time being . #% On the European arrest warrant I would endorse what Mr MacCormick has said . #% My report also raises the issue of sub-prime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of sub-prime lending . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to participate in this historic debate and I look forward to the day , which is now just around the corner , when the representatives of each of the candidate countries will exercise their full rights as Members of this House and in each of the institutions of the European Union . #% Suggestions , for example , that export refunds should be ended , would have disastrous consequences , particularly for Ireland where we export up to 90 percent of our entire agricultural production . #% Along with my two colleagues from Northern Ireland , I recently brought a representative of a company in Northern Ireland to meet Commission officials about a new product which can significantly reduce emission levels now , with the additional benefit of reducing overall fuel consumption . #% Finally , is the ECB in favour of abolishing these coins as a positive move for the future ? #% I believe the rapporteur is correct to criticise certain Member States for failing to supply adequate data . #% We will not accept second best any more . #% Sexual and reproductive health and rights need to be acknowledged and furthered in Europe and at a global level . #% There is a real fear that what is happening at the WTO will mean the death knell for many farmers , not just in Ireland , but throughout the European Union . #% We can not wait for a cooperation that will not come . #% I hope that all of us have learned this lesson from the events of the last year . #% Our concern must be for those we represent : customers both commercial and - the majority of us - domestic . #% The Spring Summit will also focus on the Lisbon Agenda and I welcome the presidency 's proposal to give renewed impetus to the reform goals agreed at Lisbon . #% From the institutional point of view , I repeat the question : why has the Council , even in the preamble to its recommendations , made no reference to Parliament 's opinions ? #% I would like the President-in-Office to reaffirm his commitment to continue this kind of process to find the best way of ensuring that people know exactly what we do and what we do not do at European level . #% He has to go eight miles before he can find a telephone to communicate with anybody . #% 
Firstly , with regard to sustainable tourism , obviously tourism is best dealt with where you have human populations . #% Considering that 80 % of all British nuclear waste is held in Sellafield and that it can process 5000 tonnes of waste per year -- about one third of the world 's waste -- and considering the serious questions about safety at this plant for many years and the number of accidents that have taken place , I would like to know what guarantees the British Government can give concerned parties and the people of Ireland that the highest safety standards will be met while this plant is being operated in private hands . #% Without genuine global cooperation , particularly from the world 's largest producer of greenhouse gases , the US , any agreement will be meaningless . #% Mr President , Commissioner , first I would like to say how truly thrilled I was to hear that the Belgian Presidency has made the issue of children 's rights part of its presidency programme . #% National interests are made totally subservient to what is perceived to be the EU 's overall interest . #% There are many other issues I would like to raise , including the Guantanamo prisoners and the appalling suffering of the Palestinian people , but time does not permit me to do so . #% I thank Mr Thomas for his report . #% We find ourselves now in the process of creating a new , minimum and acceptable European norm for the management of public affairs and Community institutions which does not permit cultural exceptionalism . #% Farmer privilege must be protected in this regard so as to protect the social and economic unit of the family farm throughout Europe . #% The European Union also has competence in environmental matters under Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty . #% It was with American aid that a shattered Europe was able to reconstruct and develop in the post war years . #% I would ask the Commission and the rapporteur to try and put in place a system of postal services that will be fair to all , a universal service . #% Experts from the EU accounting industry said that ` it could never happen in Europe ' , but then we had Parmalat , which had an audit committee -- as did Enron -- made up of eminent independent professors . #% This now assumes a new urgency by going to the heart of the kind of Union we wish the applicant states to join . #% I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deny that recent events in East Timor were totally predictable and therefore to some extent preventable . #% We must now support that in whatever way we can . #% Mr President , like other colleagues , I too welcome the opportunity for this debate even though I would vehemently disagree with some of those who propose support for this resolution . #% I would like to highlight certain amendments for support : Amendment No 11 which clarifies that certificates issued before the directive enters into force would remain valid ; Amendment No 21 which provides that only countries complying with the STCW Convention should receive recognition and Amendment No 22 , which proposes a definitive period for Member States to implement these proposals . #% But the IAEA are now trying to do the same thing to others as they did to the children with thyroid cancer : they are effectively denying these people screening and treatment . #% in writing . - The European Social Fund ( ESF ) is the EU 's main budgetary instrument to help social and labour market integration . #% The resolution also calls on the EU High Representative and Member States to actively monitor the implementation of recommendations included in the Goldstone report by means of consultation of EU external missions and NGOs in the field and calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with all parties , as well as EU positions in multilateral fora . #% The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union . #% In my view , the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security . #% Without that , the clear underlying economic message in today 's report is that Italy would fail to meet a condition sine qua non . #% There are other ways of trying to influence the situation and the Council is doing everything in its power to use those avenues . #% On 6 November they reported that the Chilean Supreme Court had ordered Mrs Marin 's release within a day of her arrest and that General Pinochet had been persuaded that this was probably not the best way to approach this issue . #% I understand that the Irish Government has recently responded to a letter from the Commission requesting clarification on the role and financing of public service broadcasting in Ireland . #% I would also appeal to Member States to spend the funds which are there to spend and not to continue with the increasing underspending and delays and bureaucracy . #% This is certainly a very contentious issue in my own area of Dublin . #% This regulation before us has the objective of applying these rights against the EU institutions : Parliament , the Council , the Commission , the ECJ , the European Investment Bank , . #% Furthermore , trading insults across the Atlantic serves no purpose , and only makes matters worse . #% It is clear that the issue of tax harmonisation is not high on the agenda of the work of the Convention . #% I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace . #% From this , however , some good could come . #% I can assure the last speaker that this is not simply an issue of interest to the Portuguese . #% The six Commissioners with whom we had dealings satisfied us as to their future competence in the roles which they will undertake . #% I have tabled certain amendments . #% Basically , my problem is that I had questions down - as some other people did - to Commissioner Byrne . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate and to put on record -- not for the first time -- my concern regarding the ethical guidelines for research funding . #% I would like to focus in particular on the SME sector and on the kind of supports that we can put into place at Community , national level and at local level . #% I am not well-informed on the facts of the matter but my impression was that his intervention was based on verifiable facts rather than simply issues of political preference . #% We should now be generous enough to take our share of those fleeing persecution and those seeking to make a better life for themselves . #% Mr President , while welcoming the programme presented to us today I must express some alarm that on page 12 , under ` Key initiatives - sustainable and inclusive economy ' , the mountain has laboured and made a promise to produce a green paper on public services or services of economic interest . #% This seems to be very much in relation to the fact that the Vietnamese are trying to modernise and the modernisation costs are being basically borne by the peasant farmers . #% Firstly , from the environmental viewpoint , the use of varieties which genetic alteration has made more resistant to soil-borne and air-borne diseases has drastically reduced the need for herbicides , fungicides and other chemical plant protection product which leave very damaging residues in the soil . #% I want a strict enforcement of the Community control system with regard to third country vessels operating within EU waters . #% I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families . #% It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes . #% It is to be time-limited legislation . #% Equally , there is an urgent need to moderate the language of politics in Northern Ireland . #% I thank them for their statements to the House . #% Mr Belder has adopted a commendable analytical approach and is looking ahead , taking advantage of this particular moment in time when change looks more possible that it has hitherto . #% As long as there is room for improvement in this area , it is incumbent on us , as European legislators , to push forward and bring about a better set of conditions . #% There must be maximum cooperation between the EU Member State governments and all interested bodies so that a reduction in the use of CO2 becomes a reality in the very near future . #% You said that those comments were not correct . #% We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States . #% These ideas can be used by all to further the science and to drive progress . #% For agriculture as a whole - $ 49.8 billion in 2006 - the Court found a marked reduction in the estimated overall level of error . #% There are a couple of things we should focus on more than we have done . #% A sustained campaign by lobbyists financially supported by Smith-KlineBeecham misrepresented and misinformed MEPs about the patients ' organizations . #% We also tabled the amendment to require the Commission to come forward with a study in this area . #% It is to be regretted that some people used the debate on food safety to undermine the profession of farming and the role of farmers as guarantors of a quality food supply for citizens . #% I am sent here by people to ask questions . #% Both sides agreed that meetings would be held twice a year . #% Even though horses are not initially reared for human consumption , they do end up in the human food chain . #% We should ensure that where we are protecting services or markets we do not oblige other countries which are less able to do battle in the open market to start up services that will simply sink or become private monopolies owned outside their own state . #% 
How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged . #% The other point I want to bring into this is the lack of dialogue between the different institutions and the operators themselves . #% The European Parliament 's Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy has voted on the liberalisation directives for gas and electricity and we have reached the conclusion that if liberalisation takes place without paying attention to the environmental , consumer and social consequences , you are embarking on a dangerous journey . #% I have no fears that what is being suggested is wild and savage liberalisation because we have insisted on regulation unbundling , public service guarantees and labelling for environmental impact which leads to informed choice by customers . #% Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force , I do not want to exaggerate its importance . #% I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading . #% Freedom can never be given away . #% It is either a single market or it is not . #% It has been clearly stated that no other country has a right to exploit the Saharawi resources without the permission of the Saharawi people . #% It shows that the Union is currently working with other international organisations to deal with the discard problem . #% How can we claim that our ingredients are local if they are all modified in a laboratory ? #% Mr President , pursuant to the implementation of the Nitrates Directive , the agricultural sector in my constituency , as elsewhere , is being subjected to extensive capital expenditure for the purpose of radically increasing slurry storage capacity . #% This will not serve the best interests of our poorest communities , with deliberate misinformation and hijacking this debate for narrow party political advantage . #% in writing . - Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women . #% I for one will not lend the veneer ... #% They must be able to innovate , write and develop lines of code and produce software processes without violating or breaking patent law . #% If this is true , it is in breach of the Association Agreement . #% What I will be calling for - and I am hopeful that the Commission will take this on board - is for the basic principles of customer care to be enshrined in clearly communicated legislation that is uniformly understood and simple . #% But it can not be if we stand by and pay lip service to a despot like Mugabe , who is not only destroying his country and his people , but ensuring that the aid that is given does not even reach those who really need it . #% It is a unique problem which requires a unique response . #% Secondly , as an Irish Member , I am indeed very pleased that the workers in Dell who have been made redundant at least now have an opportunity to look forward and to plan for the future . #% This is positive and should , in my view , be fully supported . #% The Americans must not be allowed to call for an end to export refunds while they continue to operate a host of schemes which have exactly the same effect as far as American farmers are concerned . #% I am speaking today wearing a number of hats : firstly , as the surrogate father of this report ; secondly , as the draftsperson of the opinion ; and most importantly , as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship , employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights . #% Are our rules and regulations concerning animal movement and animal traceability all that they should be ? #% As Irish republicans , following in the tradition of Bobby Sands MP , we are committed to the politics of equality , justice and freedom . #% Analysis of test data is carried out on an on-going basis by a special TB investigation unit . #% In the field of defence , regardless of what common policy elements are adopted , I believe that Member States will continue to play different roles . #% Our group will be supporting this report . #% Are the inspection procedures and sampling arrangements at import points into the Union adequate ? #% The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about . #% Its denial in China is not something we can ignore to facilitate trade with a state that persecutes Christian people , whatever the mutual economic benefits might be . #% I suggest that will be inoperable and unenforceable . #% Consequently , the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses . #% Ever since the opposition to the THORP nuclear plant in 1993 , the level of radioactive discharges from nuclear operations in Cumbria has substantially increased . #% I urge that we in this House keep the pressure on to ensure that this facility is made available to the poorest of the poor . #% It is in all our interests that a multilateral framework be put in place to govern the trading relations of the 150 different members of the WTO at this time . #% Increased worker participation helps to achieve a happier , more highly motivated and more productive workforce . #% He has already offered an average cut of 46 % , which will apply to import tariffs , although there was a clear understanding that the 1999 and 2003 CAP reforms were in preparation for cuts of 36 % . #% As the House knows , the Ecofin Council this year , on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes , issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year 's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy . #% The renewal of the SAVE programme may be timely as the European Commission reports that the carbon dioxide target is being exceeded by 5 % . #% But one must ask the question if that was the intention , are they the ones currently benefiting ? #% We have a responsibility to play our part in ensuring that there is a smooth transition to the Sixth Programme . #% In many ways over 60-plus years the UN has accomplished this vital mandate . #% We not only did that but we sent back money every year which we saved with good budgetary policy . #% The European Structural Funds have played a considerable role in helping less-developed and peripheral nations to prepare the completion of the Single Market , and in the introduction of the European single currency . #% With regard to the Middle East , the most important lesson for us of the last six months has been our failure to speak properly , with a single voice , and to give a clear message to all those countries -- whatever they try -- that if they do something wrong , action will be taken by the European Union against them . #% It is quite clear that there is no international legality for the invasion and current occupation of Iraq . #% The RETT committee amendments are in line with the conclusions of the Musotto report , particularly on the need for a cohesion policy which will improve existing and future disparities between European regions in an enlarged Europe . #% It is important that the European Parliament has the necessary budget to properly fulfil the mandate which has been given to it from the European people . #% Let us encourage women . #% Of course the consumer is always right , but on this occasion the European Union legislators have had to redouble their efforts to improve the safety of the food chain in Europe and to restore consumer confidence in food products within the Union . #% A whole family was wiped out by these bombings , as shown in Mr Pilger 's documentary . #% The EU has competence over matters such as telecommunications , transport and energy , but it does not have competence under the EU Treaties to legislate in a broad capacity on matters governing the operation of social services , health and education within the different Member States . #% As for the detail of the WTO proposal , what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States . #% The third option put forward by the Commission , developing the 1992 approach , has positive elements since it involves the development of an integrated rural policy . #% Has the time not come to be more robust and to consider sanctions in trade , if that is necessary and is the only thing that will deliver implementation of human rights ? #% Madam President , reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process . #% Would he also ensure that all other Member States remove such toys from their shelves before this Christmas ? #% What sort of a precedent is this setting for other mavericks in the near neighbourhood of Europe , if somebody who threatens nuclear development , makes xenophobic comments about a nearby state and threatens international security is to get a package ? #% Mr President , I should like to refer briefly to the importance of forestry from a rural development as well as a family-farm perspective . #% Time for deliberation will be needed if we are to address the complex issues and concerns which arose during the referendum debate . #% I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it . #% If accepted by the Council and actually implemented by fishermen , they will doubtless result in fewer juvenile fish and nontargeted species being caught and discarded . #% These questions must be fully explored and a watching brief should be maintained by the Parliament in relation to these developments and trends in media ownership in Ireland and across the EU . #% We need people who have been disenfranchised in the areas of science and technology - women , older people and particularly those suffering disadvantage - to be on board in the quest for this wider knowledge . #% 
We have been in correspondence but I am raising the matter because I do not feel that I or this Parliament have received a proper answer . #% Mr President , as from January 1999 , the euro has been the new currency for most of the European Union . #% But the Council rejected much of that advice . #% In his discussions with the Italian presidency and the incoming Irish presidency , has he had any commitments from them that it will also be a priority for the Council ? #% We need urgently to examine why our response is always - as I said yesterday and others said today - too little , too late . #% This system has obvious uses in the fields of air and sea transport and can also be used in road transport . #% It is for others to justify why they endorsed it . #% For those reasons I am obliged to say that I can not support this report , although I readily acknowledge the genuine motivations the rapporteur had in bringing it forward . #% It does not matter whether you come from Galicia , it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland . #% Clearly this proposal is out of touch with current agricultural realities . #% We urge the Commission to move as quickly as possible to amend the necessary regulation , to allow extrapolation , the use of passports for horses and to resolve the problem . #% Who could have forecast 60 years ago where we all are now ? #% I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city , where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe . #% But again this was not taken up by the committee or by the Arias Cañete report . #% I think that the message this Parliament will give today by voting through these new measures is that we want goods to move freely , we want to increase competition and consumer choice , but we will not compromise on safety and , therefore , we have stepped up enforcement surveillance and given the CE mark the legal protection it deserves , to ensure that importers and manufacturers can be legally prosecuted if they fail in their duty of responsibility to protect the consumer . #% Our years of dependence on fossil fuels have left us with two stark conclusions : #% However , once this had been resolved , the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe , plus Cyprus and Malta , to join in 2004 . #% It has been imposed upon them that they can not fish for about an 11 to 12 week period . #% As it is currently proposed , CCCTB would mean the redistribution of European profits across the EU , so a country like Ireland , which exports a lot of what it produces , would be penalised because the profits , of course , would be at the point of sale . #% We all know that we must put in place a new European Union treaty , if the European Union is to modernise and become more effective in a Community of 25 Member States . #% UN drugs officials in Afghanistan are calling for balanced measures that encourage farmers to find alternative income and increase the legal risk to anyone involved in the trade . #% Angling has a long and important heritage in the east of Ireland , with scenes of anglers at rivers such as the Slaney or on the shores of the east coast a popular depiction of Irish culture . #% There is a danger in going out to the citizens of the European Union and saying to them that Maastricht was about unemployment , the single currency is about unemployment and then saying - if we fail - that Europe has failed us and let us down . #% Finally , President Prodi , I ask you to read today 's , which carries an interview with you on the occasion of your visit to Ireland yesterday . #% Equally , in relation to sheepmeat , important to European , and particularly Irish , farmers - badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods . #% It is lax in the extreme that the hospital which is located near the biggest concentration of chemicals factories in Ireland has no decontamination unit for treating chemicals workers or members of the public who fall victim to major accidents . #% We , more than most nations , have benefited from the generosity of spirit and kindness of other nations in our history , most notably Britain , Australia and the United States of America . #% I welcome the Commission 's support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn . #% There has been a general breakdown in the computer network and it lasted five minutes due to defective hardware . #% The Chernobyl disaster changed the public perception of nuclear energy , and many of those who live in the shadow of nuclear power plants are apprehensive about current levels of safety . #% These draft amendments would certainly seem to contravene Lithuania 's obligations under its own Constitution , the European Charter of Fundamental Rights , the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . #% It is no secret that in some countries politicians and the police are profiting from people-trafficking and tipping traffickers off when operations are about to be mounted against them . #% I can not understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I can not understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50 % self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information , that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk . #% We have now added to that list the ongoing humanitarian plight of thousands of displaced East Timorese as a result of the well-planned and systematic policy of killings , destruction of property , and intimidation carried out by the militia and elements of the Indonesian security forces . #% The EU should financially support that endeavour . #% Is it Euratom ? #% In spite of the scathing references of many Eurosceptics , I do not claim this draft Constitution to be the Holy Grail or the Second Coming , but it is a positive step forward for Europe and one that I will support . #% I voted in support of this report despite some misgivings and concern with the overall thrust of the report . #% in writing . - I voted to reject Amendment 20 , second part ; Amendment 69 , second part , as this had been recommended by both S&D voices on the Culture Committee , on which I sit as a substitute member . #% In terms of jobs and services , these are areas which could really ignite economies throughout Europe at the moment , given that tourism is one of the growing areas . #% Let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further European integration . #% If we are to maximize the full potential of Europe 's agricultural resources , we must add value to the greatest possible extent to the indigenous resources of rural areas . #% In the exchange of agriculture for services , Irish sugar beet farmers have lost their crop , and we have now lost the last of our sugar factories , in Mallow , in my own constituency , which closed just two weeks ago . #% It is probably true to say that every single Member of this House has had some experience of the kinds of problems faced by ordinary passengers and it is good that we are now dealing with this issue . #% I would also ask this House to criticize the acknowledged five nuclear powers for setting a bad example and in particular for the nuclear test in Mururoa some time ago . #% It could assist in aiding market access for businesses , by supporting the role of the single point of contact for businesses to get into the single market in services , known as the ` one-stop shop ' . #% A lot of mention has been made within the report and by colleagues speaking here tonight , and I am sure the Commissioner will also touch on it , about the importance of lifelong learning and education . #% The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents . #% A new approach is required that uses diplomacy and politics instead of force . #% I have always thought of myself as an Irish Republican , as indeed do the McCartney family . #% Madam President , in relation to Iraq I have swung from anger , through despondency , to determination . #% It is frightening to hear President Prodi say that almost 80 % of respondents in a recent poll had no idea what was going on . #% Anyone who has watched the way in which Mrs van den Burg has worked on this directive will appreciate the enormous amount of commitment and expertise that had to be brought to it . #% That is understood by Parliament 's Committee on Budgets and I want to emphasize here tonight that every effort was made , particularly by the chair of that committee , to help in the process of obtaining more money for research . #% I fear that if the regulations proposed in this directive were to be applied those consumers in poorer areas would end up with no credit unions and no option but to turn to loan sharks . #% Mr President , the sole purpose of this resolution is to achieve justice for the McCartney family -- whom I welcome here this evening -- by insisting that normal policing and judicial procedures be allowed to take their course in relation to the murder of their brother Robert . #% The purpose of the SBA has been to reduce the administrative burden of doing business and improve access to finance for SMEs . #% The Commission will be assisted in its work by a committee made up of representatives of Member States . #% To ask the Election Commission to investigate election malpractice is like asking Saddam Hussein to head the UN weapons inspection team in Iraq . #% Israeli and Palestinian leaders have met and this can be seen as a first step on the long road to peace and reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples . #% Mr President , with your permission and having discussed this with Mrs Hassi , who tabled this amendment , and indeed my colleague Mrs Corbey of the PSE Group , I would like colleagues to consider a very brief oral amendment . #% My understanding is that the spring summit instructed the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a framework for services of a general interest by the end of this year . #% This House is not going to accept that once the glare of publicity leaves South-East Asia , the commitments we make now will not be met . #% So our aim is multi-faceted , we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries , but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture . #% We have proved we can farm salmon and shellfish to the highest standards , taking all the necessary precautions to ensure good environmental practices . #% I am delighted that you have been so realistic as to describe the cuts as drastic , because that is all they can be described as . #% 
I hope the Irish government will invest sufficient time in explaining the Treaty accurately and sincerely to all our citizens the second time around . #% I had no contact with her but I separately put down a motion for my own group and I speak on their behalf on this subject . #% That is why limiting the categories of offences to 32 was a good idea in the initial stage . #% We really have to do something more than just adopting resolutions . #% Some 30 000 people per year in western Europe , North America , Japan and Australia die from asbestos exposure . #% Dover and Wexford are only two examples of what is to come . #% This is the worst we have heard of to date but we understand there are amputations taking place in Nigeria for relatively minor offences . #% The Commission , for its part , has supported Turkish NGOs and professional organizations promoting human rights for a number of years , including the Human Rights Association , the Human Rights Foundation and the Turkish Medical Association . #% The Commission 's paper acknowledges that , even though standardisation of most mental health instruments has been completed through many studies , definition of mental health states is one of the most difficult tasks . #% If Member State governments will not provide this , we should reduce the amount of money they receive under the Socrates programme and other education programmes . #% One of the key legislative organs is the European Commission , which has the power to initiate the enactment of directives and regulations . #% I call on Parliament to demand the immediate end of this illegal war . #% There is great potential here for an expression of will from Parliament . #% in writing . - At the heart of the financial crisis were banks taking excessive risks and failing to hold enough capital to cover those risks . #% The recent application by BNFL to the British Government for increased area discharges is another unpleasant episode in the ongoing saga of Sellafield and Thorp nuclear plants . #% Mr President , I should like to point out to the Commissioner that the Irish Government has mass-medicated my people with disodium monofluorophosphate for 40 years . #% The livelihoods of many of my constituents are dependent on the marine sector and a coherent safety policy for all facets of maritime transport is an urgent necessity . #% We should not set up unfair barriers to their accession . #% There will be the Apprentice Boys ' March on 12 August in Derry . #% I would like to point out that 70 Congressmen sent a letter to Bill Clinton in the United States asking him to lift the embargo , asking him to de-link economic sanctions from the military sanctions that are currently in place in Iraq . #% There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions . #% Our farmers are now the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control , and the Commission must give practical recognition to their economic plight . #% But we must also ensure that small software developers are not faced with a minefield of trivial patents . #% In part , the Santer Commission , ironically , has become a victim of its own willingness to examine fraud and corruption within the Commission . #% We were told that the EEAS would be budget-neutral . #% It is very clear from this letter that the UK Government does not want any involvement of social partners or the issue of social partnership . #% Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform . #% What happened in South-East Asia indicates how urgent this is , and the Commission should now be trying to work for some sort of a treaty base to compel Member States to meet this commitment of 0.7 % . #% The President-in-Office is aware that in Florence we had political endorsement of the Santer Confidence Pact but we did not have any financial endorsement . #% However , before a date can be set for the commencement of negotiations for entry , further proof must be forthcoming that this reform programme is being implemented . #% Closer coordination between the Commission and Member States is needed and Parliament therefore supports the development of joint strategy papers . #% By addressing the issue of impunity and providing a fair forum for prosecutions , the court will help ease international tensions and promote peace and security , domestically and internationally . #% We are all aware of the current difficulties faced by farmers . #% However , splitting hairs over decimal points on the budget last weekend has put Europe 's ambitious Seventh Framework Programme for doubling funding on research on ice . #% Undoubtedly , substantial progress has been made in increasing the independence , transparency and efficiency of public administrations in the applicant countries , as well as in improving the operation of their legal systems . #% It has established a coordination group to ensure the prompt and effective implementation at political level of decisions concerning all elements of the relationship between Canada and the European Union . #% The effect of TB in these countries is exacerbated by the fact that it is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads easily within confined spaces such as the squalid shanty towns so prevalent in many developing nations . #% Therefore , it is essential for us now to come up with a balanced approach as to how best protect the intellectual property rights of the creators . #% Technical fixes are not enough . #% Mr President , firstly we all know national provisions on safety training for cabin crew vary widely across the European Union . #% In conclusion , the most important and effective weapon we have is the Association Agreement . #% Most importantly of all , if history has taught us anything - through the example of the establishment of the European Union or conflict resolution in other areas of the European continent - it is that only by having better and closer relations with our neighbours can we achieve what can truly be called a just and lasting peace . #% This is the price we pay for the policy of seeking to maintain the population of the European Union in the rural areas . #% In particular I am looking at people who are at risk , whether because of social problems and their lack of access to formal education , or because of dropping out of formal education and getting involved in crime and other activities . #% Air transport is vital to the EU 's economy , accounting for up to 8 % of GDP , boosting productivity , attracting investment and encouraging tourism . #% This includes a range of issues including the extension of qualified majority voting at Council level , the re-weighting of votes in the Council , the extension of codecision measures to the European Parliament and the reform of the European Commission . #% However , I would like to see a bottom line which can give some sort of hope to the disadvantaged regions and the fishing communities . #% Mr President , the Danish Presidency is indeed to be congratulated on its skilful handling of the negotiations which resulted in a successful outcome to the two-day summit in Brussels . #% We are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership . #% Fiscal discipline and retrenchment must not take the place of a job stimulus plan , yet that is happening in many countries , including my own , Ireland . #% We are all disappointed at the rate of progress in the negotiations for the trade cooperation and development agreement with South Africa but it is important that the end result of the negotiations is an agreement which is beneficial to the long-term interest of both parties to these negotiations . #% Those speaking on behalf of retailers and consumers take one view , whereas those in relation to producers have another view . #% Madam President , I want to thank the rapporteur , the Commissioner and other colleagues who are here tonight . #% I support economic coordination , but everybody playing in the same pitch must play according to the same economic rules . #% This is relevant . #% We have achieved our 2001 target of recycling 25 % of packaging and we are well on our way to achieving the 2005 target of a 50 % recycling rate thanks to proper , sensible timelines and derogations . #% Even the fishing industry itself says that there is overcapacity and that reductions are necessary . #% All of these areas and , of course , the work you have undertaken with the European Parliament on enhancing transparency , should be recognised as matters of importance and substance . #% On alcohol , I wish to support compromise Amendment No 23 , the so-called linkage amendment explained by our colleague Mr Miller , to ensure the distortion should not get greater . #% I agree with Mr Evans about CITES-listed species . #% In conclusion , can I say that on a broader level it is important that the European Union , as an economic entity , does not fall behind in the global search for e-commerce opportunities . #% Mr President , I welcome the proposal to choose 1990 as the reference year . #% Most Iraqis do not see the Council as being responsible for the country 's administration and continue to blame the coalition for the many hardships they endure . #% The main thrust of this resolution is to call on the UN to set a clear date for deployment of the planned UN-supported peacekeeping force , or hybrid force , into Darfur , even in the absence of agreement with the Sudanese Government , in order to secure humanitarian aid corridors to an increasingly isolated population in the region . #% Mr Mulder makes the point in his report that the people who commit offences should have to pay for them . #% Would that humanity could only see the futility of such wars . #% 
Farm income in Ireland and many other Member States is very much dependent on the direct income support from the European Union budget . #% Mr President , with the agreement of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I should like to amend the wording of the new paragraph 2a to read : ' ... calls on the Saudi Arabian Government to lift restrictions on women 's free movement ( including the to drive ) - there is a change of word there - , on employment opportunities , on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial process ' . #% Not only because of my opposition to the grand design of which it is part but because it diminishes the protection of my constituents against unfairness , I oppose this proposal . #% We will certainly see a rise in Islamic fundamentalism and individual attacks on Western targets will continue unabated , even on a freelance basis , should this war take place . #% It has been in existence since the mid-1980s , and provides educational opportunities for students from within the European Union and the applicant states to study in different Member States . #% The implementation of the Wye River Accord seems likely to proceed . #% The forecast by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training ( Cedefop ) of growth of 80 million new jobs by 2020 is welcome . #% The police I met with are doing an excellent job and being assisted by new software technology designed again by a local company in my constituency , Surf Control . #% We as socialists are very supportive of the amendments put forward by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and others . #% They really are criminals who through negligence or through deliberate action are destroying the environment , affecting human health , affecting our flora and fauna and causing in many other ways long-term damage , all in the interest of profit . #% The emergence of BSE in the older animal group tends to undermine consumer confidence even if they are not destined for the food chain . #% They have now been submitted to Geneva to be considered , along with the proposals of the other members of the World Trade talks , including the United States , the Cairns Group and the developing countries . #% This particular initiative has been overtaken . #% It was not easy to decide on our tactics . #% It is not Boston versus Berlin , it is ensuring that we do what is right for all the people in Europe in the 21st century . #% I have three follow-up points in relation to what you have said . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Madam President , Commissioner , when we in Ireland signed up for economic and monetary union , we accepted the central tenet of economic and monetary union , namely closer coordination of economic and budgetary policies of Member States . #% A human development approach to debt sustainability with highly indebted countries would mean that the first call on poor countries ' government resources would be expenditures needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals . #% In the last few days , following many meetings , including briefings from UK ministers , we have seen some positive developments . #% Secondly , I hope there will be a minimum period between the Convention and the IGC . #% I can only hope that the Commission and the Spanish presidency acting together will begin to tackle this very important matter in the months ahead . #% I would like to seek an assurance from you , given what you did say , that in future Member States will take a strong stance in their discussions with China where the abuse of human rights are concerned and will not be blackmailed by any economic threats by China in this regard . #% The timetable in which Member States will produce their maps to DG IV predetermines potentially Objective 2 areas on the future structural fund map . #% Also , during our visit to the prison , the prison governor indicated quite clearly that these three men would not be safe in any prison in Colombia . #% The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one . #% I have studied this report and can see no reason to put in any amendments to it . #% Indeed , if Dublin II does not resolve these issues , why are we rushing them through this Parliament , in this debate , so as to accommodate the other institutions ? #% Health care and care of the elderly , whilst an important part of the overall health system , does not necessarily represent the overall health system . #% There is quite a lot of double-talk here tonight . #% The Sudanese Government has shown no willingness to protect internally displaced persons . #% I do not agree with the views of my colleague , Mr de Roo , in the specific amendments he has introduced on noise at airports and in the environs of airports in this piece of legislation . #% The current LIFE III programme is due to finish at the end of 2006 when a new package , LIFE + , will be introduced as part of our new Financial Perspective on which we await a Council decision . #% It is not acceptable that at one and the same time as we improve the quality of life internally within the European Union that some EU firms are breaching health and safety rules or exploiting labour and are causing serious and permanent damage to the environment in developing countries . #% At this stage in the procedure it will be up to us , the Members , to ensure that the participating nations get the best possible deal to ensure that they can continue and , in some cases complete , the ongoing good work in the environment and transport infrastructure . #% There must be a European-wide political agreement concerning the framework decision on the identification , seizure and confiscation of products of crime . #% That is the period in which Scottish and Irish fishermen sell a lot of their produce and the prices at the end of the year are extremely important to them . #% Some of the amendments tabled will not facilitate progress with this proposal which , I want to stress , should prepare the way for a humanitarian response to future situations which might arise where a mass influx of people in need of international protection takes place . #% The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults , yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers , who are teenagers . #% In my own country we currently have the shortest re-registration period , with only one day allowed . #% Madam President , having experienced not just the trauma of BSE but the very protracted and painful recovery until we recently secured the return of British beef exports , none of us wants to see that happen again . #% Finally , I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner himself . #% I very much welcome Mr Poos ' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament , as I believe it will , the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers . #% Amongst the many difficulties we are facing in this area is the very frequent refusal of courts from one Member State to recognize judgments made in another . #% However , I have in my possession a study carried out by University College , Dublin , which highlights the negative impact of this proposed extension of the directive , not only on the grounds of safety and competitiveness , but also on the grounds of damage to the environment . #% The fact of the matter is that the greater the use of Greenhouse Gases , the greater the effect that this has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities not only in Europe but world-wide . #% Earlier this year , we witnessed the appalling military assault on the area held by the Tamil Tigers , without any regard for the lives or well-being of citizens who , in my view , are used as pawns by all sides , resulting in 90 000 dead . #% So , there are those problems but by linking the human rights clause in this agreement and the non-execution clause we are provided with further leverage in pressing for observance of these rights . #% The LRA is only a small force , but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants . #% The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists . #% With the aviation industry set to lose upward of $ 1 billion as a result of the volcanic ash cloud , the EU must act quickly and decisively to ease the financial blow on the aviation industry . #% That side of the House should be thoroughly ashamed of their conduct in the Busquin hearing . #% Parliament , which is the budgetary authority , is being frustrated in its attempts to obtain the relevant scientific information on this major third country agreement . #% This must be the overriding consideration of European Union leaders as they search for agreement on the key aspects of future EU policies under the Agenda 2000 programme . #% What confidence can we have that the Commission will ensure that all Member States will comply and fulfil the commitments made in relation to reducing carbon ? #% I must say , however , that I am extremely disappointed with the industry 's lack of defence of their products and processes and , indeed , even their field trials , against unjustified scare stories . #% The rapporteur has advanced the options of charging Heavy Goods Vehicles ( HGVs ) for the pollution they cause and including noise pollution caused by rail transport under the provisions of the report . #% This also applies to the Commission proposal on POM , prescription only medicines . #% What strikes me about me about the Commission 's statement is that in a zone as large as the EMU , labour costs are generally considered as the main potential source of inflation . #% Regarding safety , the draft directive claimed that it would introduce common safety standards , but this directive , as drafted , does not set out those safety standards . #% If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it . #% I do not mind flexibility - that is good in politics - but this seems rather more chaotic than one 's definition of flexibility . #% Indeed our written constitution with protection for property rights has proved very difficult for the government to get over many of the issues in relation to designation of sites . #% We have had double-digit inflation in housing for some time and it looks like we will continue to have that . #% There has been no assessment of the social impact it will have , and no serious consultation with post office management , with employees or with consumers . #% On this occasion , I have been contacted by farming organisations , veterinary groups , agricultural co-operatives , pharmaceutical interests , health stores and numerous individual constituents . #% 
Under this directive , draconian regulations have been imposed on Northern Ireland . #% This is a supplementary point . #% The Commissioner has solidly justified the expenditure in relation to the Berlaymont . #% Indeed , every day I hear of job losses in the textile sector in the East Midlands which I represent and only last month I learned of another 350 jobs that have gone in a women 's clothing and child wear sector in Huthwaite in Nottinghamshire . #% I would say to Commissioner Kroes that competition is the objective , not the problem . #% Moreover , global standards on liquidity management are proposed . #% At present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security . #% Future ideas must be flexible and able to adapt to the new society . #% We failed to protect them . #% In a report produced by the European Liaison Committee for Social Housing to mark the United Nations Year of Older Persons , one of the main recommendations is that governments and service providers should help people to stay in their own communities as they get older . #% With Chinese arms exports - some of them in the attack that was described a minute ago - estimated to be in excess of USD 2 billion a year , the irresponsibility with which they act has to be called into question . #% That is my one criticism still that , in this respect , we want to go it alone in Europe , rather than operate a worldwide basis in relation to this . #% That is a view shared by many in this House and also one shared by many European Union governments . #% We need to create dynamic cities that respect people and the environment and involve community groups in the planning and process and in regeneration processes as such . #% We all know what the answer to that is , so the Syrian troops must be swiftly withdrawn . #% Despite the fact that landfill is considered the least-favoured option for waste disposal in Europe , Ireland comes top of the EU list for using landfill to dispose of its huge waste mountains . #% Mr President , I think it is a terrible shame that a so-called civilized country like the United States has to be criticized in this Parliament . #% We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries . #% The Commission should ensure that the resources in future EU budgets are sufficient to provide for a continuation of existing EU programmes in an expanded Union of 25 . #% Indeed , we are working towards achieving a ban on it . #% There is quite considerable concern in the Member States that too often Christmas , which should be a time of joy , is a time of tragedy . #% All in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process . #% EU Member States need to consider ways in which we could harmonise our laws to exchange or compile registers of serious sex offenders . #% They have hijacked the EU institutions and this will mean that some states become second class members including the new applicant countries . #% The problem that I -- and I am sure many others like me -- now face is this : my registration is accepted here in Ireland , but once I cross the border to the north , to the UK , different criteria are needed to be registered as blind , and I am led to believe that this is the case in every other European state . #% It is necessary therefore to get the balance right . #% This is one of those rare occasions when cynical politicians get outraged . #% This is a very welcome report for those of us who have worked in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media on this issue . #% I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China . #% It will be above the threshold and that would leave our current strategy in tatters . #% For me , however , this motion has one main focus : to ask again what happened in Andijan last May and to make a further call for an open and independent inquiry . #% Mr President , I should also like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on the tremendous proposal she has put before us . #% I wish to thank Mrs de Palacio for studying the situation and for saying that she was keeping a watching brief . #% Will Turkey be a participant in the process ? #% I doubt whether any Member State constitution has ever been prepared in such an open and democratic way . #% But incineration has to be considered as a last resort and - as has been said already - waste reduction , re-use and recycling are the main things we should be striving for . #% Firstly , with regard to the Euratom framework programme , the promotion of nuclear energy has always characterized this programme and we are long overdue a change of vision , especially with regard to fusion . #% Both the geographical and the thematic content are close to the heart of the European Parliament and require a thorough debate . #% The Member States who are doing this have to acknowledge that they are not meeting their obligations . #% We should not use spurious environmental arguments to condemn a practice that we know and is scientifically shown to have no implications other than the catching of tuna fish . #% The new plan is likely to allow more industrial companies to shop around freely for competing sources of gas . #% We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it . #% We will , of course , monitor the Commission 's progress to deliver on these provisions . #% A single European market should be seen as an opportunity rather than a threat . #% There have been noticeable losses to countries like Mauritius , which now run the risk of being relegated to the category of poorest countries . #% Mr President , I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on her work on this report and in endorsing the majority of the proposals within it . #% I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , which was assured by the Commission that early warning systems had been put in place by the European Union to deal with humanitarian aid missions of this sort . #% You will not do that , Commissioner , by creating a situation in which it can continue . #% Mr President , the gentleman , his colleagues and his staff should be cleaning up the ` No to Europe ' literature and mess that is strewn around the grounds of this Parliament . #% This shows arrogance , even when they are called to account . #% There is no point in lamenting over the basic economic principle ; there is no point in arguing that we do not have a means of competing with the global economy . #% There is an imperative to continue to invest . #% On behalf of my Group , which also welcomes this renewed request for accession , I wish to say that we also welcome the Maltese Government 's decision and indeed the opinion , shared by the opposition , that there will be a referendum held on the conclusion of the negotiations . #% It is also fair to say that levels of preferential treatment , either in the form of tax concessions or grant aid , that are not acceptable within a Member State are also unacceptable within the European Union , whether these are in the form of benefits that come from the EU or from national governments . #% That is a scandal . #% Depression and anxiety disorders , including stress and eating disorders , are the most common mental health problems experienced . #% Mr President , like you I welcome the final referendum which took place in Latvia this weekend and resulted in a strong ` yes ' vote for joining the European Union . #% Just as in Ireland , market capitalism and financial speculation have devastated the economies of the Baltic States , including Lithuania , where unemployment has rocketed to 18 % and youth unemployment to a staggering 35 % . #% Article 1.4 in annex 3 regulates which persons or bodies within this House may request of the Commission access to confidential documents . #% The Lloyd 's petitioners are not only from the UK : they come from my country , Ireland , as well , and indeed also from Denmark and Germany , not to mention the investors who brought cases before the courts in the United States . #% I know it will also increase the size of the European Union as a trading block which in time will ensure that the Union as an economic entity becomes more competitive . #% It considers itself the moral police force of the world and yet it carries out the most appalling crime , basically a crime against humanity , in imposing the death sentence . #% I also welcome the fact that the European Commission recognises that the best approach to take to ensure the successful implementation of these action goals is best agreed under the framework of the United Nations . #% The process of enlarging the Union will be difficult both for the applicant countries and for the existing Member States . #% British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up . #% I would also have serious concern about the long-term desirability of becoming dependent on outside sources for our feedstuffs . #% 
Jim Grant led and largely created UNICEF , the UN response to children , until he died in 1995 . #% The Finnish Government has certainly started this process . #% The issue of agriculture : The United States and other countries refused to understand , even though it is a very simple notion , the multifunctional reasons for our common agricultural policy . #% However , it also contains comments with which I profoundly disagree . #% It is important that the European institutions that are directly accountable to the electorate - in other words , Parliament and the Council of Ministers - should continue to have - and be seen to have - the final decision-making authority on issues of importance to our citizens . #% Has the Commission no shame in trying to ride to success in the referendum campaign on the back of emotion and sentiment , such as the Commissioner deployed in her speech at the commemoration ceremony for the liberation of the concentration camp of Terezin at the weekend ? #% Under this directive there is a requirement to put in place trend reversal measures once pollution levels reach 75 per cent of the decreed quality standard . #% We import 70 % of our organic needs and again I have to refer to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland , because there are over 70 countries listed . #% Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist . #% I thank the rapporteur for all his cooperation and this balanced report , which I commend to the House . #% Contrary to the hysteria and misrepresentation spread by certain sections of the EU press , there is no question of dawn raids on teenagers in their homes . #% We are not proposing the patenting of software as in the US . #% The UN believes that last year USD 2.3 billion were generated by the drug trade in the major opium-growing areas in Afghanistan . #% On the 60 % of farms classified as part-time , the income was only EUR 6 590 . #% Therefore it is always difficult to interpret any differences . #% It is true that down the centuries many Member States have colonised other countries and unjustly exploited the weaker and poorer countries of the world , but in the 21st century we should realise that the imperialist approach is wrong . #% As the Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom has shelved legislation on transparency introduced by the previous Labour Government , I welcome the inclusion of my proposal to introduce such a requirement at the EU level . #% I welcome Parliament 's decision not to consider the Commission 's proposal to cut aid to cereal farmers . #% It is very alarming that this Parliament , and indeed the EU institutions as a whole , have very little concern about the use of depleted uranium . #% Here we are trying to protect the individuality of products and the uniqueness of local ingredients . #% It would be very useful to have this information on the breakdown as regards fish . #% At the same time as declaring he was in favour of transparency and openness in relation to this issue , he admitted that he only began to take action on it when it became a public issue about a week ago , despite his role as Secretary-General of NATO during the Balkans War . #% There is a clear need for the Commission to step up efforts to compile comparable data on critical indicators for the follow-up to the Platform for Action , and to translate it into regular reviews of gender mainstreaming initiatives across a range of policy fields . #% This is not the only brutal murder that has , unfortunately , taken place on our island in the last 30 years ; but this one has caused many across the world to sit up and recognise the activity that is continuing in Ireland seven years after the historic Good Friday Agreement . #% However , I would now like to ask the Commission again whether it will undertake to bring in measures complementary to this agreement in the first three months of next year . #% The current CAP , which has been reformed on many different occasions down the years , has become top-heavy with red tape and bureaucracy , and I rather feel that what we are proposing is to heap more misery on top of what already exists . #% However , the important decision is for Parliament to establish its position and thus let the agriculture Council bring in urgently needed changes . #% Fish farming offers prospects for the disadvantaged regions . #% It is not that the Parliament should be first among equals , but from now on it must be an equal among equals . #% This requires an assessment of the impact of ACTA on data protection and fundamental rights . #% However , as Chairman of the European Parliament Delegation to Canada , I fully recognise the importance that the Canadian Government attaches to its relationship with the 25 Member States of the European Union . #% I believe that there is no legal basis for this office and due to the different legal systems in the Member States there is no guarantee of the presumption of innocence and also that the probable success of prosecutions would be no quicker or more successful than the present system . #% The 10-month and 22-month premium for steers and the deseasonalisation premium must be kept in place . #% Europe should be sending a message beyond its borders that inhuman or degrading treatment of people with disabilities is utterly unacceptable . #% Equally , however , allowing for different threshold values in Member States to take account of these local natural conditions must not lead to unacceptable differences in the protection level or distortions in competition and trade . #% Could you do what you can to ensure those amendments are made available in the different languages this afternoon . #% We have to take that into account . #% Stereotyping of women is much more dangerous than stereotyping of men . #% The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the IPCC , an international panel of experts which assesses the scientific , technical , social , and economic aspects of climate change estimates that we need to decrease our emissions of greenhouse gas by 60-80 % on 1990 levels in order for our efforts to make an appreciable difference to rising global temperatures . #% Parliament has closely followed the functioning and impact of the instrument to ensure that the money is spent in accordance with these objectives . #% This regulation will allow consumers to avoid buying products containing non-textile parts of animal origin , whether for health , ethical or other considerations . #% That is why I am particularly satisfied that in the context of broader EU budgetary policies , the EU leaders are making provision to safeguard the viability of the common agricultural policy now and into the future . #% Mary Robinson , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against the sanctions imposed in violation of international law , which prohibits the starving of civilians as a method of warfare . #% However , one of my key areas of concern with regard to the e-commerce and e-Europe revolution is equality of access for consumers . #% Mr President , these dreadful weapons of destruction have hung over all our heads for a very long time now this century . #% Furthermore , where a small country is involved , we have been quick to criticise , but when the offender is a large country , such as China , our response has been much more muted and I very much welcome Commissioner Patten 's recent remarks in this regard . #% Ireland should take the lead within the EU Council in demanding a more acceptable Agreement . #% In relation to agricultural expenditure , I fully agree that more emphasis must be placed on the environment , food safety , traceability , animal welfare and consumer information . #% The European Union , the United States and other world powers , however , in their criticism of human rights violations in China , are very soft . #% Under Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure , there has to be an exchange of letters between the European Parliament and the Italian Government so that we can actually confirm his entitlement to vote and if that is the case , of course , it is a valid vote . #% These are essential , and it is appropriate that they be treated as damages to be covered by the compulsory civil liability . #% I know that these sorts of acts do not only happen on one side of the community , unfortunately . #% The risk of a further ` Credit Crunch ' is not over . #% Agriculture is a vitally important sector of the Irish economy and the protection of income levels of Ireland 's family farmers is central to our rural development aspirations . #% Could the EU not use its influence to encourage Equatorial Guinea to cease allowing vessels to use its flag to fish illegally . #% We want a consolidated European space policy . #% That can help to eliminate or to reduce our dependence on oil , it can also contribute towards a cleaner environment and , most importantly of all , it can offer many farmers around the European Union a valuable crop to grow , which would guarantee them economic security for the future . #% I am pleased to say that 22 of Parliament 's amendments were accepted in the common position and others have been accepted in subsequent negotiations . #% In Ireland successive governments have expressed their concern to UK governments concerning the accident rate at the BNFL institutions , particularly the accident rate at Sellafield on the UK 's least-populated west coast , only a few miles across from our most populated east coast . #% That is not unrelated to the issue that we are currently discussing in connection with the World Social Forum . #% But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland . #% Mr President , as we debate the revision of targets set in the 1994 packaging directive , in an effort to reduce the EU 's growing mountain of packaging waste , I would like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Corbey and the shadow rapporteur Mrs Ayuso González , for their hard work in this very important area . #% It is not a question of interfering with the Commission 's right of initiative in relation to the treaties , but a question of quality control . #% Let us make it known that the Community 's cooperation and assistance policies and programmes already extensively incorporate the fight against crime . #% Madam President , firstly , on Northern Ireland , it is clear that force and the threat of force have overcome the rule of law in Northern Ireland . #% To move away from that argument back to today : when we think of the lessons of 20 years , in Ukraine and Belarus and in other parts of Europe there are still children being born with birth defects . #% 
What is most in evidence is that it has brought voluntary organizations together and these organizations in turn have brought their public representatives into closer contact and greater cooperation with each other . #% We know that concentration is the name of the game now in both the Community competition policy and indeed in structural fund assistance . #% I also feel that inorganic substances must be handled differently to organic chemicals . #% This is the primary aim of this resolution . #% Mr President , as I listened to Mrs Green 's speech I felt the need to apply a brief reality check to it and to the procedures of this House . #% You have to take more into account the whole question of , not just giving aid , but fair trade . #% May I remind colleagues who support the zero quota -- and I know many do -- that withdrawal of this section of paragraph 5 today , that is , all the words after ` Appendix II ' , would not preclude another party to the conference re-tabling the zero quota request , if they wished to do so . #% Mr President , I want to add my voice to those Members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through Parliament . #% We want one inspection of every farm ; that should be enough anywhere to inspect . #% Even if there is very low probability of risk , we damage both consumer confidence and producer confidence . #% I want to compliment Commissioner Verheugen for what he said in relation to Turkey . #% On the question of aid funding , I believe that the budget support must be approved by the Court of Auditors and the parliament of the partner country . #% We have heard them here tonight about the car industry . #% rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development . - Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Szájer , for his efforts and for his report . #% The fact that we export over 90 % of our production makes the Irish sector relevant to other Member States and , indeed , it is often said that Ireland 's beef production is Europe 's surplus . #% It has a huge diplomatic corps which reflects its colonial past . #% Mr President , the Nitrates Directive deals expressly with nitrates in groundwater . #% Moreover , it is right that this Parliament should be consulted in advance concerning the principles and conditions for the partnerships which are to be established by the Union with each applicant . #% It is vitally important that we support Mr De Rossa 's opinion with regard to greater employee participation and consultation in the areas of mergers and developments . #% Too often public participation is filed away in some deep , dark drawer and very conveniently ignored . #% While it is important to put things right and to give people confidence , nevertheless it does not help their confidence if we exaggerate the extent to which abuses occur and money is lost . #% Could I ask you to include Frankfurt ? #% They too must be condemned . #% Large-scale commercial enterprises should not be allowed to usurp funding which should go , in my view , go to family farming . #% Mr President , currently there is a very expensive advertising campaign on US television in which people like the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation tell lies . #% As Mr Prodi said here this morning , our European Union must be able to take decisions . #% Their ability to survive is constantly undermined . #% The publication of the Green Paper on sustainable energy in Ireland should be viewed as a positive contribution to the debate on how we deal with the climate change threat within the energy sector . #% The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , therefore , takes note of the Commission 's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement , adopted on 7 December 2006 . #% We are dealing with taxpayers ' money ; they have entrusted their money to us and they rightly expect to see positive results within the context of overall value for money . #% We talk about democracy and transparency . #% On the key question of market access , we must move towards improved access to EU markets for exports from developing countries , so as to ensure that negotiating proposals take account of the economic interests of all parties . #% We need to respect this diversity and we need to find a balance between diversity and achieving coherence . ' #% My report proposes radical surgery to remove the glut of exemptions but still proposes the retention of green exceptions . #% Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme . #% Out of the 4500 people I met last week in Ireland , 3000 of them brought up issues of European concern that they wanted to see solved . #% For example , the Commission study indicates a 3 % fall in EU beef production , but a 12 % fall in Irish beef production . #% I would draw your attention in particular to recitals D and F of the resolution - which time does not allow me to read out - and I would ask you to read them carefully . #% Parliament has a right to know . #% Despite this , would you , Commissioner , accept the need for the European Parliament to give an opinion on the two directives and communication which you are presenting to us , particularly on whether or not the case for deep-level storage of highly radioactive waste has been proved ? #% I have just been informed that in the original text Mr Gallagher 's name was mentioned . #% There are two parts to my supplementary question . #% We have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link . #% They have a social conscience and favour enlargement . #% Thus I would have to part company from those who support a single Community scheme with what is termed ` ambitious criteria ' , but which to the industry might seem more like excessive regulation . #% Giscard d'Estaing said the same thing and that if the Irish people vote ` no ' other solutions will be found . #% Some people will be justified in opposing this Treaty because of their political beliefs , ideologies or their genuine concerns about what it means for those Member States . #% As far as ethical principles are concerned , I welcome the more specific language to reinforce the principle of voluntary unpaid donations of cells and tissues . #% And we also need a very serious information campaign sponsored by the European Union . #% I strongly support the suggestion that the EU should step up its efforts to meet the target of 3 % of GDP investment in research and development . #% in writing . - Deputy Locatelli 's report is part of the review of the Lisbon Strategy to make Europe 's economy the most competitive in the world by 2010 , and central to this is the position of researchers in Europe . #% Bend that rule and we and democracy will be the losers . #% The Constitution is a dream that we need to have put into practice . #% My last point is that this House must be seen around Europe as a House to be treated with respect and honour , because we have a mandate and we bring the voice of the people as close as possible to the heart of what the European Union is . #% I would also encourage Member States to develop this system as quickly as possible , because it will be part of the short-term resolution of the crisis , and I use that word advisedly , that exists at the moment with the availability of veterinary medicines on the ground . #% They used to be one of the world 's greatest fishing grounds , which is probably why fishermen went so far under difficult conditions to fish there . #% They had tried to negotiate one of those dreadful Irish country roads in the dark and they were not used to the different driving conditions of Ireland . #% The Member has quite rightly taken the empathy which we have , as presidency , with the situation she outlines . #% In short , we know that companies that do not get paid are at risk of collapsing , with knock-on effects for staff and suppliers . #% Madam President , I welcome this debate . #% Madam President , we support the report of Mr Teverson and the conclusions he comes to . #% Will the Commissioner investigate the case thoroughly with a view to instigating Court of Justice proceedings against the UK in this case ? #% What has happened here today has played right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry , which will now have more customers because more people are going to fall ill . #% This report is extremely important for a number of reasons , because it seeks to demonstrate to the citizens of Valencia that this European Parliament is not only a law-making body -- which of course it is -- but also a voice of the people of Europe when their rights are threatened . #% To many observers it appears to have been in the end about egos and macho behaviour all round - all in the context of an economic turnaround in Ireland in the last six to seven years that is the envy of many . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to say that I welcome the Commission 's publication of the new telecom directives and regulations on 12 July . #% 
Regarding SMEs , I hope that the Commission 's aim of funding large projects , while understandable , does not mean the exclusion of smaller projects which are more likely to be placed in smaller , peripheral Member States which are nonetheless in great need of help and support in this area . #% If that is your way , it is a political mistake for the Council and for Europe . #% Finally , the report lets the UK off the hook . #% I would like to ask the Minister to clarify , in the light of recent decisions , the position with regard to decoupling and compulsory modulation . #% We probably have it right on paper , but it is in terms of implementation where this may fall down . #% Uncertain law is bad law . #% It seems to me that a number of the forestry schemes that operate in Ireland most of the benefits go to speculators , particularly from outside the country . #% Parliament must take notice of this , because if we allow Member States to contravene the law in this way it has serious implications for the European Union as a whole . #% Mr President , like everyone else I am very concerned about the media reports today in particular that General Mladic and various other people have now been given free rein to impose further terror on Kosovo . #% The legitimate request of the people in Monasterevin , for example , for the re-opening of their train station and the people of Portlaoise for the upgrading of the service is fully justified . #% I commend the rapporteur , Mr Whitehead , and the shadow rapporteur , Mr Bowis , for a job well done throughout the discussion in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% Where everyone is responsible it can result in a system where no one is responsible . #% It is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the European Union . #% The policy was given a bad name in the past when most of the funds were channelled to the agricultural industry through the processors and exporters . #% Parliament has already addressed this equitable right to participate with its reference to the position of countries with small audiovisual capacity . #% As our beef industry is worth over # 50 million per year , agriculture is our biggest industry . #% I have no doubt that the Commissioner will assist in reaching a satisfactory resolution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in relation to this very important and very crucial area . #% On your behalf I extend my best wishes to her . #% That is why I welcome that fact that most of it will be spent at the rate of 50 % rather than 75 % . #% As regards additives in general , there is very little advantage to the consumer in the vast majority of them . #% However , as I pointed out , it is hoped that the Council will soon be in a position to reach such a common position . #% There are a number of models of worker participation . #% We need to end the ludicrous discriminatory practices that are stopping our businesses from getting a foothold in the European market . #% How can we ensure that we get a consensus that it is a fair and equitable distribution ? #% There is a huge unemployment crisis in Europe today , but we should not kid ourselves about how to respond to it . #% On a broader level , I support the debate taking place today on the need to promote equality in our society . #% I am tired of people saying that when you question America , somehow you are not one of its friends . #% That is unfortunately what is happening in Ireland at the moment , as a result of the failure of the Irish Government to properly implement this posting of workers directive . #% On the legislative programme : as regards its form I am glad it is going to the committees within the House . #% The scenes in Dublin were more reminiscent of other countries , where there are greater extremes of climate . #% My group subscribes to the broad detail of the resolution , so I will not rehearse the issues . #% Can he not answer the question of the honourable Member and state that the Council does abhor violence under all circumstances , that the Council does want to see the IRA cease-fire restored , can encourage the IRA cease-fire to be restored and indeed congratulate the Loyalist cease-fire for holding in these very trying circumstances ? #% I welcome the reduced rate of modulation agreed by the Council . #% Harbouring terrorists is a crime in itself . #% Concerning diversification , not all those leaving farming and/or rural dwellers are entrepreneurs , or interested in being so . #% I will not bore you with the details , but we finally arrived here . #% If we allow patents , how much of the creativity and freedom to think will be stifled by the fear of infringement of one of the hundreds of thousands of patents that will exist ? #% Mr President , one of the saddest things I have seen in recent times was Rosemary Nelson 's children following the hearse to the graveyard last month after this human-rights lawyer was brutally murdered in Northern Ireland . #% However , being familiar with parliamentary democracy yourself , you know that eaten bread is soon forgotten and it is good to hold back some of the spicy and sugary stuff until the very end of the Presidency ! #% This proposal replaces the mechanism in operation since 1993 for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating progress towards meeting commitments in respect of these emissions . #% What we are calling for is the suspension of that agreement , not a suspension of all contact with Israel , but a suspension of the preferential arrangements that Europe has with Israel so that at least it will begin to recognise that we are prepared to take action . #% This is actually about protecting jobs that already exist and about protecting our environment and indeed our fishing industry . #% The figures agreed will permit Ireland to increase emissions only by 13 per cent relative to 1990 figures . #% If it is accurately reported then you must make it clear that it is your personal view and not the view of the Commission . #% Many colleagues come from Member States which were this summer struck by floods and landslides . #% Stability is needed , and suggestions that a new reform is necessary will only bring about more uncertainty . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group and all the political groups for a wide-ranging discussion and debates . #% Mr Gahrton said that his government stated that it is only after a UN Security Council resolution has been adopted . #% At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution . #% Everything else can be sorted out by simple legislation . #% GNP would be a much fairer criterion . #% I was terribly shocked in my own country when I began to read in a serious Sunday newspaper recently an alleged transcript of a criminal and pornographic nature . #% The distinction is there for one simple reason and it has served its purpose well down the years . #% One simply can not adopt an à la carte approach . #% There will be peace on the island of Ireland if peace can be established between those two communities . #% We need to get the balance right with access to generic medicines and innovation and research and the needs of the pharmaceutical companies . #% Mr Titley is out of step with his own Foreign Minister who said that he wanted to clean up the UK 's international arms export reputation . #% However , we must pay due regard to long-established practices in an industry that has been largely self-regulating in many countries . #% On the Irish interest rate , those of us who have lent another country money deserve an interest rate which reflects the risk , but we also want our money back . #% All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected . #% This is not a residents ' association , this is Parliament ! #% This matter should be left to the Member States because otherwise , as has already been seen , there would be differences in implementation of the penalties . #% I take particular exception to his comment that people who backed Turkey 's accession are ` the adversaries of the European Union ' . #% It was met , of course , with a predictable grovelling response by the majority in this House . #% We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos , a real public space for the citizens of Europe . #% The examples are there for all to see . #% 
My group is strongly opposed to the actions taken by the Council with a view to bringing telecommunications interception capabilities into line with the new technologies . #% Agricultural statistics for the period 1993-2003 #% The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area . #% They have links to that organisation . #% As part of our oversight role , we must insist that policy continuously focus on the achievement of the MDGs , which aim to alleviate some of the worst forms of poverty in the world . #% I support the proposal that set-aside be fixed at 5 % for the 1998 harvest but without reducing payments for land taken out of production . #% Mr President , I wish to speak on the Poignant report . #% In Ireland , spouses of self-employed people or farmers are often not covered by social insurance in their own right , even though they work on the farm or in the business . #% Europe needs this constitution , which would make the Union more democratic , more socially engaged and more comprehensible to its citizens and would enable us to play a more positive role on the world stage . #% Not only did you do this on time , as promised , but you also came forward with a 140-page document which , unlike the present Treaty , can be easily read by ordinary citizens and , most importantly , they can make sense of it on that first reading . #% While we should never risk rare blood groups or rare blood products being unavailable to patients through our unwillingness to pay , that must be the exception . #% It is appropriate that provisions be made to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the pilot period of 2005 to 2007 . #% The integrity of this House demands detailed answers to questions which raise major doubts about aspects of a regulation upon which the motion before us is based and on which we will be asked to vote tomorrow . #% Can he assure the House that whatever is agreed in relation to the reform of Europe 's common agricultural policy will be fully protected in those negotiations , because otherwise the entire negotiating process would be meaningless ? #% We are facing a situation whereby , on one hand , the world 's population is growing , while , on the other , food production is proving to be an ever more challenging endeavour owing to the negative effects of climate change and rising costs associated with food production . #% Mr President , firstly let me say to my colleague and friend , Ms McKenna , that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with . #% The gender pay gap remains unacceptably high across Europe at 16 % . #% Following the Dublin Summit there seems to be a consensus in favour of agreeing on a revised Treaty at the Amsterdam meeting of June next year . #% I welcome the emphasis on an integrated policy approach and on the external impact of EU policy on sustainable resources . #% The Council of Europe is putting the finishing touches to the world 's first international convention on cyber-crime . #% A prime example of this , in the Irish context , is environmental legislation . #% I have spoken before of the need for imaginative gestures from both sides in this conflict . #% As a result of these momentous decisions , our new neighbours will be Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova . #% Regions that have just emerged from a state of low economic development usually suffer from serious deficiencies in their infrastructure . #% Many of my colleagues are upset that no explicit reference is made to the rights of rapporteurs . #% There is no point in people coming into this House and talking about liberal proposals when you look around and see young people dying from drug abuse , while the people who import and sell these drugs are getting away scot-free . #% Appointments of key new personnel in Europe to tackle international terrorism in Europe are to be welcomed , but we must remember that democracy is fragile and we must be strong in our efforts to promote the rule of law and protect democratic institutions . #% I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection , David Byrne , in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet . #% We should not automatically presume . #% When I started my insurance career a long time ago - practically 30 years ago - I remember the first week I was in the company , and the boss told me : ` The big challenge facing us is that we are going to have to deal with competition from Europe ! ' #% Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report . #% That will spell a very serious failure of the institutions to find common ground and agreement on what is a very important area for the European economy generally . #% Irish Rail needs major investment and modernization . #% By this I do not mean merely paying lip-service to the combat against child labour , or putting in place cursory or superficial monitoring systems . #% We all agree that the EU budget must be framed in such a way as to meet its objectives . #% I congratulate Mr Nisticò on his excellent work and I commend Amendment No 75 which gets the balance right . #% Delays in this area are leading to confusion on the part of consumers and may well be depriving European agriculture of the tools necessary for sustainability , quality and competitiveness . #% Another problem is clearly the fact that much of the scientific evidence on these matters is conflicting . #% Secondly , the election procedure whereby members are elected by an absolute majority is not ideal . #% As has been said repeatedly , they are not the cause of the problems of Europe . #% In this growing atmosphere of international terrorism , surely it is grossly irresponsible to continue this transportation . #% In the context of south-east Europe , the definition of synergy is one where it represents the ability of a group to outperform even its best individual member . #% In answer to Mr Giansily , the Commissioner clearly remarked that at this point he was not willing to decide the actual passage to the single currency because that is for next year . #% If these councils are to play a meaningful role in the future , fishermen must be involved in all phases of the management process . #% It makes sense to accept a scheme that is mandatory at the level of Member States as all states must participate in the effort to reduce emissions . #% We talk a lot about the sustainability of European agriculture . #% I am saying no to unilateral war . #% Each group has its own particular concerns , but one common theme emerges : the proposed legislation does not take sufficient account of the different situations in the Member States . #% Member States must take their own commitments in these areas seriously . #% The citizens of the European Union demand and deserve institutions that deal with their concerns and complaints in a professional and open manner , and which are prepared to admit their failures and bring about adequate redress . #% The people appear in certain areas to have resolved to take the law into their own hands in an effort to protect their own children and go beyond the law in some cases . #% Equally , promoting market economies in Eastern and Central Europe is good news for businesses within the Union , which can also expand their goods and services into new markets . #% There is a necessity and an urgency with regard to ensuring that those people who make investments in the tourism product and the tourism area are given the necessary back-up marketing and structural supports from the European Union programmes , which are sometimes denied them because they have already made capital investments themselves . #% It is clearly necessary that the use of mercury is properly controlled and we have made substantial progress in recent years on related matters such as storage and export . #% The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled , the British , Irish and the Nordic countries another view . #% A self-employed driver has many more tasks to carry out and is more likely to be fatigued when first taking the wheel , never mind having worked 10 or 12 hours in the day , so I would strongly support this report and welcome the compromises that Stephen Hughes has reached . #% This is an issue where , in the WTO , China uses trade as a tool of political blackmail , and we should have used the EU/China WTO negotiations for leverage in the same way . #% They have been forced off their islands to live in exile in other places . #% This is causing serious problems because at the heart of that legislation is the recognition of the right of every child to know and have access to both its parents . #% As I said , in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations . #% In my own country , the Bantry Bay coastal zone chart is the only agreed integrated coastal zone management plan in the whole of the country at the present time . #% Above all , the EU needs to retain the trust of European farmers . #% Most of all , we need to have a pensions reserve fund , so that there can be inter-generational solidarity between this generation and not just the next generation but also the generation after that . #% The first relates to institutional reform and the second to policy matters . #% There are now European-wide programmes operating in all elements of our education system . #% I do not share these concerns , but Irish citizens need assurance in these points , not only in the context of this debate , but also with regard to long-term Irish interests within the EU . #% 
There is a great danger that President Uribe will use this as a propaganda stunt to give the impression at international level that everything is fine . #% Finally , I have one minor quibble with the rapporteur when she says that agriculture must remain central to the economies of rural areas . #% The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003 . #% It would have been useful if we had known the outcome of the final meeting before this debate , but unfortunately I do not have any information from it and it is probably not possible to obtain it . #% The necessity to follow up the catch into the marketplace to make sure that we know exactly where the fish that are marketed in a given market are coming from is extremely important . #% in writing . - Mr Leichtfried should be commended for a thorough and conclusive report , which had dealt effectively with many of the issues left open by the Commission paper . #% May your future go well . #% It is clear that , in many Member States , homosexual couples do not have any rights and there are grave injustices within Member States . #% It is clear that natural hazards pose a global threat and warrant global responses . #% There is no sound reason why the shallow sand quarry should be subjected to the same legislative demands as the large , deep mine producing hazardous waste . #% We want to ensure that this is done . #% There is a great threat to their fundamental rights . #% We must give hope to young farmers and encourage young people to make farming their future . #% Could we have a guarantee from the President-in-Office that , whilst they may not agree with the ringfencing of 1 % , they will give a definite commitment that there will be a percentage available when the new ESF operation comes into being ? #% Madam President , very soon the European Parliament will vote on public access to documents . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr Macartney for his report which is well done and represents the views and concerns of the Committee on Fisheries . #% The journalist 's murder was followed yesterday by the intimidation of a Dublin Member of Parliament who had also condemned the drug barons . #% One of the most interesting is the simple idea of a national holiday on Europe Day . #% Smaller Member States must be strongly represented within the overall EU institutional structure . #% The negotiations which have begun on Agenda 2000 are among the most important ever to be undertaken by the Union . #% While the European food chain remains one of the safest in the world , recent scandals have damaged our consumers ' confidence in the food we eat and the methods we use to produce it . #% The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expeditious solution to this problem . #% Throughout this decade we have never had unemployment less than 10 % of the labour force . #% Therefore I will be supporting Amendment No 15 as well as Amendment No 9 . #% So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully . #% Cartloads of nuclear waste are regularly stored at marshalling yards in Willesden . #% However , turning to his reply , one of the biggest hindrances to cross-border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one-stop shop for registration of a company , that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State , it should be reciprocal in all other Member States , because the same basis for decision-making under the internal market rules should apply . #% I am calling on the European Commission to carry out this independent research in consultation with EU airline companies and EU consumer groups . #% We need a clear strategy for the 21st century aimed at significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources in our overall energy policy . #% One vote at a time . #% A world-class Titanic exhibition centre is planned for the very site where that famous ship was built . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner . #% One of the difficulties we face is that we have different legal systems within the EU Member States , which have built up bodies of law and precedent . #% Mrs Malone is quite correct when she says that our birth rate is rising but , unfortunately , it is rising in areas where the children do not have the best possible advantages for the future . #% It is an excellent report and I support the call on Commissioner Bonino to initiate an information campaign dealing specifically with the difficulties of the introduction of the euro into the consumer 's pocket in the year 2002 . #% I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63 . #% I am not satisfied that these loans are for safety as opposed to plant construction purposes . #% We have no idea of the extent to which we are responsible for the 500 000 deaths resulting from the use , and indeed misuse , of small arms exports . #% All the applicant countries are in need of substantial help to develop industry and infrastructure . #% If their function has become obsolete , they should have access to similar jobs with the same conditions . #% It must be painful for the Commissioner and Mr Jarzembowski to see such wide-ranging opposition to this proposal as there is here today . #% It is a sensible position in helping us to work with business and consumers that we can ensure that court action is only the last resort and we can find better ways to resolve disputes . #% I want to talk about some of the issues we dealt with , not in detail but just to give a flavour . #% I might say that if there is any question of any need for safety measures then I have no difficulty with supporting the proposal for an environmental audit which the honourable Member outlines . #% Attempts to compromise are always interpreted as weakness by bullies , and China is such a bully . #% So that is not a single market : no competition there , no help to the consumer . #% That system has decided in its wisdom that the public -- the ordinary citizens -- whose lives will be immediately and permanently affected by certain environmental decisions can not be trusted to participate in and influence such important decisions . #% I am glad to see that our fishing agreements with developing countries combine some financial aid with a commitment to improving structures and training facilities and providing better opportunities for local fishermen . #% That is an important message and the central message that has emerged from your successful presidency and on that you deserve rich and proper congratulation . #% As rapporteur on the REGI Committee , I strongly urge that the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget be restored and that cohesion be considered one of the policy priorities of the EU . #% With the reform , under the Agenda 2000 proposals , of the structural and cohesion funds , perhaps an opportunity could be found to make new funding available , not only for research and development as regards how the new technologies may be best adapted but also for cooperative programmes between the local authorities and the Member States at a local , as well as a European Union , level to try and resolve some of these difficulties and problems . #% That violence includes a Palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in Jerusalem and a number of Israeli attacks on members of Hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas . #% The outlook for the future in terms of securing a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East is , I believe , now more promising than ever . #% Criminals often profit from illegal shipments , as traffickers involved in the scam often trick authorities by not labelling goods as electronics , by pretending they are for re-use , or by hiding them in the middle of a container for shipment . #% This must all be put on a database , so that information can be shared by all enforcement officers throughout the EU . #% Surely now is the time , under this presidency , to reverse the decision . #% Mr President , I really am very upset that in the Intergovernmental Conference , we have what I would regard as a lamentable failure of political leadership - a retreat into national chauvinism - at a time when we need a democratic , effective , power-sharing Europe . #% It is wise for the Commission to have chosen the route of allowing some margin of manoeuvre and thereby trying to encourage Member States in their efforts to make these maps more consistent . #% How can we then claim that our products are unique , that they are our rich regional flavour , or that they are from our region at all ? #% We understand that it was not formally transmitted to the Member States in the Council . #% in writing . - Poor corporate governance in financial institutions - and particularly banks ' murky pay culture - was a key factor in creating the conditions for the financial crisis . #% In so doing , we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013 . #% When the Commission 's proposals first appeared , we , in the Green Party , welcomed them . #% The recent unrest in eastern Chad , including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army , underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) from getting caught in the crossfire . #% Under my reading of the rules , which were adopted by the Bureau without consultation with Parliament , I am entitled , as a Member , to stand up at every roll-call vote and state that I am present but I am not participating in the vote . #% However , looking at the current packaging directive and at compliance with it , and just looking at my own country Ireland and a number of others , for example Portugal and Greece - they are all now looking for derogations for extra time . #% 
I welcome Mrs d'Ancona 's proposed visit to Holloway Prison . #% For this reason , the creation of a uniform legal basis for controlling and preventing the spread of BSE and scrapie is paramount and there is still , as other speakers have suggested , a lack of consistency in relation to the application of the regulations within individual Member States . #% The abolition of import quotas on 1 January 2005 has , in the UK and elsewhere , caused soaring imports , especially from China . #% Mr President , this area is extremely complex , but it is most important that we address it to ensure the continuing viability of our farms and rural areas . #% I believe there is still a lot of support for that idea and I hope that the Commission will consider this idea as part of a strategy to give greater control to the local communities . #% One final point I would like to make is that the value of an electoral observation exercise is seriously diminished if there is no follow-up . #% There must be no erosion of the workers ' rights that have been won over time . #% Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report . #% But it proposes very radical changes which can potentially pose problems for some of the Member States , particularly those in the front line of terrorism . #% Cigarette smuggling has almost replaced drug trafficking , due to the enormous profit margins that can be exploited without the same degree of risk in terms of penal sanctions . #% Finally , on the question of the Irish referendum , the message given both by the Council and the Commission today is an important one . #% I believe that technical advancement in other forms of energy , including perhaps nuclear fusion , make the future very unsure . #% From my experience , the main problems stem from a lack of uniformity of laws under the two existing international conventions in this area , together with a lack of cooperation at intergovernmental level . #% Mr President , this debate would be amusing if it were not so serious . #% The Commission indicated that it will be modifying its proposal on the performance reserve . #% And why are transport workers and childcare workers excluded ? #% I would like to concentrate on one point that concerns me greatly and that is the future availability of veterinary resources , particularly in remote regions of the European Union . #% These arguments and this debate are predicated not on real divergence of opinion with regard to a better form of social model , but merely on maintaining an archaic , protectionist system . #% Last June , Senegal suspended negotiations until October in order to gain time to analyse the fisheries issues and their effects . #% I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work , particularly in reaching a useful and speedy conclusion at second reading . #% I ask you , Mr President , to bring this matter to the attention of the President of Parliament , and to ask him to contact the Israeli authorities with a view to allowing this man his liberty . #% We should not allow a system to develop whereby the European Union is given a free hand to impose criminal sanctions in Europe . #% It has facilitated the laundering of up to EUR 30 million from a Turkish construction company located in the Republic of Ireland . #% They can see it coming in the future . #% There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States , following Ireland 's appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced . #% The protection of intellectual property should be one of your concerns . #% I support the proposal for a directive on the conditions required for the crews of vessels providing regular passenger and freight ferry services between Member States . #% It is important that scientific testing look at the dioxin/PCB level of compound feed as an end product , rather than the dioxin level of just one ingredient such as fish oil . #% Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive , a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the aegis of agencies . #% To conclude , consumer information must be complete and accurate . #% There are other aspects of the legislation which are also extremely disturbing . #% I welcome it and largely agree with the assessment and authorisation procedures it proposes . #% Mr President , may I take it from what the Commissioner said that he is undertaking to give Parliament an annual report and will take into account the other two points in my conclusions ? #% This point has been made and I want to endorse it . #% If we want to be passionate , then let our passion be based on facts . #% Instead she used the opportunity to expound a rather theoretical framework on trade which is her own rather than anyone else ' s . #% And thirdly , an orientation of technological innovation in the less-favoured regions towards the promotion of sustainable development , promoting local skills and using local natural and human resources . #% Finally , we must mount a serious campaign at the United Nations for sanctions against Burma . #% Finally , I would like to point out that , in spite of modern medicine and the abundance of food and water , the burden of disease in the EU is increasing . #% Signs of Malta 's close ties with the EU are clearly evident on the island . #% I believe that taxation issues are best controlled by national governments and local authorities as opposed to a centralised European Union . #% 380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission . #% It is frequently difficult for temporary residents to obtain local insurance cover at a reasonable price . #% I have no doubt that you will carry out your responsibilities with efficiency . #% As Mr Perry has rightly said , the people of Europe are effectively probing the laws of Europe , the directives of Europe and the issues that concern them most closely . #% In conclusion , the main obstacle at this point is diplomatic . #% Mr President , the Helsinki Summit of EU leaders has been quite accurately billed as the European Union 's enlargement Summit , and there can be no doubt that this European Council meeting has lived up to this particular expectation . #% Mr President , the key objectives which the Spanish Government set out for its presidency of the European Union have been achieved . #% This is something that the Green Group stated a long time ago in this Parliament and we have now been vindicated . #% He had chosen as the symbol of his party the donkey . #% I understand this need well . #% Mr President , there are two things that are giving rise to fear at the moment : the absence of a vaccine for the virus that has been found and a fear that the authorities , both national and European , are not properly geared for dealing with a virus which knows no boundaries . #% The definition of a food supplement in the directive should reflect all supplements . #% I am delighted to say that the industry concerned with renewable energy has this evening taken the very sensible step of setting up the European Renewable Energy Export Council . #% The bottom line is this : if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe , we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems . #% Priorities may change rapidly , according to our political agendas and those of our partners , but a procedural regulation will ensure that implementation can go on unhindered . #% The Commission is certainly aware of the speed and efficiency with which this proposal was dealt with in Parliament . #% deputising for the author . - President-in-Office , thank you for the response to the question . #% I think that should be referred to the Bureau . #% No Member State can actually pat itself on the back if we do not know exactly the end result of what they are doing . #% I will conclude by inviting the Commission to submit a proposal for the continuation of the EPRD to Parliament and the Council as quickly as possible for our consideration in good time before the end of the present programme . #% Does the Council not share the fear expressed recently by the Bank for International Settlements that there is a risk of deflation if we push the price stability objective beyond what is appropriate ? #% We can go back over previous resolutions and reports from this house concerning people with disabilities . #% In exposing and standing up to the thuggery of Sinn Féin / IRA , the McCartney sisters have shown remarkable bravery . #% It is essential that it is workable across 25 countries and it is essential that the subsidiarity principle is enshrined in our legislation so that we can achieve high standards that work at national level . #% We must not encourage people to infringe copyright . #% 
Mr President , in many ways we have become so desensitised to the violence that takes place around the world that what happened in Jenin , what has happened with the suicide bombers in Israel , has seemed to pass us by completely . #% I ask that the present derogation be maintained to allow time to implement these changes remembering that , should an EU-rail operator wish to enter the Irish rail market , the derogation would immediately cease . #% There must be no cover-up and the problem must be addressed directly by this Parliament and the European Union . #% Let us understand and fully bring into being the Europe of diversity in this reunited form . #% I think it should happen , it must happen , and the Commission has a role here as well in insisting that it does happen . #% I would ask you to write to the Angolan Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels for an explanation of why we were prevented from visiting Angola at the very last moment . #% Given the increased frequency of flights and the huge number of passengers flying nowadays , harmonisation of safety standards at the highest , scientifically supported safety level is imperative , in order to create a level playing field within the enlarged EU . #% Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the presidency and the European heads of State and government for their support and positive contribution to the process of revisiting the Treaty of Nice by Ireland . #% We can tap into the expertise of the various nations in the various regions of the world . #% Cooperation between police forces , where there is widespread information on prostitution amongst young girls in the Member States , has unfortunately to be an intrinsic part of our asylum policy . #% I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council about the presidency 's position on tackling the smuggling of Ecstasy , since it can be made in someone 's kitchen and does not need to be transported across borders ; whereas heroin , opium and cocaine involve importation . #% We need a broad perspective , not one which focuses only on accessibility in education . #% In fact , the price of bullocks and the number of new car sales , in no particular order , have long been yardsticks of economic performance in Ireland . #% Reducing fatalities and deaths on our roads must remain as the central political goal . #% Let us focus on education , let us work together for the common good . #% EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services . #% Part and parcel of such an approach will be the further development of sectoral policies including those for agriculture , the environment , health , family planning and education . #% It provides for the development of common actions in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters while preserving Member State responsibility for maintaining law and order and safeguarding internal securities . #% The overall objective of any development policy must be to strive to build and strengthen democracy and the rule of law , with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms . #% There are shared-city initiatives to promote community ; there is development and training for unemployed women - I am just singling out some of the very successful operations that are going on - the development of the food industry and , of course , the new housing development . #% If the Commission were allowed to go ahead - and I am quite sure it will not - it would do more damage to non-urban areas in the European Union than anybody here could imagine . #% Yes , it is about 40 % of the Community budget at the moment but that reflects more on the size of the Community budget than on spending on agriculture . #% Just as I would criticise the United States , I am not blind to the inconsistency of the EU on these issues - the Council in particular . #% I would appeal to the Commission to use some political sagacity in its approach to this situation . #% Quota hopping must be dealt with , and in the Irish Sea the Hague preference , which totally distorts fishing quotas , should be abolished . #% Having left my house at 7 a.m. this morning I expected to be in Strasbourg at 4 p.m. #% The legislators ' dilemma is to produce good effective law which protects the consumer , while allowing business to thrive in a dynamic and competitive environment . #% We can not bury our heads in the sand and deny the fact that this is already happening . #% Through my work in Parliament I too have experienced the fact that so many children are deprived of the company and love of both their parents , very often due to selfishness and lack of understanding about the particular needs of children . #% As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , it is good news because towns such as Naas , Newbridge , Kilcullen , Wicklow , Athy , Arklow , Kildare and Monasterevin must all in the near future secure the necessary finance for the upgrading of their respective railway operations . #% The Commission and the Council should also take this advice , that it is time we sought to ensure that fish stocks remain , and not just the industry , which will have nothing to fish for in the future if it does not realise that there is a problem . #% Included within this process must be the efficient working of the codecision procedure , which covers the enactment of EU legislation across 38 different economic and social sectors of our society . #% In an ideal world it would be achievable but the problem is that producers must give evidence of health claims made for their product . #% The leading candidates are provisionally closing chapters at an impressive rate and the leading candidate country , Cyprus , now has 23 chapters concluded . #% The House will be aware that banks availed themselves of the transition period to cream off excessive exchange charges and , to some extent , this is still happening . #% The Member States have placed the concerns of industry and their own cost concerns ahead of the interests of our citizens . #% It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well ! #% When people speak about ensuring that other people can use software patents , they seem to think that everybody can come up with these ideas themselves and do not need any protection or grounding in those ideas . #% However , I agree with her that some funding should come from the priority thematic areas for the science and society implications . #% Some colleagues may have confused harmonisation of the tax base with the harmonisation of company accounts and requirements for transparency between companies and their accounts . #% Human rights abuses have increased , not diminished . #% Successful ratification is possible , but only if a huge effort is put into the ` yes ' campaign . #% It is not a question of defending an , but of looking to see how high-quality services to our citizens can be guaranteed across the board in what are new circumstances . #% Until we deal with that and stop running away from the problem , we are never going to find a solution . #% I commend the establishment of the Pan-Irish Sea Alliance and wish them every success in delivering results to their vulnerable coastal communities . #% The consumer must still have the right to go to court as a last resort . #% One of the concerns for many Irish people was the issue of whether the Nice Treaty would jeopardise Ireland 's traditional neutrality . #% That is why we supported the Gallagher report . #% Jacques Delors was aware of this when he wrote in his White Paper that environmental technologies can create jobs and , in that way , bring about a much fairer society . #% It means that any new fishing gear or any significant modification of existing gear must be evaluated for its potential impact on the target stock as well as any species caught as by-catch or any impact on the marine habitat . #% When we demanded individual accountability , we were rebuffed by the shield of collegiality . #% We can not deny that the issue of developing deep-vein thrombosis is not a serious concern for air passengers . #% Is this not a matter best left to Member States ? #% This is something on which the EU Food and Veterinary Office must focus in the immediate future . #% Thirdly , a very solid and continuously evolving education and training system , because the real tools we should use to adapt our workforce to the present , as well as future , conditions are those of education and knowledge . #% We all agree with that . #% It is my sincere wish that his legacy will now be recognised as a man of peace who worked tirelessly for all those in need . #% It sets a very dangerous precedent . #% The alcohol industry portrays alcohol as something that is necessary to enjoy life . #% A very big multinational company - Fruit of the Loom - is pulling out of a labour-intensive industry with thousands of jobs because they want to get the product manufactured in Morocco . #% I believe that great credit is due to the Commission , in particular Commissioner Byrne , for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each of the issues that needed to be tackled to guarantee our consumers a safe and traceable product , from farm to fork . #% While safety is their primary responsibility , they are mainly engaged in other tasks . #% There can be no question of our going back , under pressure from the Americans , on any of the commitments we have entered into with our farmers . #% My approach is to try to find the appropriate solutions so that different economic interests are catered for in a mutually acceptable way . #% It is then incumbent on those of us who support this Treaty , which will streamline how the EU does its business , to get out and positively promote its provisions to the people of Europe . #% The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics has come to very useful conclusions here and its report should have been taken before this debate . #% 
However , the current cycle of violence is causing widespread suffering and this is taking the parties even further away from a negotiated settlement . #% Unless we create sustainable employment at regional level and , in the context of this report , employment suitable for women , then the economic and social viability of rural communities will be put at further risk . #% The United States clearly has double standards : they have allowed many others to enter , including Gerry Adams and Nelson Mandela , with various pasts . #% In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars , two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances . #% This is as true for Ireland as it is for every Member State . #% This makes it easy for the public to access and locate information and is very welcome . #% I congratulate all concerned for reaching that agreement so that the card can be in active use by 1 June 2004 . #% Mr President , for clarification , my group was also an author of this resolution but somehow we got dropped off the list . #% Those that think that the system is wrong should practise what they preach and should only present their tickets for reimbursement and should not avail themselves of the other expenses and continue with this sort of hypocrisy . #% As a general political philosophy I support the whole concept of enterprise and competitiveness and the need to reward effort and initiative and that has to be at the core of job creation . #% But once one of the free-wheeling states is asked to pedal , then there are cries for equity , for fairness and for a level playing field . #% I fully respect your personal choice . #% Under the various insurance directives , for instance , non-national insurance companies are required to have an agent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State . #% Northern Ireland which I represent is such a region . #% Also there is a suggestion that Continental AG is putting obstacles in the way of selling the plant to another company or to a management/workers buy-out . #% We can not continue to allow the situation where people are so desperate that they will do anything and even put themselves and their children at risk in order to find a new life . #% The proposal reaches its most ludicrous and unacceptable point when it embraces the progressive financing of the EU by direct taxation . #% It is all or nothing in terms of your new college . #% There is a link between that instability and our failure to take the necessary measures . #% Article 23 provides for an assessment of the impact of the directive and Parliament will take that seriously . #% If no measures are taken , the Commission estimates that emissions of fluorinated gases will be 50 % above the 1995 levels by 2010 . #% This was a major issue of sensitivity during the Irish referendum campaign on the Lisbon Treaty . #% This is of pressing concern considering the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico with the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill . #% Think again , Mr President , when these matters come up for debate and discussion . #% I also greet Mr Cox and extend to him as well . #% Giving the United Nations the lead role in post-war Iraq , as EU leaders have requested , would be the clearest demonstration on the part of the United States that it values the transatlantic relationship and it genuinely wants to rebuild it . #% The government is right to look boldly at new ways of disposing of residential , industrial , commercial and agricultural waste . #% In this Parliament we hear again and again about exchanging best practice between Member States . #% Personally , I had understood that was her position . #% Mr President , very hearty congratulations to Mrs Rothe for an excellent report . #% There has been no agreement to date on whether or not the European Union should appoint a special representative for Iraq . #% Therefore , I was somewhat heartened by the daring-to-risk-going-bust attitude of the conference because that would give us experience to know the main reasons why small and medium-size enterprises fail , whilst at the same time recognising that they are the biggest engine of growth within the overall European Union economy , creating something like 82 % of employment and representing 74 % of all manufacturing . #% Questions concerning collective bargaining or collective agreements are a matter for the Member States themselves and not for anyone else . #% I thank him for his efforts in this respect . #% The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers . #% Furthermore , this WHO body takes the added precaution of incorporating large safety factors into the limit values to public exposure . #% It was always going to take time to tease through what were very difficult , delicate and sensitive political matters . #% In my own country , Ireland , and in the neighbouring United Kingdom , the predominant language is an ever more global English . #% They might have been brought up in religious fundamentalism and other cultures , where there was serious oppression of women and physical and sexual violence against women . #% Mr President , I too would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on his speed and efficiency with regard to this programme and also to thank the Commissioner for her initiative in recognising the opportunities offered by information technology . #% Somebody made the comment that the Council pays . #% We were accompanied by many members of the media , who surely were not also being duped and manipulated . #% Nevertheless , production controls ensure that many farmers can not increase their income from farming and , therefore , alternative income-generating opportunities from off-farm activities are vital if rural populations are to benefit from economic growth . #% We must remember that we live in the European Union where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is in operation . #% Was this an indictment of the European project or a mid-term wake-up call to our political establishment ? #% I thank the Member for his comments and , just in case there is any mistake , I will also check the matter . #% Mr President , as we discuss the war in Iraq we should realise immediately that never in the history of the world has there been a war in which the vast majority of victims have not been innocent civilians . #% That is not acceptable . #% Mr Chichester may hold those views , but they were not for this report . #% Society , as this House knows , is a much wider concept than the economy , and that must be our starting-point . #% I am staggered at the absence of a single , solitary word of reference to the ECHO programme . #% the mixing of police , security and intelligence forces , which could lead to abuse of powers against the citizens , as has been seen recently in Ireland ; #% The Euratom Atomic Energy Community was founded in 1957 and is now well past its sell-by date . #% This new development must be stopped and the proceeds of their crimes tracked down and confiscated . #% The partnership approach involving all European governments and all EU institutions in the formulation of key European Union policies must always be preserved . #% We deal with many , many problems from across Member States but , as the statistics show , some countries use the services of the committee more widely than others , perhaps because there are members of the committee who are from those countries and therefore they attract problems from their constituents . #% I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer . #% It is a great shame that every time an issue like this is raised with Commissioner Nielson , or raised with the Commission , he passes it off as if it did not matter - as if he did not believe this was happening . #% There is absolutely no doubt in my view that that is the case and it has given rise to all kinds of concerns . #% I was quite surprised that I was going to be censored like this . #% Would renationalisation mean any more fish ? #% What needs to be done to enable us to respond as we should ? #% If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens . #% Mr President , I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level . #% To give you one example , the polio vaccine we use today is the fourth polio vaccine , because the other three , after having been given to people for many years , were finally withdrawn because of mounting evidence of damage . #% While the European economy is performing strongly , we must also ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a society . #% 
I can not speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland , never mind the island of Ireland , because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world . #% I would also like to draw attention to another point that has to be investigated , that is , the rape of many Chinese women in Jakarta during the uprising . #% It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament . #% Strictly speaking , Parliament has no direct role in the matter ; it is a matter for the Council to approve . #% The committee 's foundation comes only a few days after a train carrying spent nuclear fuel flasks derailed as it arrived at the Torness power plant in Scotland . #% I would like to know what the Council ' s response to this is . #% I should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment . #% We are codecision makers , colegislators in this regard . #% Our electorate does not think that much of us that it wants the privilege of paying to have us as European political parties . #% After all , the Council is there to give a strategic lead . #% In this regard I compliment the Commissioner on his response to the most recent scare and share fully his views with regard to what has happened . #% That will is to say : ' Let us have much stronger measures for energy efficiency ' . #% The focus will be for on-farm forestry , with grants , planting and maintenance , as well as income-support premium . #% Likewise , environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective . #% Taoiseach , you have mentioned the importance of training and education and the connection with drug-taking in cities such as Dublin . #% We as a Parliament must resist the dilution and emasculation of legislation . #% It would only increase our farmers ' difficulty . #% It is a serious social and economic problem which everyone , including this Parliament and national governments , now recognises - late in the day , perhaps - and that we are now endeavouring to correct through rural development policy . #% The list is endless - take your pick . #% We have far too great a common bond . #% This is not strictly true . #% The estimated 2 500 lives a year that eCall could save throughout Europe is significant and therefore it needs to be taken seriously as a means of curbing high levels of road fatalities . #% The current proposal , which I support , will ensure continuity while negotiations for a new protocol are carried out in the course of this year . #% For instance , the EU-funded integrated coastal zone management projects such as the Atlantic Living Coastline in the UK and others have since ceased . #% Sixty-eight per cent of EU employment and over 60 % of wealth creation comes from the services sector and , therefore , services are the key driver for the sluggish EU economy . #% in writing . - The Commission 's proposal for a Small Business Act is part of a communication containing legislative proposals , guiding principles and measures to be implemented to help SMEs in Europe . #% It is a very serious problem for a very large number of borrowers who are finding it increasingly difficult to meet interest rates which prevailed five , six and seven years ago at treble the rate which we have at the present time . #% From an Irish perspective , with the Sellafield and Thorp nuclear installations only 60 miles from our shores , it is just unacceptable that the British Government can sign up for the European Energy Charter without its own nuclear industry being obliged to comply with those provisions . #% This does not mean that we lost 5.9 % : it means we lost a small fraction of this sum , perhaps 1 % of the entire budget . #% Having said that , I am all for balancing the taxation structure of motoring in order to decrease emissions - carbon emissions and particles and NOx and all the rest , but how that is done in each Member State is up to each Member State to decide and this is what we must be very careful about . #% I will not attempt to outline my objection to the CAP reform proposals in today 's budget debate , but I wish to make one very short and simple point : farmers need to plan ahead and they need policy stability . #% in writing . - On behalf of the Irish delegation to the EPP , We support the abolition of the death penalty and voted for the resolution on the World day against the death penalty . #% in writing . - I voted to oppose the measures in this report relating to the Mercosur Trade deal . #% When we speak about Plan D for democracy and so on and we put forward these plans , they must be based on what people want . #% While most of these initiatives were worthwhile in themselves , they were too numerous to implement in a single year . #% One of the issues which should be raised in this consumer campaign must relate , as has already been mentioned by the rapporteur , to the introduction of dual pricing in our shops and supermarkets in euros and in punts . #% I do not see why I should be penalised if all language translations are not available , and I would ask you to give a ruling , if not today , subsequently , that when a Member of Parliament tables a question in full accordance with the Rules , they are entitled to an answer at the appropriate time . #% We are not thinking about the countries we are robbing of their people , because our motives are selfish : we need to look after our own . #% While the energy mix must continue to remain a Member State competence , in a single market , an attack on one is an attack on all in energy terms . #% Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteurs for their work on what is a very difficult issue . #% Decoupling , taken together with the WTO proposals , will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat . #% Over the five years up to 2001 , for example , imports into the EU have included 5.4 million live birds , equal to 87 % of global trade , with Portugal and Spain being the main importers ; over one million live reptiles , equal to 16 % of global trade , with Spain and Germany being the main importers ; seven million live cacti and 15 million live orchids , mainly going to the Netherlands ; and 383 tonnes of sturgeon caviar , 40 % of the global trade , which went mainly to France and Germany . #% I wonder , Minister , if that means that you will be publicly putting pressure on Britain , Sweden and Finland , among others , to cease selling arms to places like Indonesia where they have been used in genocide campaigns against the East Timorese . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Mr President , I condemn the arrest of Ai Weiwei and call for his immediate release . #% Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak . #% So I am glad that we are now targeting cutting-edge research , particularly in areas like nano-technology , which will be very significant in the future . #% That is why I am not concerned in the least by the 10 % or the 25 % . #% I have a particular point to make as we look to the future : Europe needs to look beyond its borders and to ensure that our trade policy does not conflict with public health and food safety issues . #% The vast majority of the people of Gaza must rely on humanitarian aid for their very survival - food , water , shelter , clothes and , especially , medicine . #% Madam President , a few weeks ago this Parliament called for an end to payments to live cattle . #% Mr President , I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Lamassoure 's excellent work as rapporteur . #% Now I have no difficulty with having a political argument on ideology with anybody . #% It is important that we reflect on what has taken place , and remember that Parliament has insisted on its democratic and executive control over the Commission . #% I believe we should draw clear guidelines for the acknowledgement and publication of the very important financial contribution the European Union makes to human rights and development of the third world . #% This report calls for greater transparency which I am sure the majority of MEPs will support #% It is most important that we do not point the finger of blame at someone else from the Popular Party or from the Socialist Party , but encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite in finding a solution for all of the people of Spain and not to be driven down the road of division and dissension . #% The European car manufacturers must assume the costs of equipping all new manufactured cars with car phones in the interests of the medium to long-term future of road safety for car users and their passengers . #% This regulation will allow for housing renovation projects to draw on the ERDF but , in order to counter segregation risks , these initiatives must be part of a wider social integration framework in the fields of health , education and social affairs . #% Many factors , however , can contribute to a commercial decision to relocate a plant . #% There will be a 30 % increase in the number of vessels , which averaged 42 under the previous protocol , to 55 . #% Obviously , we must ensure security of supply of power in a sustainable way and we have an opportunity to look at alternative sources of power which we can exploit whilst , at the same time , helping the environment . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner . #% It is not a question of having done nothing alone . #% At that time , the Commission promised that liability for environmental damage caused by GMOs would be covered by horizontal legislation , but we have been waiting for more than 10 years for that promise to be fulfilled . #% This issue must be addressed at national and EU level . #% Though I note that the Commission had second thoughts , I feel we must hold it to its word . #% 
According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization , up to 450 people are dying there each day . #% There are excellent ideas in this document ; I am not trying to minimise them . #% We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates-general . #% The Palestinians see the EU as an honest and trustworthy broker . #% Unless we show them leadership and a sense of purpose , a sense of direction , they will make their judgements in the coming years . #% Identification of animals , issues of transport , insurance and many other matters came up apart from the vaccination issue . #% You have completed a very successful first presidency for Finland but you have done it with a capacity that does enormous credit to the tasks which you addressed . #% I agree with the proposal to introduce severe penalties where it is found that animals have been mistreated during production and during transport . #% In any other region of this Union , if this had happened and 40 % of an industry had been destroyed something decisive would have been requested of the national government and undertaken . #% The British - with due respect to all States in the Union - sent warships to Icelandic waters to ensure that their fishermen were protected when going there to fish the stocks in Icelandic waters . #% There is also a public confidence crisis . #% However , I agree with the Parliament 's amendments that remove the recommendations on automatic sanctions on Member States that incur an excessive deficit because , as this crisis has shown , it is necessary , in extraordinary circumstances , to exceed the deficit requirements in order to stave off more serious economic effects of a crisis . #% One very important step that the Member States could take would be to reverse their position on the abolition of duty-free sales for internal EU travel . #% My government recently announced its intention to develop Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in alternative energy . #% We all know that the lesson we have learned from that particular crisis in European farming is that we must have a food chain that guarantees the highest possible standards of traceability and safety . #% The Council 's 2005 report on human rights is a good summary of human rights activity and aspirations within the EU and the impact that such activity is having outside the Union . #% This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners . #% Even though I know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted , it should only be granted in the most exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology . #% I was opposed to it . #% This tax has made cars unnecessarily expensive in Ireland . #% Therefore , future agricultural and environmental policy must reflect our experiences in this crucial area of food production . #% Commissioner , a sine qua non for the end of international terrorism , and thereby a more peaceful world order , is the cessation of hostilities between the Israelis and Palestinians . #% Thirdly , I would like to express my appreciation for the moral support and political solidarity extended by Commissioner Patten . #% At previous sessions of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , when some Member States were raising China 's appalling human rights record , they were picked off one by one because of threatened trade sanctions by China . #% However , I was and I am totally opposed to the amendments which have been adopted and which support the harmonisation of taxes . #% In our history superpowers have always been detrimental to peace . #% Experimentation with human genes and more recently attempts to introduce ` terminator technology ' which ensures that crops will not produce reproductive seeds represents a frightening affront to the welfare of mankind . #% I call on colleagues to bear this in mind when making proposals on this matter . #% What exactly is your intention in relation to that ? #% Because the Commission is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operation of so many EU-sponsored policies , it should take particular note of its Treaty obligations in this regard . #% Is it not disgraceful that they are having to attract people from countries where those skills are needed ? #% I would like to ask the Commissioner , following on from his own response just now , with regard to access to buildings and discussions between the European Union authorities and the Belgian authorities , what plans , if any , he has in his role to consult with the disabled people themselves to ask them what access and what kind of special facilities they may need . #% I have had several meetings with junior doctors in Ireland over the last number of months with regard to this issue . #% Mr President , I join in the compliments to the rapporteur for her dedication . #% We need quite complex discussions on energy in the event of any sort of restructuring , which may well be an interesting idea . #% With oil prices rising and increasing environmental damage , we know the EU must now drive forward to a more sustainable society by becoming more energy efficient , by using more renewable energy , by investing in public transport and ensuring our children live in a clean and healthy environment . #% Choosing to ignore them is a short-sighted and counterproductive approach which not only goes against the principles guiding our external action but will also undermine the European social model . #% Mr President , this morning in the Irish press there was a very interesting report by the European Research Institute in Ispra . #% It is time we stopped this state of denial and faced reality . #% There is growing appreciation in Ireland that clean drinking water is a scarce resource and that all services , particularly the cost of distributing clean water to all households , have to be paid for . #% in writing . - I fully support MEP Angelilli 's own-initiative report and the recommendation to the Council on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography . #% It is quite clear right down the line , that this is basically about promoting and supporting the arms industry . #% More than 12 Members were opposed to the oral addition to Amendment No 1 #% When you fail to win the argument , you then attack the man : you carry out a personal attack because of his accent , because of the way in which he expresses himself . #% Do you feel that the mood amongst developing countries is such that we risk causing great disruption to the discussions if we insist , against their will , on pursuing the question of investment ? #% We want to share the benefits of EU membership with our neighbours from central and eastern Europe : to do otherwise would be to reject the concept and spirit of the Rome Treaty . #% How can the Commissioner justify bringing forward these proposed changes at a time when there has been a major review of the common agricultural policy ? #% Mr President , I take the opportunity offered by the Stihler report to remind the House that the common fisheries policy has evolved greatly over the last 20 years and is now a fully-fledged Community policy with specific objectives . #% I ask the Commission to act with haste . #% We want the General Affairs Council to do its business . #% The European Union , on the other hand , has all carrot and no stick . #% It is as evident in my country of Ireland as in any other EU Member State . #% There is point at which we have to arrive before that cooperation can really become effective . #% Would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which - remember - will have consequences long after our time here in the European Parliament ? #% That amendment genuinely sought to address many of the fears that Members had expressed as deficiencies in the Council 's response . #% This proposal is an intolerable interference with personal freedom of choice and liberty and typifies Brussels ' mindset of wishing to dictate every facet of our socio-economic life . #% I would urge that when we enter into the detailed negotiations on sugar we not only consider the economic and trade issues but also take on board the social and moral dimensions of our decisions . #% We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I too recognise the importance of Pakistan to all of us in the fight against terrorism and it has been an ally to all of us in that fight . #% This nationalistic approach in Parliament towards fisheries is extremely hard to accept from an ecological point of view . #% I support the terms of the today 's report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey 's EU membership . #% in writing . - The issue voted on refers to issues of regulation of media ownership . #% Finally , I agree entirely with Mr von Wogau . #% Why on earth , then , were we given the powers to do so ? #% Incursions by the Israeli military forces into Palestinian territories must be halted immediately and there must also be a lifting of restrictions that are imposed on the Palestinian people . #% We argue about amendments that the European public will not understand . #% 
I thank Commissioner Reding for her comprehensive reply . #% It has been very important because the maintenance , safety and development of our railway system throughout Europe have to be encouraged and not discouraged . #% We are now witnessing another milestone in the return to peace for future generations . #% It is not the same situation , but this example helps to illustrate how complex and sensitive these situations are and how the principle of subsidiarity should apply at all times . #% Each of us I am sure would wish to see action being taken to tackle the proceeds of cross-border crime and money laundering . #% The Commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans , but I was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and , indeed , if they include social conditionality . #% The Commission must now complete its consultation and swiftly bring forward ambitious proposals to ensure that governance of financial firms will help prevent , not facilitate , future crises . #% Controversial areas such as biotechnology must , in my view , be part of this equation . #% It would appear that she is basically a spokesperson for the military and for industry . #% But clearly there were , in Göteborg , anarchic groups whose essential , primary purpose was to undermine democracy itself . #% But the negotiations must also reflect Member States ' needs in light of the consolidation efforts under way in many countries , including Ireland . #% Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem . #% Mr President , Commissioner , colleagues , I believe today 's debate on both the EU 's urban agenda and the report on regional planning and European spatial development perspective raises two very important and yet related dimensions of European regional policy . #% At present , many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU/IMF programme of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks - both Irish and European - and the government . #% The human rights situation inside Burma within ethnic provinces is hugely concerning . #% While not wishing to dispute assurances given by researchers that the breakthrough is not aimed at creating a human being , the reality is that such a fundamental issue can not now be entrusted to individuals who are free to operate outside existing legislation . #% Can she say to what extent discussions have taken place with the Irish Government on the possibility of sub-dividing Ireland into a number of regions in the context of the regional policy programme expected to follow the present one which finishes in 1999 ? #% The possibility of strengthening the non-discrimination principle in the Treaty is under consideration at the IGC . #% However , I believe that the Commission is always under pressure to make excessive concessions to industrial fishing interests , and extending the right to fish for herring , even if some of it is of inferior quality , gives rise to serious doubts , even if Germany and Sweden did not catch their full quota in the Baltic . #% Let me say to Dr Paisley , when he talked about the votes he received , one vote for peace and reconciliation and an end of conflict is worth more than a thousand votes for a continuation of the conflict . #% If we decide to transfer responsibility for agricultural industry from the Member States to the European Union and discharge that responsibility more efficiently , the end result could in fact be a reduction in the burden of taxation . #% Instead of accepting compromises for the sake of political expediency , we should send this Monday morning directive back for redrafting under the better regulation initiative . #% I found myself pulled in a variety of ways over the years . #% Under the circumstances , when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should , the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive . #% The reason why I have asked to speak particularly tonight is because one of the amendments refers to my role as the mediator for the President of the European Parliament on transnationally abducted children . #% We all want clean water but the legislation we put in place must be adequate to achieve it . #% We should not be seen as an enemy of the Council and the Commission , nor as a subservient body , but as a willing and equal partner to them . #% The question is : can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191 ? #% Measures such as this will assist the competitiveness of regions , attract mobile investment and hopefully offset the tendencies for companies to set up in locations that are already congested . #% That is not just European progress but a measure of significant progress on the ground . #% When we questioned Commissioners Liikanen and Lamy , we did so objectively , asking questions about their role . #% In particular , we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis . #% It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so . #% The Commission seems to base its findings on certain research but to ignore other research that is available . #% We need to look at both these sectors , at how we are actually supporting them . #% We can all point to individual examples and different times when terrorist acts have so horrified us that we have wanted to respond according to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . #% The vast majority of people agree that the European Union must change the procedures it uses if it is to become a more effective political body in a Community of 25 Member States . #% Clearly there is a major problem with the lifting of the arms embargo on China , particularly in the light of what has happened in recent years . #% It is also only right that we as a European Parliament , as the directly-elected representatives of the European people , should be seen to give leadership in relation to the way the discussions and the debate should take place in the Member States . #% There is , however , a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects . #% It is perhaps a pity that this draft of the Irish presidency does not pose this question for it needs to be faced and , I would say , sooner rather than later . #% Ignoring now what is accepted as a real threat will only make the final solution more difficult to achieve . #% Whilst superficially proposing to increase nuclear safety , they hide their true purpose which is to revitalise a totally defunct nuclear industry . #% The House will be aware that my colleague Mr Ashworth 's report on simplification of the CAP was adopted in this House last May . #% Mothers can not be fathers and fathers can not be mothers . #% Irish milk chocolate - I was tempted to partake in the chocolate bar that was on display - is appreciated as a product of quality and provides high consumer satisfaction . #% Mr President , I would like first of all to congratulate you on your wonderful statement with regard to the celebration of International Women 's Day . #% Commissioner Byrne seems to have taken offence at this and seen it as some kind of snub . #% We can not shy away from the challenges , both economic and environmental , with which we are currently faced . #% The Ombudsman 's office clearly has resolved many problems , but it has not been in a position to resolve them all . #% I come from Ireland , a country whose economy has been transformed from little more than that of a poor , Third World country into one of the strongest in Europe , courtesy of European assistance through membership , and I wish all the same benefits and success to our ten new neighbours . #% The question is , can the European Union find a flexible way , through a joint action , of responding in a coordinated manner to any future situations that might arise where persons are temporarily in need of international protection ? #% In the area of rural development , there have been very significant initiatives in my own country , Ireland , to utilise EU funding such as through Leonardo to develop courses tailored to the needs of the rural economy . #% In other words , 19 % of people entitled to vote voted `` no '' and signalled an unwillingness to proceed with enlargement , because that was what Nice was about . #% The euro will be in open competition with the dollar for the title of the world ' s most counterfeited currency , unless we all make concerted efforts to ensure that the counterfeiters are defeated . #% When we had swine fever , we gave EUR 800 million to German and Dutch farmers . #% Following the adoption of a motion this week , I am delighted that the Parliament calls on the Commission to introduce emergency measures , including raising the current ceiling for State aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a transitional period of three years . #% We will have to deal with many more issues like that . #% We can return our attention to Africa and , while recognising the sovereignty of the African nations , we have to say that there will be conditions attached to our development aid . #% It is discussed in Daíl Éireann and is a key component of our annual budget . #% We have seen that there has been market opening in some countries to 100 % of customers , that there has been an unbundling of network operators in all Member States to some extent , but not completely , and there has been a limited increase in clarity and transparency of regulation . #% Nevertheless , it must be acknowledged that a thriving and efficient private sector can play a major role in developing the economy of third countries and in combating poverty . #% I should like to ask him if he is aware that , notwithstanding the implementation of many of the Community programmes , in a recent BBC television programme Newsnight there was clear evidence that there is a systematic breeding programme in Romania in particular , where children are being bred for export and sale . #% If we wish to be serious about how we develop people 's opportunities and give them the tools of freedom and independence , then giving and assisting in employment is one of the most important tools for combating poverty and exclusion . #% By means of this directive no leaded petrol will be sold anywhere in Europe after January 2000 , except where severe socio-economic problems would arise . #% Mr President , in noting the delay in the implementation of the packaging waste directive that the accession states are to be allowed , I wish to say that , from our experience in Northern Ireland , they are fortunate to escape its requirements for several years . #% 
The accession of the ten new countries hailing from the former Soviet bloc and Yugoslavia , the Baltics and the Mediterranean is , undoubtedly , the most significant and historic event in the history of the Union . #% We have brought ourselves to the point of accepting that , although it may not come out of the IGC , for indirect tax , but not yet for direct tax . #% The directive will apply to accidents involving nationals of a Member State of the Union on Union territory or in any third country operating the Green Card system . #% I thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive reply . #% Like my colleagues I would like to emphasize the role for space education . #% Let me finish by saying that we have taken the lead in the EU on these issues , but it would be regrettable if , in pursuit of a trade deal , we were to sacrifice our standards and the health of our animals and of our citizens . #% Mr President , the UN sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction , claiming at least 200 children 's lives every day . #% I would like to express my full confidence in Commissioner Pinheiro and his team of negotiators who I know will make every effort to conclude an agreement in line with the negotiating mandate they have been given by the Council of Ministers ; a mandate which did not reflect the public statements or commitments given by heads of state or government to President Mandela which , of course , raised very highly the level of expectations in South Africa . #% I would warn against complacency . #% Everyone here will be familiar with the history of this particular application . #% There is a real urgency about this and we need to start thinking outside the box . #% We discover that the modest amount they have earned on these short-term schemes is also being used to keep them out of the retirement scheme . #% Nor must we lose sight of the fact that the core and single most important component for the development of rural regions is the maintenance of sustainable agriculture at the very heart of their economies . #% It would be a terrible blow to the democratic process if the people of Europe were not asked their opinion on this matter . #% So , if possible , that vote should be dealt with again . #% Mr President , the common fisheries policy , as many have pointed out , has failed to conserve fish stocks at adequate levels to support a viable industry . #% Now the Commission has proposed a substantial cut in compensation payments to the cereal sectors . #% Live exports are an important feature of Ireland 's cattle sector . #% The idea of protection for those who are most vulnerable within our society is at the very core of what the European social model should be about . #% People are dying daily because they are caught up in a drug underworld which is making millions from their misery . #% One of the lessons learned from my report on the control of the CFP was that even the EU vessels registries were not accurate . #% Article 301 of the penal code remains in place to punish those responsible for ` a public denigration of Turkishness or State authorities ' . #% : I voted for the report by Mr de Roo today for several important reasons . #% These are questions which I think all European citizens want to have answered . #% What we are discussing here today is the revision of the original 1993 regulation which put in place the Community Eco-Management and Audit scheme . #% Mr President , I wish to raise my concern that the Irish Government is not fully respecting the minimum legal and humanitarian standards for the reception and processing of immigrants and asylum seekers that have been established by the European Union . #% Madam President , I will be supporting the new Commission tomorrow at the vote in the European Parliament , but my heart is heavy . #% In addition to being a day set aside for religious observance , Sunday is also a day dedicated to family responsibilities and to recreation . #% There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment . #% By this means we should begin to decouple ourselves from what has been a very difficult , but useful experience , but one that remains , unfinished as it is , deeply embarrassing and complicated as we have seen recently by the deplorable choices of Dr Martin Bangemann . #% From there on , the entire system is redundant and farmers within the system have absolute certainties while farmers outside the systems will deal with the problems just like any other sector in their economy - manufacturing , industry , services , importing or exporting . #% So now that we have gained some experience of drafting regulations , I think we have learned a bit about how to go about it . #% State aircraft have been exempted . #% We had the possibility for large amounts of fraud and racketeering through the payment of monetary compensatory amounts . #% We can not prepare a vaccine in advance or stockpile it . #% Up until now there has been little evaluation of EU assistance measures either by the Member States or the EU Commission . #% It was a tragedy of immense proportions , as has already been pointed out , resulting in over one thousand deaths and many thousands more being injured . #% Europe has been accused of making a mountain out of a molehill but the truth is that we are in a very difficult position . #% So , we will stop short of fully engaging in all the ambitions of this report , while at the same time not necessarily objecting to the evolution of thinking in that general direction . #% The aim of this legislation is to enable Member States to meet their Kyoto targets by containing the leakage and restricting the use of fluorinated gases . #% By doing this , the Commission is encouraging a culture of secrecy where Member States are not providing the information . #% What did we achieve in conciliation ? #% This will be a unique sporting and cultural experience for the athletes taking part , from 160 international delegations all over the world . #% While this is in line with the Treaty , we do not live in a vacuum : outside influences and policies have an impact on Europe 's internal checks and balances . #% If we can not be sure that fish are available these particular species should not be put in the agreement . #% This is because , if that young child needs the constant reassuring presence of its mother , not having her will have an impact , despite all the very worthy reasons for her absence . #% Instead it called on the US to adopt a strategy of constructive engagement with the Burmese authorities to maintain economic links with Burma while pushing for change . #% In relation to amendments which use the term ` Republic of Ireland ' , I would like to recall for colleagues that the official name of my country is Ireland . #% Lastly , I hope the reforms do what the Commissioner says they will do : give us a competitive sugar industry . #% I am also calling on the European Union and the airlines to improve access for disabled passengers , children and the elderly and to prohibit European Union airlines from charging an extra fee for assisting persons who are immobile onto any aeroplane within the European Union . #% To those who would say that it is only a semantic distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning , I say : I have a butcher 's knife in my hand , I can cut up your steak with it quite legally , or I can cut your head off with it quite illegally - proper sanctions , proper penalties . #% As an Irish MEP , I am acutely aware of how we are being told to implement austerity measures and the real fear is that this will smother any opportunity for growth . #% Mr President , the implications of Agenda 2000 are of great importance to my country , Ireland . #% Mr President , I apologise for being late . #% Obviously , the most important and topical challenge facing consumer policy is indeed the BSE crisis . #% On the serious matter of falsifying records , the UK average fine was EUR 132 000 while in Germany it was a derisory EUR 98 -- but EUR 98 more than in the Republic of Ireland which , according to those official Commission figures , had no penalties to declare in 2003 , although it belatedly admitted that it had 103 serious infringements ! #% We need an equivalent of the Euratom Treaty for renewable energy . #% The committee is simply paying lip service to the idea and continuing with business as usual . #% But still , contrary to research , the old spurious arguments are trotted out ; ` it could be evaded , it would be a burden on consumers ' . #% Earlier this week the US-ASEAN Business Council , which represents the cream of American and South-East Asian business people , made a strong denunciation of economic sanctions against Burma . #% Can you be sure , Commissioner , that an enlightened view will be taken , in particular by Mr Monti , the Commissioner responsible for competition , to ensure that we have private sector innovative approaches to reducing regional disparities across the Union ? #% I would like to underline to you , as I have done in my report , a number of points that I feel strongly about . #% There have been key developments taking place in this regard , which have been mentioned by others . #% But one should remember that , between 1982 and 1992 , the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked ; they are getting less now , and there was a generous amount of money . #% The psychological impact on farmers and rural communities is considerable . #% In the past that would have shown a constant increase in nuclear power . #% 
We must get intervention - medical and educational - to all those thousands of people , especially children who , since the New Year , have become disabled for life . #% By his own standards , Mr Milosevic has learned the lessons of Bosnia and is applying them . #% For ten stocks they adopted an increase where the Commission had recommended a decrease . #% Roaming prices for a four-minute call still vary from as little as 20 cents for a Finnish consumer calling from Sweden to EUR 13.05 for a Maltese consumer in Latvia . #% About 85 % of the people arriving in Ireland have not been stopped at the original port of call or processed in the country in which they originally arrived in the Community . #% What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area ? #% I think that is a gross insult to those who want to see duty-free retained . #% I would appeal to the IGC to listen to this Parliament , to the Convention and the 200 parliamentarians - from all sides of the political spectrum , both in government and in opposition right across Europe who produced the Convention document . #% Those that enforce the rule of law must always operate within the law . #% in writing . - I support this report which extends eligibility of housing interventions in marginalised communities to the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) . #% Finally , the European Commission should allocate greater financial resources to investigating the causes of , and possible cures for , Alzheimer 's disease . #% Codecision is not negotiable . #% Nonetheless , I should like to ask you what measures Parliament 's security services have taken to detect similar bugging and spying devices within the newly-built Parliament offices . #% However , the call to the Commission to boost its input to the library sector by establishing a focal point to coordinate library affairs and to oversee developments will be universally welcomed . #% That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear . #% We know that . #% Shame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general . #% In addition , as Mr Hughes pointed out , the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately . #% That should not be in his report . #% I hope that goes for the people of Spain as well . #% Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients . #% It is up to us as legislators and as rule makers to ensure that the legislation and the regulations that we put down do not impede private industry and private business to give them the right atmosphere , the right opportunity in which to thrive and to grow . #% That will not be the case since those concerned about the issues will not be swayed to support it simply because it was finalised during that presidency . #% The solution to this problem may not be as hard as some EU airlines may envisage . #% Opposing this measure will have the effect of excluding many women from the labour force , thereby losing a valuable resource . #% There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being . #% The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general . #% Fishermen must have sufficient holiday time and a maximum limit to working time but I am seriously concerned about the damage to the industry that could result from an inflexible attitude . #% Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region . #% Mr President , due to the time constraints imposed by you , which give my colleagues a chance of having their questions answered , can I very quickly thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% We must not get to a situation where Member States are able to draw false conclusions , undermining our spending programmes where we know that they are vital to citizens ' opportunities . #% Will questions to the Commission - ostensibly due between 6.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. be taken ? #% We have to continue to have our substantial development needs looked after post-1999 . #% It would be virtually impossible to quantify these subsidies which have been embedded in the industry over decades of generator construction . #% As welcome and as necessary as the work of the EU Ombudsman is , that office is not a panacea for the European Union 's democratic deficit . #% These are their channels and their programmes and they have the ownership of this community-building peace programme . #% Just to refer to the Commissioner 's response to Mr Aylward 's original question with regard to the transferability of sugar quotas . #% We have the instruments available . #% For many years the Irish people have lived under a cloud of unease as the Sellafield plant has stumbled from one safety misdemeanour to another . #% I do not believe that the present proposals constitute a reasonable basis for negotiation . #% With regard to China , the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying , having dramatically increased the number of executions in China , often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials . #% To date , the Council has failed to heed these calls . #% So why does it need to be put off until December ? #% I disagree fundamentally with that approach . #% Whilst the modern car is 40 times cleaner than its equivalent in the 1980s , air quality will be greatly enhanced by the implementation of the proposals before the House . #% The Commission should ensure that no public health side effects arise from the uncontrolled recycling of PVC products . #% Allowing the Azores to export relatively small quantities of sugar to the EU has to be a good decision for the economic future of that particular region . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Bauer for her hard work . #% And the man who ordered the killing still struts the streets of Belfast in the company of the IRA 's chief of intelligence , Bobby Storey , and leading provisional IRA man , Eddy Copeland . #% Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe , we need to be realistic . #% I hope , Commissioner , you will encourage the cooperation that is required . #% We all know that the enlargement process can not take place unless there is some reform in the decision-making procedures within the European Union itself . #% By seeking to spread the blame to criminals generally for the monstrous murder of Robert McCartney , the GUE/NGL resolution and the amendment by the Verts/ALE Group naively allows Sinn Féin and the IRA to wash their hands of the known complicity of the members of the IRA before , during and after the murder and should not , therefore , be supported by this House . #% The difficulty , however lies in bringing them together . #% There is little or no point in the European Union developing a trade policy based on liberal , free-market principles if our competitors continue to operate restrictive practices in their domestic markets . #% But over the next few weeks the Commission should and must carry out a full and independent evaluation of all the environmental public health risks of all operations of BNFL at the Sellafield nuclear plant . #% I await the bringing forward of specific programmes and measures in which stakeholders in the tourist industry can participate . #% The summit at the end of this month will give us the opportunity - which we should grasp - to begin building that new future . #% That we expect of you . #% We are mad . #% This allows tobacco manufacturers to continue to plead ignorance of any detrimental effects on human health of these additives . #% There has long been a need to create a European company to complement this picture . #% Can you offer any advice in this situation ? #% I believe it is essential that the EU clean up these aspects of its fisheries if it is to be committed to a sustainable fisheries policy . #% US experience tells us that software patents do not encourage innovation and R&D but , in fact , weaken the market and suffocate small and medium-sized enterprises , as well as those starting out in the market . #% One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in Europe . #% 
What action is the Commission taking to ensure that Member States are properly applying the laws in this regard ? #% We hope that the modernising influences within Turkish politics and society will now take hold of this opportunity and build on it in a positive way . #% Mr President , I should like to ask you to inform the Commission that the Irish Ferries company is looking to fire its entire workforce and replace it with cheaper labour using the device of reflagging in Cyprus in order to avoid Irish , British and French labour law . #% But , looking at this rural development plan , which seeks to promote the complementary activities , while reducing and taking money from the primary activity -- family farming -- I can only say the plan is crazy , and in the Irish context , will destroy the very rural communities it purports to enrich . #% There is the will to grasp the opportunity to have a treaty , to be called , I suppose , EURENEW . #% Mr President , we have to address this question of the ageing of our population from the point of view of having a society for all ages , as our motion indicates . #% It is therefore necessary for this House to recognise recreational angling in all its forms as an important stakeholder in the fishing industry , and for the reformed common fisheries policy to take its economic and social benefits into account in its White Paper . #% I have noted the importance of in voting to-day . #% Much of the pollution that occurs in Community waters , as has been said already , is either deliberate or avoidable . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Böge on his report and especially his highlighting of the importance of investment in research and development with a view to meeting the Lisbon Agenda objectives . #% On behalf of my group I salute the progress which has been made there . #% Coming from a maritime region of the Union , I am acutely aware of the preciousness of our marine resources and the need for sustainable activities , which assure these resources for future generations . #% I , too , in the short period that I have want to welcome the Agreement and to say that I sincerely hope it will be supported by the vast majority of the people of Ireland , North and South . #% We have accepted great support from the European Union since we joined it and we are prepared to give back a great deal of what we received . #% The Commission has always undertaken the duties and responsibilities it has been given in an even-handed and fair manner . #% Social policy must be tailored to the needs of the individual countries . #% I think there is unity in diversity and I would like to say that I feel myself very much a soulmate of the honourable Member in raising this question . #% If , for example , we can get the majority of the Member States to support this policy and to adopt it , then of course we would like to see the Commission support it as well . #% Today we are at Community average . #% Sadly , it is also capable of causing grave disappointment when such qualities are absent . #% Regulation of F-gases has led to toxic graveyards of leaking fridges in some countries . #% The Treaty forms the basis for future discussions at the IGC , which will finalise the provisions of a new European Treaty . #% It is necessary constantly to review regulation in this area , as new scientific evidence and testing is constantly being developed . #% However , I was looking for something more specific , if possible , under three headings . #% I just want to make one point in relation to this whole issue of foot-and-mouth . #% The original Commission proposal has also turned out to be technically impossible and the financial resources destined for its development have been partly wasted . #% Their chief executive recently earned a personal bonus of # IRL 17 million . #% Nine hours is about right . #% I do not agree with those who believe the boundaries of Europe should be narrow and exclusively Christian . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues for their contributions , as well as the shadow rapporteurs , the secretariat of the Fisheries Committee , the Council , the Commission , my group 's policy adviser , and indeed my own adviser . #% I can certainly recommend Amendment No 2 and I will leave it to the judgment of the House as to how we should vote on Amendment No 3 . #% It has been a creation out of necessity -- the necessity that we now face before us . #% The PEACE programme is of much more than purely financial importance to Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland . #% Would he agree that there are already an increasing number of Irish people who speak the language and that the number of people being educated through Gaeilge in Ireland has increased dramatically , particularly over the last 20 years ? #% Given that this is the European headquarters of the European Parliament one would have thought that every mechanism would be in place to ensure that Members get here . #% We also strongly support the protection of human rights and we are always strengthening legislation to protect the environment . #% Given the volume of beef and sheepmeat that is entering the EU at present levels of protection , it is equally certain that most , if not all , of the gap in the EU market created by the reduction in EU supplies will be filled by products from third countries . #% They also employ 1.4 million people . #% In my own country , Ireland , there has been an almost 20 % drop in farm incomes this year when inflation is factored in . #% Their only alternative is to remain working with Irish Ferries and earn approximately 50 % of their current salary . #% Lift those stringent measures ? #% Mr President , I would like to say at the outset that I am fully against flights of rendition . #% Ratification would confer legitimacy on a quasi-military regime , responsible for human rights abuses , a ` flawed ' general election and nuclear proliferation . #% At times , the pressure on Parliament to cave in , to divide , to give up our legislative role , was barely tolerable . #% We now have , in the Buitenweg report , a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan . #% The Credit Union movement in Ireland and the UK is unique . #% I do not have the time to develop any kind of linguistic or analytical subtlety on my next point . #% in writing . - MEPs have received more than 400 petitions concerning widespread misleading business practices by business directory companies affecting thousands of mostly small businesses . #% I would argue that we need to look closely in Solvency II at what regulators are expected to do and separate out those two functions . #% The British Government has failed since 1989 to recognize the gravity of the situation . #% One thing that we have all recognised in the past is that we have not made proper provision for the future needs of changing demographics , a reducing workforce in certain cases and limits in taxation expenditure . #% I believe that this agency should be established without delay . #% The work undertaken by the Irish presidency has already established many of the yardsticks we need to follow . #% There is the persecution of disabled people in some communist countries and the persecution based on tribal origin in the Sudan . #% It can be done ; the technology is there . #% I voted against Amendment 81 to totally reject this report . #% We are now 34 million over the planned budget due to demands for yet more staff and other start-up costs , and the EEAS is n't even operational ! #% We vote here , we go home and we forget that in a couple of years the votes we take here are implemented in Member States . #% Mr President , I share the views of the majority of the speakers here this afternoon that the collapse of the talks was a major blow , both to the WTO itself and to the global economy . #% The conflict of interest that arises if the party 's own insurers or their opponent 's carry out the settlement is self-evident . #% The Irish Hotels Federation is already reporting actual losses of EUR 55 million in the last month , with obvious knock-on consequences for employment . #% It must be a step in a two -- state solution . #% I urge support for compromise amendment 50 , and amendment 99 dealing with CO2 emitted from the decarbonation of limestone to produce lime , which makes an important , environmentally friendly contribution to the market . #% The budget totals of # 506bn will put in place various programmes to lay the foundation for the impending enlargement of the European Union itself . #% I also want to thank Mr Bourlanges , who laid out the strategy for this report . #% I also believe that an international peace conference that does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists in the Middle East will not succeed , nor will it get off the ground . #% 
That loophole must be closed . #% I support the call for the Commission to bring forward proposals for further progress on this matter and for the Council to adopt the principle of application of the open coordination method and a detailed timetable at the European Council next June , and for the Member States to lay down common objectives and indicators by the European Council in 2006 . #% Today I speak as the representative of a city in Ireland that is the present capital of culture : Cork . #% Indeed , the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU . #% It is completely unacceptable that a person , even if denied asylum , should be treated worse than an animal would be treated . #% They offer citizens a point of information that is centrally and visibly located in their own Member State . #% It is for this reason that when we all discuss the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 , we must remember the commitments we made to farmers in the past in relation to the single farm payment , and indeed to rural development , and we must put our money where our mouths are . #% It is important for us as a Parliament to recognize our role in bringing to fruition the ideas of what the people of Europe want to see . #% I shall give you one example : In the innovative computer technology sector in Ireland , there are 100 00 jobs , 62 000 of which are in small and medium-sized enterprises . #% In this respect , it is worth mentioning the work of KIMO International and their ` Fishing for Litter ' Project . #% Industry needs to be allowed to place on the market equine veterinary products that do not have MRLs , to be used according to the cascade principle , with a record of treatment and exclusion from the food chain . #% I think the media should investigate where the weapons that the Hutus are now using are coming from . #% This report seeks to urge a better application of Aarhus , but we in Ireland have no application . #% It is a completely separate fuel sector which has also fertiliser as a component . #% The EU policy in the fight against financial fraud is pursued simultaneously under the first and third pillars of the Treaties . #% The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure , making water and airborne infectious disease rampant . #% At the heart of the issue is the failure to implement properly the 1973 First Non-life Assurance Directive and subsequent relevant directives . #% Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where schooling is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife . #% The Chinese regime is increasing its repression , and that repression has increased since the Chinese Stalinists decided to go for the capitalist market as a means of developing the economy . #% I am genuinely pleased with the response to it by the people who have already spoken . #% Women have to be two or three times better than men if they are to get anywhere , to actually achieve anything . #% This is the approach that the Irish Government intends to take in its role as presidency . #% A democracy , by its very nature , needs the safety valve of humour and offence in order to operate properly . #% Surely they must have some rights under EU law as EU citizens . #% Any suspension of aid must be decided by the Council of Ministers by qualified majority after the European Parliament , but we must ensure that any financial aid and debt relief is organised in such a way as to ensure that some corrupt African leaders , without mentioning names , can not rearm themselves to bolster highly questionable regimes . #% That has left us with a serious legacy of decay and decline with out-of-date structures and over-capacity in our water and sewage works . #% Clear evidence has emerged that the police , the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder . #% Commissioner , you mentioned the Hague Convention of 1996 which , thankfully , was recognised last November . #% I do not regard that as a very democratic system and it is certainly not a system which fully reflects the views of the Members who spoke here . #% On this occasion I simply want to draw the attention of colleagues to the machinations of the Commission which I believe could have damaging consequences . #% They do not want to hear about moral issues . #% The text as voted by Parliament runs the risk of potentially putting innocent consumers in prison , while at the same time creating loopholes for individual criminals engaged in organised and serious crime . #% I have been campaigning for the establishment of an EU Coastguard for a number of years . #% Two things worry the farmers of Europe at the moment : the excessive paperwork they are required to do and the restrictions that are being imposed on them . #% . -- We are all excited at the way in which electronic communications and technology are put to use and their subsequent effects on our collective economies . #% I am convinced that the introduction of the new procedure would also be in the interests of the intended beneficiaries of our financial instruments . #% This funding must not be prioritised unfairly to the new Member States , with gross disadvantage to the EU-15 . #% It also includes a litany of unreported incidents , falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel rods resulting in the loss of confidence by the Japanese in safety standards at the plant and the cancellation by the Germans and the Swiss of mixed oxide nuclear fuel pellets . #% It was an outrage , and continues to be an outrage , that we develop these weapons . #% In any case , the UK and Ireland will persist as centres of excellence for nonconventional medicine . #% I was hoping the Commissioner was late because he was putting the final touches to the evaluation of Malta . #% I also praise the rapporteur for his excellent work and his highly technical dossier . #% I do not agree with all the details in the proposals before Parliament this morning . #% Car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances . #% This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important , targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen . #% The risk of accidents , with which Mr Seppänen 's report and your draft directive are concerned , has also been strengthened because of 11 September , as has the even more serious security question which is now facing us . #% Where I come from -- and I am going to be parochial for a little while -- we are lucky to have any rail links left at all . #% Very recently the authorities have brought in new legislation for separate single-sex hospitals . #% It goes back to colonial times when the British came back from the colonised countries and hung their trophies on the wall . #% While the European Union remains one of the major donors , both the UNHCR and the World Food Programme are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to run the refugee camps . #% Above all we must open up this subject and be inclusive to those who are suffering in this particular area . #% People must come first ! #% Strategically , air transport is of critical importance , particularly for peripheral regions and islands such as Ireland . #% I particularly appreciate the efforts of successive presidencies to find a solution to the outstanding problems linked to the original Commission proposal on the DCECI . #% My response to Barcelona is one of relief that the hype about liberalisation and privatisation was in fact just hype , that the balance of political power on the Council still remains with the centre-left , with the common sense to know that the people of Europe want a social Europe as well as a market Europe , and that the balance between social policy and economic policy , of employment policy and sustainability needs to be maintained . #% I am satisfied that the 1957 European Convention as supplemented by the new EU convention relating to extradition provides a very good framework for extradition arrangements between Member States in relation to serious offences . #% However I asked a slightly different question and I think it might still be possible for it to be answered . #% There is an assumption that all Member States should ultimately reach the same recovery and recycling rates , irrespective of size , geography or infrastructure . #% The fifteen governments of the Union should also be in a position to freeze the assets of terrorists and those involved in organised and international crime . #% The alarming rise of the incidence in animals of tuberculosis and brucellosis highlights the need for immediate action against these diseases . #% It is a major blow to the public 's right to choose alternative forms of medicine , the right to try and avoid relying on pharmaceutical industries and their products . #% However , the White Paper mentioned by Mr Bowis that the Commission brought forward outlines a raft of directives and regulations that need to be updated and modernised so as to make the food chain in Europe safer . #% Mr President , Council meetings in the last few months have probably had the most important agendas for several years , dealing with three areas in fisheries management : first , the size of the EU fishing fleet under the MAGP ; the new regulations for technical measures proposed by the Commission ; and satellite transponders , an important aspect of the overall control programme . #% As far as Mr Blair is concerned I believe he is the first British Prime Minister ever to make Ireland a priority . #% If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do . #% US President Reagan was famously quoted as saying about Saddam Hussein `` he ' s a sonofabitch , but he ' s our sonofabitch '' . #% 
I would like to ask would he assure this Parliament that the establishment of a policy planning and early warning unit as envisaged under the Amsterdam Treaty will be given top priority ? #% Mr President , in relation to the Minutes , has any progress been made by yourself and your offices in the matter of correspondence with a Member of this House who made charges of a serious criminal nature in respect of the buildings policy of the institution ? #% I would have liked the Commissioner to be much more willing to disburse budgetary support to a country despite it not being on track as regards certain non-core elements of the IMF/PRGF and where IMF programmes are judged to be too restrictive . #% It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years . #% I would agree with Mrs Pollack that simply to include the urban dimension in Objective 1 and 2 programmes is not sufficient . #% Since the Whitehead report was adopted in the Committee on Environment , a number of major events have taken place , the most important being the transfer of responsibility for food safety to DG XXIV . #% Irish companies and other European companies are trying to make a reality of the single market and tackle the challenges of globalisation head on , and the governments touting protectionism should not stand in their way . #% If he is not aware , I would strongly suggest that the Council familiarises itself with this situation . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews . #% Given the importance of conservation this report falls very far short of what is really required . #% Many young people from rural areas some 20 , 30 or 40 years ago , at the time Mr McCartin was speaking about , would naturally have gone on to become young farmers . #% I am very glad to see that the Commission is on our side on this , but it needs to put much more pressure on the British Government to behave in a responsible manner . #% However , a commercially successful Irish airline competing in the European market , Ryanair , is currently engaged in a protracted trade dispute with its employees arising from the company 's refusal to recognize or negotiate with the trade union chosen by some of the employees to represent them or to cooperate with the national industrial conciliation procedures which have been established to resolve such disputes . #% We are the body with the political competence to take into account the substantial and professional work of the Court of Auditors . #% However , the prime responsibility rests with the Irish Government . #% When there is a demand for live animals , we have to meet this demand within the strict rules and regulations outlined of course . #% Neither of them would ever come forward with any positive support to help the fishermen . #% His report is a comprehensive one , which makes an important contribution to the debate on the evolving EU security policy as defined by the Maastricht Treaty and accepted at the time by all Member State governments . #% However , they are worth repeating . #% Despite our diplomatic efforts so far , none of the conditions set by the sixth ASEM Ministerial meeting in Ireland last year , including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi as a minimum condition , has been fulfilled by the Burmese dictatorship . #% The great concern that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party took to this debate was to ensure that we should be able to protect appropriate diversity . #% Extra national funding is , therefore , the only resort and has to be found . #% I think Mrs Banotti referred to it but as I could not hear her , because I was getting Swedish at the time , I do not really know what she said . #% Now , you made a comment during your remarks and maybe you will reply or enlarge on it : you said that eggs from outside the EU not meeting equivalent standards would have a different mark . #% The Commission must strictly manage the animal welfare provisions and ensure that they are respected throughout the European Union for animals imported and exported . #% I would ask the European Commission to take into consideration standards of human rights in all the aid schemes and cooperation schemes that the European Union puts into effect . #% In fairness to him - and I do not agree with everything that he says on most occasions - he has also brought forward short-term , medium-term and long-term priorities that must be carried out . #% The European research area is of course important . #% Responsible political leaders in London must now take the initiative and reassure the British people that they have nothing to fear from their neighbours in the European Union . #% Personally I feel that if we defended our external borders in the Union as carefully as we sometimes watch the internal Member State borders , we would do more service to the Union . #% We have seen from Johannesburg and from Kyoto and elsewhere that they do not pay a jot of attention to what we say . #% We have had much talk but we have had no great success to date . #% There is a need to address that issue . #% Mr President , I welcome this report and the Commission 's response to Parliament 's amendments . #% Having consulted with nutrition experts from the University of Ghent and from Trinity College Dublin , I am convinced that the concept is not grounded in solid science and will have the adverse effect of depriving consumers of a great deal of information . #% I respect the rights of other Member States , but they must respect our right and listen to our concerns and act on them . #% I am now calling on the British Government to bring forward a full and comprehensive environmental impact assessment outlining the environmental risks of transporting of nuclear materials within the Irish Sea . #% There are one or two points of concern . #% So , it is not just a question of the technical matters relating to repatriation . #% But I do not want a market where competition rules supreme . #% Why are we shutting down sugar production when we desperately need to find alternatives to petroleum fuels ? #% The recent outbreaks of violence in Nigeria are emblematic of a wider problem that faces the country . #% Perhaps he could clean up the litter . #% However , I can not agree that compliance with 3 out of 20 recommendations is progress . #% Mr President , one of the clear messages from this report today is the need to introduce procedures which will simplify the Structural Funds payments regime in Europe . #% If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job . #% Mr President , at the outset I want to take the opportunity of congratulating Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on the preparation and presentation of his report . #% . This proposal is part of an ongoing review of the legislation to prevent and combat future outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Classical Swine Fever . #% Mr President , from an agricultural and rural development perspective , the delivery of EU policy objectives , taken in tandem with the most recent CAP reform , means that EU farmers can now plan to meet the challenging agenda of food security , quality and high environmental standards . #% We were way behind when this started and over the last five years have almost caught up . #% The non-agricultural industrial market access negotiations must deliver tariff reductions for all products . #% Through EU-level and Member state incentives , we must seriously target the development and mainstreaming of the 21 types of renewables , not least because of our obligations in relation to climate change . #% I have lobbied for genuine refugees in my own country , largely unsuccessfully . #% However , I know that in the future you will recognise it depends very much on who is asking the question , and then you will decide whether or not you should come . #% Subsidies for traditional forms of energies have been intense and are partly responsible for limited progress on renewables . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU . #% Both gentlemen highlighted the lack of progress to date at the IGC negotiations . #% Nor can it rewrite it or change e-Commerce law , in particular the responsibility of ISPs as defined in Articles 12 to 15 of the e-Commerce directive . #% I understand why the same public is now asking why they should fund bail-outs in other countries . #% The only thing that has changed is its PR approach . #% We can learn some things from the experience we have already gained . #% At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna . #% Enlargement will surely offer opportunities to our regions but we will want to ensure that the proposals presented by the Commission match our objectives and priorities as socialists , namely to continue the Delors legacy of promoting jobs , sustainable growth and the competitiveness of our regions and the central objective of economic and social cohesion of the Treaty to enable all citizens , regions and Member States to participate on an equal footing . #% We must not underestimate the challenges we face in the run-up to the accession of the ten countries to the European Union . #% Why can we not establish the sustainability of a wild bird or a species before trade begins ? #% We are dealing with cold waters late at night in the middle of December and it seems that only the EPP has the nerve to go swimming . #% 
in writing . - I support this report on the work of the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) - EU Parliamentary Assembly . #% It must be seen to deliver . #% This is a staggering level of violence and hatred by any standards . #% I am very pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here to listen to this debate . #% Joint action to help combat this growing problem could also be taken under the European Union 's common foreign and security policy . #% I come from one of those islands , the island of Ireland that does not have a tunnel connecting the rest of Europe , or indeed a land bridge . #% What we bring forward from the Lisbon process and the Lisbon summit , most importantly of all , is access to education , training , learning and knowledge . #% Of those 746 vessels , at least 38 were directly exported to known flag of convenience countries . #% This report would update and strengthen existing measures for combating these abhorrent behaviours , and define them as criminal offences , punishable by law . #% That , of course , is in anticipation of the EU Constitution , within which that harmonisation has a key role to play . #% But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised , in Germany they have not , yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands . #% The reason given was that they could no longer compete with cheap imports from Asia and South America . #% I think it is a very good outcome for us : Parliament has gained , insofar as we have maintained codecision under Article 179 , which is a very important principle to us . #% This should come under the articles of Europol , the European police agency in The Hague . #% Part of the problem is the burden of excessive legislation and bureaucracy . #% It is a very welcome precedent . #% It is clearly explained in the recitals to the regulation that the main aim is to contribute to global warming reduction targets . #% I am absolutely horrified . #% I note what has been said about EPSO and I would urge that greater efforts be made to remove the difficulties which exist there . #% The European Parliament is not a court of law . #% This kind of approach , separating development from what is actually being paid for the fishing rights is extremely important , as has been mentioned by other speakers . #% I supported the overall impact of the Bösch report . #% I am not interested in promoting European Union decision-making founded on institutional stalemate . #% Mr President , the whole principle of fingerprinting asylum-seekers , as far as I am concerned , is intolerable . #% I am very disappointed that Ireland voted for this agreement , thus giving the green light to unwarranted intrusions into the privacy of Irish passengers . #% Far from not wanting new ways at European or Member Statelevel of approaching this problem , I am one of the most ardent supporters of new approaches and I am the Minister responsible - as it happens , at the Prime Minister 's office - for local development in my own country . #% The Greens are voting against this agreement , as we do with all third-country agreements . #% It is also clear that negotiations on the provisions of the new EU treaty are being somewhat fast-tracked . #% No normal process of law has been put into effect against them . #% It was quite clear from the result that the majority in this House wanted that resolution passed today and it would have been an absolute tragedy if it had been deliberately scuppered . #% Its by-product , radioactive waste , is already a lethal threat to human health , effectively for ever . #% I think it is good that tonight we are debating in less emotive terms than we would have ten years ago , but I would urge that people look at the science of the debate , rather than the emotion of the past , when they are voting on this very important report . #% However , I would like to mention the fact that the administrative board finds itself overburdened with the administration to the point that it can not concentrate on strategic planning . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I very much appreciate the comments and the content of the Commissioner 's response here this evening . #% Thirdly , and I suppose most importantly , if we find that some data has been misused , what comeback do we have ? #% This is an area of major importance for this Parliament and an area in which we are gaining international respect . #% As some people here have mentioned in relation to the European arrest warrant , there should be pre-conditions attached to that . #% Vessels are to be re-flagged , supposedly with a provision that it does not lead to an increase in the overall capacity of the Latvian fleet . #% However , those countries will have to deal with the consequences of those negotiations . #% My own group , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , is strongly committed to the general concept of developing a capacity for autonomous European action which correctly has been identified as a rapid response capability with the necessary logistical support . #% I call on Commissioner Flynn to begin work now on drafting a new directive to this effect . #% This agreement would be a charter for privatisation , particularly in terms of water , telecommunications and electricity . #% Take the situation in the Irish Sea , where most of the fishermen from my country , Northern Ireland , have to compete to fish . #% Madam President , I would appeal to you to write to all the parties in Northern Ireland , and the Irish and the British governments , to urge them to use every power and every means of persuasion at their disposal to stop these kinds of protests . #% The NII would like to see the minimisation of the amount of high-level liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential hazard . #% As indicated this morning by Dick Spring , the President-in-Office of the Council , maintaining the momentum towards Economic and Monetary Union is one of the main priorities of the Irish presidency . #% I think we will see this week a very clear expression of the will of the European Parliament representing people in every Member State . #% While some political prisoners have been released , 1 000 remain in custody and political leaders continue to be sentenced to brutal prison sentences , some of up to 106 years . #% So , the reality is that good laws that are well drafted , easy to implement , easy to enforce and police , are the key to restoring confidence in the internal market . #% Our decisions were taken here unanimously : support for the International Fund for Ireland , support for the peace and reconciliation programme and , of course , Interreg . #% The incentives given to Xerox in Ireland comply fully with EU competition policy . #% The reasons for this are twofold : the continued dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and his oppression of Iraq 's citizens and the continued imposition of sanctions of the most Draconian kind . #% This ideological debate , however , must not take away from the immediate concern of assisting the Japanese people in every way possible to recover from this disaster . #% The negotiations focus on two central elements . #% What we are trying to do here is improve services for the citizens of Europe so they will understand exactly what has been proposed ; so that consumers will not be frightened that a directive which comes from Europe could privatise or undermine existing services within their country . #% Regions have a right to exploit and protect such specialities for their own economic benefit . #% Under the common fisheries policy , and indeed under other EU policies , there has been a tendency to make policy decisions without full consideration of the valuable views of those working and living in the sector concerned . #% No two situations involving displaced persons are the same . #% In Afghanistan the European Union has a bigger military presence than the United States . #% I am pleased too that you have defined for us ` modalities ' , it is a word strange to the English language , but of course , once you come to rules and numbers you are then beginning to be so clear that certain vested interests begin to take fright , so these negotiations will be difficult . #% The European Union , through the experience of its Member States and experts and by virtue of this proposal , which has been greatly improved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , is rising to the challenge of assisting Member States in public health . #% The golden toad is the most memorable of these species , although probably not the most deserving . #% We are talking about priorities for our cooperation with Latin America , the Middle East , Central Asia , the Far East and South Africa ; our priorities in the fields of human and social development ; sustainable management of natural resources such as water and energy ; the environment and the role of non-State actors . #% This rules out the necessity of putting the designation on the front of the package . #% Can the Commissioner please state what follow-up action has been taken ? #% From an institutional viewpoint , it is important that there is equality for smaller Member States with regard to representation on the European Commission . #% 
Although Mr Juncker , yesterday , sought to make the United Kingdom a scapegoat , the reality is that it is the structures and policies of Europe which are fatally flawed . #% This is a very important initiative and this is an opportune time for it to be brought forward . #% When you look at the situation from that reality , finding a solution or a compromise is not difficult , because despite what some speakers have said , it is not love of one 's country or nationalism that causes war violence ; it is lack of respect , lack of tolerance of differing viewpoints and of diversity within our society . #% Nevertheless , we can not deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late . #% The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins , which will proceed as planned . #% Mr President , I very much agree with the last speaker . #% This region represents one of the most intensively industrialised areas of the world where chemical , radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships . #% Finally , I would just support Mrs Herranz Garcia , who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night . #% If we can control them and use them for our good , it is a great thing ; but by scale and virtue of size it is impossible for a mouse to control what an elephant will do ' . #% The Parliament also has the final say as to whether or not international agreements such as the WTO talks are approved . #% This lack of joined-up thinking between two different sectors or two different parts of the DG in the Commission upsets me , because it is really part of tomorrow 's debate as well and I would just like to make that point very clear . #% This is a clear response to those who argue for an undue focus on short-term cuts to expenditure , which could in fact jeopardise longer-term growth . #% As the tragedy of abduction and murders of innocent young children continues to unfold here in Belgium and elsewhere , there is no-one who can not be other than deeply moved , disturbed and angry at what has been happening . #% That is one area of the fisheries sector where there is the odd reference , here and there , among the plethora of EU legislation , but no Community rules and regulations that specifically cater for the sector . #% A recent study revealed that 40 % of young Irish adults demonstrate permanent and unsightly tooth mottling and staining related to dental fluorosis . #% I would like in conclusion to point out that the Council had already adopted this proposal last Monday . #% I want the timeframe in which complaints are dealt with to be improved as we go forward . #% The huge human , social and economic fall-out from this is incalculable . #% What the Commission is proposing is simply that export refunds would not be paid if the rules on welfare during transport were broken . #% The proposal envisages 2003 as a preparatory year , with some activities beginning to coincide with the academic year 2003-2004 . #% This provides a mechanism for developing closer co-operation in the fields of police and judicial activities in the areas of criminal law . #% The medical histories of those who have died of H5N1 influenza to date are disturbingly similar to accounts of sufferers of the 1918-19 outbreak . #% Could you explain what the situation is ? #% Rural development should stand on its own two feet . #% One of the important aspects of this legislation is after-care . #% However , we need to take initiatives both nationally and at European level to counteract the inevitable negative impacts on these reforms . #% Commission directorates must not shy away from a critical appraisal of their own policies and programmes , because only then can we get the right policies and programmes to secure the confidence of our citizens in the long term and after the reform of the funds in 1999 . #% Mr President , this issue demonstrates beautifully the need for something like the European Union . #% Priorities must be in the best interests of our constituents and aimed at making their lives easier . #% As far as the Euratom section of the Sixth Framework Programme is concerned , I have very grave doubts as to whether the ITER project will be implemented and my personal view - this is not the view of the rapporteur - is that extra funding is not therefore needed . #% Madam President , I would like to speak in favour of Enrique Barón Crespo 's proposal for the reasons he has outlined so eloquently . #% One of the things that I miss from the information we were given is the cost of this operation or what the cost would be if every Member State involved themselves in it . #% Considering the size of the other fleets in the world , there is not a great deal of room in other areas to which these vessels can go without causing problems . #% But be warned , Parliament will not accept any old outcome . #% As it states in the Convention , `` the family as the fundamental group of society and natural environment for the growth and wellbeing of its members , particularly children , should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance to fully assume its responsibility within the Community '' . #% Mr President , I asked to make this brief intervention following the observation of Mr Corbett . #% For my part I believe that Ireland would be very reluctant to become part of a defence alliance still committed in certain circumstances to the use of nuclear weapons . #% This Parliament must actively oppose the ` race to the bottom ' approach to employment and working conditions which is now rife within the European Union . #% Secondly , does he believe that the Portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout Europe when that decision was taken ? #% We must continue to work towards this goal by amending FP7 . #% Mr President , as others have done , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced . #% In relation to the levy to be deducted from processors , could the Commission say whether , if a country -- and I am speaking of Ireland -- grows beet in 2006 , the company has to contribute to the restructuring levy this year , should it intend to stop production in 2007 ? #% I also agree with Mr Clegg that accession countries should be looked at . #% The percentage of women elected to the European Parliament ranges from 58 % to 0 % , with an average slightly above 30 % . #% I should like to put on record that it was considered , but without much debate at all , and the Members of the Legal Affairs Committee were never even advised that Parliament 's legal opinion to the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety was that the dual legal base would not withstand a challenge before the ECJ . #% . Mr President , I agree with the Commissioner 's statement . #% I am also very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for its efficient handling of the budgetary question , which has enabled us to vote today . #% Austria , for example , was sanctioned by the European Union although it did not actually breach human rights : in fact a political party was elected with which most of us could not agree . #% A government has been formed and the transfer of powers and devolution is only hours away . #% Mr President , normally a scientific and technological cooperation agreement is straightforward , very welcome and an occasion for optimism , especially if it is the successor to earlier agreements on which good scientific work has been done . #% The report covers all aspects of the CFP , including conservation and management of resources , structural policy , external fisheries policy , market policy and monitoring and control . #% What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector , and what is the Commission 's strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues , to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well-performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector ? #% There are a lot of good ideas in this report . #% Where I come from in Northern Ireland fishermen have already suffered severe setbacks and quotas and have cooperated in six-week closures during the spawning season , for the last three to four years . #% Mr President , on the issue of substance in that vote , I want to say on behalf of the Liberal Group how disappointed we are that we did not leave in the hands of Parliament the capacity to deliver by a large majority what Parliament actually believes in . #% That is not to say that it is not a factor . #% A different product or therapy incorporating or using knowledge of the same gene sequence should be covered by an entirely separate patent and there should be no derivative patenting . ' #% You have established , Taoiseach , beyond doubt - and in Ireland 's case , not for the first time - the capacity of smaller Member States to discharge their responsibilities to good effect , confounding many of those critics at Member State level who argue trenchantly for change . #% Water is a scarce and precious natural resource . #% Without a clear and mutually accepted definition of terrorism , states must be able to take whatever measures they deem appropriate to deal with these serious threats . #% We have not reached any conclusions yet , but one thing we have established is that the regulators were playing games of ping-pong with policyholders . #% What resources will be made available for widespread public consultations on key ethical issues ? #% For many years , social partners have been viewing social funding , human resources and even goodwill as a cake for which they , like hungry children , have felt compelled to compete . #% In the end it was after 7:00 p.m. before Question Time started . #% On the one hand we have a political and , indeed , a moral obligation to honour the Treaty by admitting new members in accordance with it . #% I believe that we in this House should commend the ILO for its excellent work . #% 
Could I also ask , Madam President ... #% While it is desirable to create a level playing field it may also be necessary to provide subsidies for certain types of energy in order to promote other objectives . #% FIFA , the world 's governing body for football , has said that there has been a recent upsurge in discriminatory behaviour towards fans and black players , an escalation that has dovetailed with the signing by many European clubs of players from Africa and Latin America . #% The government has responded positively to Commission comments with regard to nitrates in groundwater and has in fact established that phosphorous represents a greater threat . #% In this regard the bio-industry has itself contributed in no small way to public unease by the planned introduction of unacceptable practices such as seed-terminator technology and other ethical issues such as experimentation with human embryos . #% The new Israeli Prime Minister , Mr Barak , has put in place a government with a sufficiently strong majority to allow him to resume negotiations in the peace process with adequate parliamentary support for his declared intention to get the peace process moving forward again . #% PROGRESS will hopefully take the competition out of the allocation of funding and other resources to social partners representing people who , because of their situation in life -- physical , mental , social , ethnic , economic , employment or lack of employment , and so on -- need the support of the wider community . #% In today 's world we have too much indifference towards the plight of those who are most in need of our support - not our sympathy , not our charity , not our patronising - to allow them to live full and independent lives and to be treated as equals in the 21st Century . #% Neither does it argue for the patenting of software , nor for extending the patentability and scope of protection in this area . #% The directive should take a clear stand and insist that the use of these marker genes is stopped now . #% It is a very simplistic response which amounts to little more than punishing the powerless for the seeming sins of the powerful . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate the rapporteur on this report and indeed congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her very excellent work in this area of social policy . #% The title of this programme is self-explanatory . #% I believe that the same risk exists today . #% That is a depressing answer , Commissioner , so I hope very much that , in the provision of services directive you are proposing , you will recognise that this is an important issue , and above all that in these situations we are very often discussing a deeply human tragedy . #% Of course , I am impressed by the quality of the legislation and by the fact that this is the way to solve problems internationally , that everybody sits down and makes agreements . #% The European Union should engage in the reconstruction of Iraq and in a situation where the United Nations is at the centre of this effort . #% It is simply not realistic to ask the Commission to monitor every individual payment to final beneficiaries . #% Here we have a different situation . #% How long is that going to take to rectify ? #% Last year 9 500 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the region alone . #% If we go with the scientific argument , let us have some scientific rigour and be consistent and fair all round . #% Those who are more at home with the cosy familiarity of their own tribe , on both sides , must choose a more open and pluralist alternative . #% For us and for Europe the centre must hold , because the very future of the European Union depends on our efforts to involve our citizens and to communicate our positive vision for Europe . #% These are issues which we need to address . #% We have an obligation to examine the record in human rights of the people we do business with . #% Without people , we have very little else . #% The age profile of farmers is deteriorating and young people no longer see farming as a sustainable career . #% Support for coalfield communities , learning projects are an essential component of achieving economic and social cohesion . #% Have they actually done so ? #% That does not mean that the women become the primary carers and the rest of the activities in those units is carried out by the men . #% Indeed I think other Members of this House , if there were any here , might want to know whether there is a fundamental cultural problem with the UK Government 's attitude to structural funds and regional policy ? #% At the same time the European Union , in pursuit of its policies which were forced on us by the clearance group and the United States , has reduced its share of world markets in the dairy sector , in the cereal sector and in the meat sector . #% Industry has given the Member States , the Commission and Parliament a very clear message : it wants consistent judgments under Community jurisdiction and a common jurisprudence , in particular regarding enforcement . #% We unfortunately count for virtually nothing there , because we have not put the structures in place in that part of the world to maximize our contribution to the area . #% On the question of China , it is neither wise nor indeed feasible to believe that we can ignore or isolate China . #% To help those in need when it is in our hands to do so , at the end of the day , results in our really helping ourselves . #% I understand that the Australian Government has been informed of this particular shipment . #% The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries . #% Amendment No 65 is necessary , as it ties this principle , which was endorsed by the Committee on the Environment 's Amendment No 10 , to the passport decision 2000/68/EEC , which amends Decision 93/623/EEC . #% Unfortunately this does not appear to be the case in Ireland regarding paid maternity leave , facilities for breastfeeding and exemption from night shifts . #% What is the dissemination for the new ideas , the new products , the new comparisons of socio-economic systems ? #% Coming from an Objective 1 region in the west of Ireland , I believe that we should have the benefit of hearing what the President-in-Office has in mind regarding future plans for this very important area , particularly since a transition period is required for Objective 1 regions , which would utilise all the benefits that have come from the funds that have been received . #% First , it does not seem to have as great or as damaging an impact on wild birds as it does on domesticated or commercial flocks . #% However , what we are specifically dealing with here is the refusal of the Commission to deal properly and in accordance with the Treaties in replying to questions from this House . #% It is too early for some stocks and is too late for others in the context of overfishing . #% It is not acceptable that we should move by stealth to denying citizens their rights as citizens , which citizenship grants them in Europe , by making competition the only measure of service provision . #% On the question of defence , we warmly welcome the establishment of the rapid reaction force and its significant and necessary progress - Kosovo has taught us dearly the need for that . #% Following on from the President-in-Office 's two responses to my colleagues , Mr Hyland and Mr David Martin , I would like to ask whether you have any proposals with regard to more focused coordination between the regional funds and the rural development funds as a way of ensuring that people in rural areas who suffer because of a drop in income can gain off-farm income through job creation and so on ? #% It is about time the doors of Bilderberg were opened and the public really knew what goes on , because most of the major players in the world today are all playing a part in Bilderberg . #% I read recently in the Financial Times that half the disputes which customers have with the Visa credit card company relate to Internet transactions . #% It contains an answer setting out the British Government 's position in response to the proposition that there should be meetings of the Council held in public . #% Mr President , on a point of order , may I just point out that the interpretation was slightly behind you with regard to taking that vote . #% What we are talking about here is that the Internet would be forced to put facilities in place so that the police can come in through the back door . #% Consumer confidence in beef has been severely undermined and consumption levels have declined by anything up to 30 % . #% EU leaders had extended an invitation to you , Madam President , to attend the meeting : a recognition of the importance of the European Parliament as an institution . #% On 1 May 2004 we will be living in a Community of up to 25 Member States . #% I would like Mary Robinson , the UN Commissioner on Human Rights , to put pressure on the United States to abolish the death penalty . #% Remember that when we hold a referendum on this in the near future , the issues we will be asked to decide on will be of far greater complexity and importance than those related to Nice . #% Clearly the British Government is using Ireland as a scapegoat for its failure to address the genuine problems of its own farmers . #% I think that is what Europe needs today : a greater understanding that there is a return on the investment made in terms of time and effort . #% We are told we should be afraid of the danger lurking behind us , and that things are happening that we do not know about , when the reality is that every single decision taken is accountable . #% They document a massive loss of species , both plant and animal , as a result of climate change . #% The reason I am raising the matter here , by way of question , is because the content of my question was not dealt with in your statement yesterday . #% Mr President , the restoration of consumer confidence in beef is central to this particular issue . #% Of course there are , just like in every other sector -- economic or otherwise -- known to man . #% 
Parliament needs to be actively involved in drafting this report in future years and not merely presented with the finished article before it is published . #% I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and for the information . #% To put it quite simply , I would suggest that it is better to be safe in the short term than sorry in the long term . #% It included clauses on the acquired rights , the so-called ` grandfather clause ' . #% Savings can , and should , be made by limiting the expenses and wages of MEPs , for instance by linking the daily allowance to vouched-for expenses . #% One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties . #% Greater effort must be made by the European Commission , Parliament and the Council to implement European Union directives and regulations in as streamlined a manner as possible . #% And why do I insist on that ? #% It is extremely disappointing that a country like Nigeria , which is the eighth-largest producer of oil in the world , has such a large proportion of the population living below the poverty line . #% The reality is that if any of us here won our national lotteries the likelihood is that we would invest it in property or something of that kind which we would get a return on and which would not require us to take on the difficulties of employment . #% The Yemeni Government is listening to us and is taking note of what Parliament says . #% Mr President , I welcome the strategic guidelines on cohesion and the three priority areas identified . #% First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy . #% I commend the Commission for taking this initiative under Article 152 . #% I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging . #% on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , on 8 January 2009 , the mid-west of Ireland , and especially Limerick , Tipperary and North Kerry , experienced an economic trauma they had never seen before . #% I share the Council ' s view that flexibility in this sector is absolutely essential . #% He emphasises the cost of the common agricultural policy . #% I also believe that the EU must implement the recommendations of the European Employment Task Force . #% One has to ask , therefore , why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it . #% At a national level within Ireland , the post office network is under threat , particularly the smaller rural post offices that are not computerised and can not , therefore , offer an adequate level of service to citizens . #% I can not deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts . #% I wish to report to this House that last week four hundred workers who took part in a legally called strike were summarily dismissed by that company . #% The Integrated Programme is unfortunately , however , not open to all countries in the Union 's neighbourhood . #% I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission , but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life -- on which we all agree -- if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride ? #% Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year , it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have poured into the black hole of Europe . #% Tax incentives must be used to encourage the early introduction of vehicles containing advanced anti-pollution equipment . #% Twenty Member States of the EU have coastlines . #% Madam President , I welcome this joint resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal Kurami . #% They need to give us assurances that it is in the best interests of the children to stay in Romania and indeed we need to know that they are in appropriate homes as we speak . #% Secondly , with regard to the question of utilizing structural funds in the way that has been suggested , yesterday we had the Commission reporting on the abolition of duty-free , saying that it would allow for state subsidy for certain regional transport sectors to ensure that they were not at a disadvantage . #% The adoption , ratification and implementation of the ILO convention can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor and improve the position of the large number of women on the labour market . #% We have had many false dawns in the past regarding the permanent political solution in Northern Ireland . #% In February 2001 when this Parliament discussed cod stock recovery measures , the Nicholson report clearly stated and I quote : ' ? the Commission 's current proposal for a further closure in 2001 can only be accepted with the greatest reluctance ? #% He acknowledged that the meetings with Mr Solana were helpful , but urged more meetings , more discussions and more debate because of the very difficult and strange times which exist at present . #% We should eventually take this approach to everything . #% This body , for example , alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , is already doing good work . #% I also welcome compromises around the issue of audit partner rotation and the issue of non-audit work . #% For the court to say that golf clubs are getting the single farm payment is erroneous . #% I know that he has consulted widely with the political groups in order to make his report as reflective as possible of the various concerns and opinions . #% Mr President , as a member of the Committee of Inquiry I voted for and I fully support the Committee of Inquiry 's findings and recommendations . #% The next logical step , also in harmony with the Charter of Fundamental Rights , is the accession of the EU institutions to the European Social Charter . #% Under Basel II it would become essential that risks analytics are timely assigned to financial services operations . #% What is the money we create for ? #% We are here as representatives of states , all of which have failed to implement a directive that they freely entered into not more than two years ago . #% Whereas some of these areas certainly are under the British Crown , there is no doubt whatever that , for example , the Isle of Man is the most Irish of locations . #% I would ask him to withdraw them straight away ! #% This issue is about implementation or delegated acts . #% Mr President , the Group has not tabled an amendment to ban doorstep selling , but rather to make it subject to conditions in terms of unsolicited negotiation of credit or doorstep selling . #% However , if the Commissioner needs to find leverage to shift the US position , I suggest that he works to get GM crops categorised separately from their natural equivalents . #% Our Amendments Nos 4 , 11 and 12 restate the ethics amendment in full . #% To Mr Ahern I say : now it is time to come home . #% Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado for his hard work but also for his astuteness in picking a subject of paramount importance and for approaching his work in a spirit of scientific and technological inquiry . #% That is my approach in the report , which the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Food Safety strongly supported . #% Firstly , it should be stressed that the Patents Directive is not proposing the introduction of a new patents system into the EU , but instead harmonising and bringing consistency to patent offices throughout different Member States . #% Father Cullen was engaged in a peaceful protest when he was violently arrested , kicked and handcuffed by the police . #% Health and education programmes must be targeted at the African continent where the AIDS plague is out of control . #% This plunder must stop . #% On the Israeli side there has been a failure to meet commitments , to dismantle settlement outposts and to freeze settlement activity . #% I would hope that , after this debate , the House will give it its full support . #% I strongly welcome the initiative taken by my government which has commissioned a study into the possible use of new and alternative forms of waste generation and disposal . #% It will not survive as an industry unless the public believe in a strongly instilled and strictly enforced safety culture . #% That is what is behind Amendment 21 and why I emphasise to the Commission that the tragedy of injury is so much more than the economic burden . #% Mr President , Commissioner , at the outset I want to acknowledge the assistance which I received from the secretariat of the Committee on Fisheries and indeed from the secretariat of my own group in preparing this report . #% If you look in the back of women 's magazines you can see a huge number of adverts encouraging women to put extra things into some parts of their bodies , and to remove parts elsewhere . #% In any event , the basic structures of the Union , which existed at the time individual countries joined the Union and which enjoyed the support of the majority of our electorate at that time , should be preserved as far as possible . #% 
The result of this European Directive , implemented by the Member States , is a total disparity among the Member States . #% There were occasions in the past when farmers were found to be in breach of food regulations and deservedly condemned . #% It is hypocrisy that Colombia gets trade advantages for workers ' rights when it has the world 's highest rate of murders of trade unionists and that EU officials in Zimbabwe are ignorant of key EU human rights guidelines . #% I have a very simple question for the Commission and I should like to have a reply tonight . #% First of all , it streamlines the policy , making it simpler and much more defensible within the GATT negotiations , thereby providing longer-term security for farmers engaged in sheep and goat farming . #% But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large . #% Only last week Parliament 's Committee on Fisheries passed an amendment stating clearly that fish balances shall not be disturbed in western waters and therefore it is in this context that relative stability must be understood . #% I would like to highlight the fact that I voted against Paragraph 4 ( d ) which calls for `` The removal of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure '' . #% Mr President , I should like to start by complimenting Mr Bowe on his objective and balanced presentation . #% To guarantee the allocation for the peace process in Northern Ireland , the Council must now facilitate this accumulation of reserves between the first and second readings . #% How can people across Europe be asked to take a single market seriously if the Commission washes its hands in this way ? #% Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that ? #% This is a domain of severe under-achievement in the European Union . #% What we need to do - and I think this has started to happen since my report during the last Parliamentary term - is to put agriculture and food centre stage . #% You will recall that the first mediator on abducted children was appointed in response to the Algerian mothers ' campaigns in Belgium and France . #% In the sixteenth century the British went to war with the Hanseatic League over Icelandic cod and they only withdrew from that war after some casualties because they discovered a new source of cod off the coast of America . #% I really think it is very tokenistic to ask for some aid programmes for the area . #% Its task is made infinitely more difficult when its main spokesman at the Convention on Europe , former Commissioner Ray MacSharry , has disappointingly made it absolutely clear that his government has drawn a line in the sand in relation to future European integration . #% But I would also say that I very much appreciate that when Mr Tung came to visit the European Union , his first stop was the European Parliament . #% My colleague Mr Stevenson has been complaining bitterly about the fact that we are dealing with something that is already in effect . #% Is the Commission not , in fact , permitted and indeed obliged to make a submission to the European Court of Justice with regard to its view on the issues at stake in that case ? #% author . - I want to congratulate the Commissioner on progress achieved . #% Mass struggle is needed , in particular , the creation of independent , democratic mass organisations of the working class . #% Naturally there is a need to reassure customers by providing adequate protection from real and proven risks and by keeping them informed . #% But you will not resolve the problems of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe by simply turning a blind eye and pretending they do not exist , nor by allowing President Mugabe to leave the country and attend conferences . #% We often see change as something that is always desirable but that can wait until tomorrow . #% In fact -- not in Auschwitz but in other concentration camps -- the ovens were made originally to eliminate disabled people . #% I heard talk here today of how wrong it was of President Barroso to mention that the Commission was going to drop ` x ' number of directives , or that it was going to reduce the number of directives in force . #% The Security Council must send a clear message to all parties involved to ensure that they adhere to agreements already entered into and that they end the violence now . #% We have failed miserably in the European Union to put in place a proper legal framework to allow that money to be utilised alongside the public funding that is available . #% A significant part of domestic work is undeclared , precarious and underpaid , and domestic workers , mostly women , are vulnerable to abuse , especially when working abroad . #% Mr President , this directive underlines the seriousness of our intent to come to terms with greenhouse gases . #% In the EU , we know how much more we can achieve by pooling our resources and setting common standards and by tackling together environmental problems which have cross-border implications . #% First , can we have an assurance that when there is any further disruption to the single market , the Commission will act urgently and swiftly to ensure that Member States discharge their obligations to ensure that the single market is not disrupted . #% My last point is that we need to continue investing in people , because no matter how many figures and statistics are put before us the bottom line is that we are talking about one single individual person who has lost out on an opportunity within the European Union . #% We are also considerably advanced in relation to the most modern technology in identifying all our other animals . #% However , the question was : What contribution the President-in-Office thought that we in the EU and he could make with regard to this global transportation safety question ? #% I am not in favour of people like Alex Falconer jumping up and down every time there is a roll-call vote . #% It is my hope that we can avoid acrimonious debate and respect the right of Members to express freely their views on a subject that is complex , sensitive and , for many , a matter of conscience . #% The Declaration was made at the last minute and can not be considered a positive step in the process of adoption of Community legislation . #% By bringing forward a new draft directive greater pressure would be brought to bear on Member States and people in this House to ensure that what is there already will be implemented . #% In normal circumstances it is only criminals or suspected criminals that are fingerprinted . #% I hope our officials , ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically , because we should not commit ourselves to something we can not deliver . #% I would like some sort of assurance from the Council that this will not actually happen because it is an interference in the democratic process of a Member State . #% There is nothing unusual about parliamentarians visiting this prisoner . #% While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States , I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs , which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union . #% However , I decided to abstain from the vote because the proposed Council directive does not take into account the dangerous effects of shipments and reprocessing of radioactive waste on nuclear-free Member States like Ireland . #% I say ` excessive ' caution . #% I call on the Americans and on the Texas authorities to commute her sentence and to put a stay on her execution . #% Harmonisation of detergents legislation across the Community in this regulation will ensure a level playing field and is in line with the Lisbon proposals . #% During the course of the debate leading up to the referendum vote together with my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil political party , I will be campaigning enthusiastically for a strong ` yes ' vote . #% The codecision procedure covers a wide range of activities including those in the transport sector , regional affairs , social matters , employment initiatives , structural funding , consumer protection , public health and environmental concerns . #% The evidence is extremely shaky in this area . #% This initiative contains several suggestions to the Commission that would help deal with the problems that countries throughout Europe will face in the coming decades . #% At a time when there are many questions with regard to what Europe is doing and what it is about , the one area where we can claim to have success and where we have responded to the concerns of European citizens is in the area of public health . #% Has the Austrian presidency made any efforts to make proposals in relation to transfrontier contamination or emissions or accidents from radiation ? #% Yet , even when we take in people from outside , we see in our accident and emergency departments , on a daily basis , people who in many respects are in Third World conditions , lying on trolleys in unacceptable conditions . #% As consumption falls sharply and other countries rely on their own production without importing , the collapse of the Russian economy has further weakened a fragile market . #% While accepting in principle the proposal of a European company operating according to the same principles EU-wide , the scope of this proposal should not extend to restricting national taxation decisions , which remain firmly the preserve of individual Member States . #% The groundwork has been done and I commend you , Mr President , for your leadership and enthusiasm for the European project and also the Commission and the Danish presidency for their efficiency in dealing with this unprecedented project . #% On the issue of the race to the bottom , I should like to ask you to comment on the statement by the Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , when he said that when enlargement happens in January , Ireland may not open the market to workers from Romania and Bulgaria , because other Member States are not so doing and because of the concerns as to what will happen to the Irish market in relation to this race to the bottom and the rights of workers . #% There are a limited number of services -- especially health services -- that should have sector-specific measures . #% If they are representing the Commission , we need to know what happens at these Bilderberg meetings because at the end of the day this is a secret organisation which is deciding global policy without any input from the public . #% Yet EU farmers are expected to compete with imports from countries where those products are used . #% It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens . #% I give my support to the report in general and I am delighted with the comments it makes . #% 
What will be the long-term consequences of that ? #% As a result , as every speaker so far has said , certain committees raised questions on the suitability , or otherwise , of individuals . #% When they have a complaint to make , they will reach for the nearest known vehicle available to them . #% But , within that limit of 1.27 % it is very difficult to see adequate resources being provided to ensure that this enlargement will satisfy the applicants and their citizens . #% Sub-prime lending - that is lending to poorer people , those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans - is projected to grow to EUR 4 billion in Ireland this year . #% I share the concerns of colleagues . #% Mr President , the College of Quaestors seeks to be neutral in terms of expressing political opinions and I can assure you that it will continue to be so . #% Far too often their contribution to society has been taken for granted and certainly not always adequately rewarded with a reasonable income . #% But I wish to state that it is very unwise to selectively highlight any one issue which is already covered quite comprehensively in the agreement . #% We need simple , better-focused legislation which is easier to enforce . #% Mr President , as other colleagues have done this week , I too would like to draw the attention of the House to the unusual fact that we were not allowed to make one-minute speeches on Monday . #% They work on the basis of differing protection standards and outside true democratic and legal scrutiny . #% We are looking for a greater role as a parliament in ensuring that we can conclude agreements with regard to social inclusion , so as to best respond to the needs and demands of those people we represent . #% Instead we have seen bitter and tragic civil war between warring factions , Islamic militia and factions controlled by rival war lords . #% However , if we discover that banks have failed to comply with their obligations regarding similar or equal charges both domestic and abroad , and if we find that there are usury rates being added by banks with regard to operation of a card from one Member State to another , what action can be taken by an individual consumer , without going through the whole rigmarole of making an official complaint to the Commission ? #% Commissioner , is it not a fact that the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda are far from being attained , and that we are still lagging behind in measures necessary for the coordination and progress of SMEs under those objectives of the Lisbon Agenda that we initially laid down ? #% So , I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya . #% Personally , I am getting increasingly fed up with so-called analyses in newspapers and commentaries on issues of personality which miss the points of substance . #% It is right for us to encourage competition but the timing , elements and basics have to be right . #% A study by the Lough Corrib Angling Federation found that the Irish state agencies were involved in little more than a policy of supervised neglect of western lakes . #% My group 's essential and fundamental starting point in this debate is very clear . #% In this context , I welcome the importance the rapporteur has given to culture in peaceful conflict resolution . #% On this area I think it is worth pointing out that the excise tax on mineral oils is tried and tested in all of our fiscal regimes . #% It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes , but also future generations . #% It is a fact that today , our farmers are faced with overwhelming obstacles when it comes to achieving a fair price for their produce . #% My second question relates to a comment the Commissioner made earlier in the debate when she said that the 10 % which is being set aside under the restructuring scheme for growers could be increased by Member States in particular circumstances . #% He replied that he could not discuss that because he was not yet the President and he did not know who the other nominees were going to be . #% In fact , the contrary is the clear message . #% I have to say also that given that the DCI was only approved last December and it is very much a new process for all of us , Parliament has hit the boards running . #% We should be able to sit down and make progress in these areas . #% None of it worked , because the latest International Monitoring Committee report shows that we still have a functioning , recruiting , training , threatening and active IRA that works hand-in-glove with its junior partner , Sinn Féin , whose members , as ever , are notably absent when we debate terrorism in this House . #% This funding for population and reproductive health care will be accessed to provide abortion in developing countries , according to the upcoming Sandbæk report . #% Small and mediumsized enterprises must be able to reap the benefits from the new climate created by the single currency in the immediate future and they must be helped to do so by national governments and state agencies . #% Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done . #% I want to congratulate my colleague , Mr Hyland , for the work he has put into this report and to say to him that I strongly support it . #% They are looking for exactly the same conditions as those regions that left Objective 1 in 2000 . #% Given the situation , are n't we lucky to have Mr Diamandouros ! #% ' I was involved in a traffic accident in May 1988 . #% It has to stop . #% They use cross-subsidy to the tune of 31.8 billion of public money - and rising fast - compared to our EUR 6 billion - and falling . #% Perhaps their difficulties serve the hidden agenda of some who do not have to courage to say openly that family farms do not have a future in the Europe of a new millennium . #% This is unfortunate - plus the fact that the Rules of Procedure have left it impossible for us to submit this amendment again , which means that we can not get a registered roll-call vote on the fact that Members are failing to adhere to the whole issue of transparency . #% It is crucial that a distinction should be made between commercial services and public services , and that public services such as water , sanitation and energy should not be dismantled or undermined in the GATS . #% My group would insist in the post-Laeken period on some convention-style method with deep involvement for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to include the active engagement of Council . #% Their own government has crucified them by refusing to allow them into the single currency . #% Does the President-in-Office of the Council understand that the ending of duty-free contrary to the majority view of the Member States has undermined the strategy of airports , airlines and passenger shipping companies aimed at keeping fares at a low level ? #% That is the essence of the way democratic control should work in the area of liberty and security . #% So they face the dual interest which you have delineated . #% Finally , I was rather appalled last week at the personalized attack made on our friends Mr Tomlinson , Mr Wynn , the Court of Auditors , its President and Mr Balfe , who all represent the structures of this Parliament , by an independent television programme and at the fact that the President of this Parliament did not make a statement on it . #% On a global scale , more people -- especially children -- die every day from the effects of malaria than have been killed so far by avian influenza . #% The appropriate political levels are national governments and the eurozone . #% Dependency on any single resource leads to market vulnerability . #% Unfortunately , there are still tens of thousands of children who have AK-47s put into their hands and are sent out to war to kill other people . #% In recent weeks we have heard much talk about a review of the agricultural budget which was agreed in Berlin only a few months ago . #% Parliament 's procedures do not allow it to make rapid decisions , but there are suggestions tabled by MEPs that perhaps the European Council could find helpful . #% The Irish President-in-Office , Gay Mitchell , in response to my suggestion , said that proposals coming from Parliament to this effect would be welcomed by the presidency . #% On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission . #% It is rather disappointing that the Member of the Commission responsible for this issue is not here and that someone else is here who is not responsible for this portfolio . #% Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work on PROGRESS , a new and comprehensive structure for social solidarity . #% Such producers should be rewarded for designing to reduce waste at competitive prices . #% It would appear to put business interests first , which is a very dangerous precedent because environmental and health and food safety requirements should come before any business interests . #% Any future strategy must remain compatible with the existing framework . #% ADR is a valuable way to access justice providing services and remedies which are appropriate to the cost of the item . #% I want to thank the Commissioner for his response . #% But the East Timorese resistance leaders are still in prison . #% We have good postal services accompanied by a quality social service which is of immense value . #% 
There will not be a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Union as a result of the enactment of the provisions of the Treaty . #% European governments and the EU institutions must now focus their attention on promoting health education in schools in the area of making young people aware of the dangers of smoking . #% On behalf of my group , I fully support the provisions of paragraphs 54 and 55 of the motion for resolution which call for a ban on human cloning , regardless of the technique used , and on other activities which are intended to result in the modification of the human gene line . #% Issues such as continuing high levels of unemployment in some of the Member States , tackling poverty , combating discrimination on grounds of disability , promoting active ageing and providing childcare facilities are all important and need to be dealt with as priorities . #% In expressing our displeasure , we have to be careful not to punish any further the suffering people of Belarus . #% However , there was a very good compromise , and I can not understand why Mr Ó Neachtain did not retable just his committee proposals and allow them to go through . #% Ritalin is the most widely prescribed drug for children in the US . #% We had a fundamental reform of the CAP in 1992 . #% I would certainly agree with the idea in principle , but I believe that an overarching directive would cause enormous confusion in the debate , especially in the debate in Member States . #% Indeed a major international crime conference in Dublin this week highlighted the very serious difficulties drug squad officers from European countries have in dealing with the Europol drugs unit in the Hague . #% Rural development in action is much more interesting than the theory behind it . #% I do , however , regret that the Council and the Commission were quite slow in making progress here . #% However , Europe 's framework programme has a reputation for being the most bureaucratic in the world . #% Practically every night television news bulletins bring stories into our homes of more and more horrendous crimes being perpetrated by evil people , often against defenceless people in our society , such as young children or the very old . #% I speak for my own country of Ireland . #% This is our best opportunity to try to find a long-lasting and just peace settlement between the different traditions and the different peoples there . #% I come from Ireland where a recently published report by the Cork University Hospital - one of the two centres designated for treating victims of nuclear and chemical accidents - stated that there are no facilities presently available to enable it to fulfil this role . #% We want to ask you about your willingness , your personal willingness , to accept that you are accountable and responsible to the public of Europe in whatever you do with your President and before this House and in clear and full public understanding that this is the public forum for European democracy to which you are accountable and have a public responsibility . #% When I protested and demanded the release of some CWI colleagues , the police themselves told me that it was preventive arrest , preventive detention . #% Has it not in fact been asked by the Court to make such a submission ? #% It was interesting that the Commission recorded that several countries had failed to meet targets in the statistics on the size and capacity of the national fleets . #% I accept that several entries that are currently in Annex IIa will have to be removed from it in the light of recent jurisprudence . #% Because the siege has still not been lifted and crossings are still closed , it is very difficult to get essentials to the people . #% For months in this House the college of Commissioners has suffered from a self-induced collapse in its credibility . #% They represent policy areas that are at the very heart of the European Union . #% Of these , four have been turned down and 11 have been approved . #% Yet the number of `` no '' votes was smaller than before , not larger , and so in this regard we should retain a sense of proportion . #% I welcome this directive . #% in writing . - The general thrust of this report advocates that rather than import protein from third countries , we should encourage farmers to produce it here in Europe . #% There seems to be a misunderstanding between the British and German authorities . #% I now want to congratulate the Greek authorities on the excellent Olympic Games and to express my disgust at the suggestion of the outgoing President of the Commission that in future games the European Union flag should be flown alongside the national flag . #% We are in the process of ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty which includes a special chapter on unemployment and we are introducing this new coordinated path of having national employment plans submitted to Brussels to be assessed by the Commission and evaluated at the end of the first year . #% I do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of Members who speak on issues in this Parliament . #% This is a challenge to the Council . #% Our citizens have challenged us in the field of food production to safe food , with the guarantee of adequate precautions to ensure this goal and proper liability and penalties in place for any violation resulting in damage to the person on the environment . #% I find it incredible that the EU is not demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Famagusta to its inhabitants who are , incidentally , EU citizens . #% It wastes that brain power because it fails to engage women in the task of science adequately . #% The investigation is focusing in part on the possible payments of secret commissions to intermediaries with a view to securing contracts . #% The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead . #% The European Union must act to ensure that there are no safe havens in Europe for cyber paedophiles . #% It is being recast in order to simplify it and to make it easier for producers to tell which substances are banned , so as to avoid any unnecessary mix-ups that could be dangerous to the consumer and waste companies ' resources . #% The European Commission has also presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet , in line with the provisions of the Council 's European cyber-crime convention . #% I welcome the proposal for four representatives on the board to be appointed by Parliament . #% By action I do not mean offensive action by the military , but with the strongest weapon we have , which is moral persuasion and the economic support that we give to those areas . #% The European Union was , in fact , very well placed . #% I also want to say that George Orwell would find it difficult to create characters like Rumsfeld , Cheney and Ashcroft . #% I wish Sri Lanka well and I would urge all the political leaders on the island and its citizens to support this peace process and cherish the hope that it will bring permanent peace to their country . #% Unfortunately , today 's choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain . #% And when do we amend legislation in this Parliament ? #% That is the type of breakdown we need in every area of injury if we are going to save lives . #% The future financing of EU enlargement was a centre-stage issue at the Brussels Summit . #% The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented , since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the so-called adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds , mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process . #% The purpose of the exercise , as recorded in the Minutes , was to bring to the attention of the British and German Members the iniquity of her detention . #% The Irish Government is monitoring , and will continue to monitor , all aspects of Ireland 's position in relation to eligibility for structural funds especially as a consequence of an increase in Ireland 's GDP per capita as a percentage of the European Union average . #% Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , it is with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to the Swedish presidency on the tremendous successes it has achieved on behalf of us all . #% Already there is some evidence that this is happening . #% That is the law in my Member State and in the UK and we wish to continue that practice . #% But , if for no other reason than economic growth and a viable future for Europe , we should rethink our attitude to the sanctity of life , to the position of the family and to support for mothers and other carers . #% In conclusion , I fully support those who say that there should be no co-financing of the common agricultural policy . #% It is ridiculous . #% Without a doubt the Novo report is exceptionally important . #% But to fail to provide information requested by the Commission under Article 10 of the Treaty in a timely and proper manner is inexcusable . #% Doubtless all our thoughts are with her family at this very difficult time . #% How can you , from up there , see exactly which people are Members and which are staff and what the actual figures are ? #% Madam President , I welcome this report by my colleague Mr Chichester . #% Is the Commissioner aware that the vehicle registration tax in Ireland will add anything between 50 % and 100 % to the price of cars ? #% 
It should try to pull the Member States along , because the Member States are being dictated to by the industry . #% However , it is clear from his own report that BNFL can not be trusted . #% Mr President , I have noted very carefully what my Irish colleague has said . #% I am particularly pleased that my own country , Ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability . #% He said : ` Council 's judgment was ' , and the statement that was issued was ` Council 's judgment ' . #% Such an initiative would , in my view , restore not only consumer confidence in food but also public confidence in the EU itself . #% For the reason that I had tabled the amendment to the motion for a resolution in Mr Fabra Vallés ' report calling for the rotation of all information officer appointments at Grade A level in Parliament 's offices in national capitals , I asked the Secretary-General , the incoming President and the Vice-President to examine the case of rotating the Grade A staff around the cities of Europe on a four-year rotation basis . #% Let us regulate and license research in this most sensitive and important of areas with commensurate penalties for the exceptional rogue who would put self-glory above the common good and the destiny of humankind . #% However , that said , there is an opportunity for greater accountability of Europol . #% However , there are a few things that I want to point out . #% He is then liable to what amounts to a waste tax for merely handling the goods and , in addition , has to waste time and effort on trying to assess the weight of the packaging . #% The long-term objectives of the European Union should be served as best we can by the budget . #% We are using taxpayers ' money to subsidize an inhumane way of treating animals . #% In a question like climate change , the European Union justifies its existence . #% Mr President , first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons . #% The advent of enlargement , however , gives us a fresh opportunity to re-examine this matter . #% We must all ensure that we encourage Hamas to return to ceasefire talks with the Palestinian Prime Minister , Mahmood Abbas . #% Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this . #% Mr President , congratulations are in order today of course to Mrs Read on her excellent report and to Commissioner Liikanen . #% However , our own actions rarely live up to our promises . #% I have taken steps to try to inform myself as to the equivalence that exists among governments and among national parliaments . #% All countries with any involvement in the fishing industry - such as catching the fish , owning or crewing vessels , providing harbours , buying the final product - must participate . #% When put to the test , those who talk the most about human rights and freedom of speech have hypocritically displayed themselves as utterly intolerant in their virulent attacks on Commissioner-designate Buttiglione . #% Mr President , I , like everybody else , or perhaps most other people in this House , want a single market . #% In the past , high profile genocidal outrages like Srebrenica provoked sufficient anger to galvanise the international community into action . #% Immigrants and those we feel uncomfortable with in society are branded , as criminals are today . #% The same applies to Ireland : it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals . #% Also very significant was the appointment of the special envoy to the Great Lakes area . #% In the face of government cuts , the EU is providing vital funds for the UK regions . #% Farmers ' wives know how to use computers and could use them on the farm . #% The Nice result is not an outburst of Euro-scepticism . #% Because when you look at humanity no two human beings are the same . #% Brazilian sugar barons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform , while 4 000 Irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant . #% The common position was developed in tandem with the proposed NEC directive and represents a coherent and balanced approach to achieving environmental objectives over time . #% I am also pleased to see references in this report to trafficking and enforced prostitution , to children who witness violence , and to action specifically designed to prevent newborn children from being abused . #% I am not being nationalistic and saying that I want the Irish Embassy , but there is a certain amount of danger in this , particularly because it is geared towards the common foreign and security policy , which is not in the interest of the developing world or of the peoples that have been persecuted and exploited by Member States of this Union . #% I go back to the example of toys . #% Certain amendments proposed by the ECON committee have called for uniformity in certain areas by 2010 , including tax , effectively restricting the application of national law . #% That part of my question has not been answered . #% In circumstances where fish is scarce and expensive , as it is in the European Union , it is very wasteful to use any fish for industrial purposes if it can be processed for human consumption . #% The ins and outs of food supply and the food supply chain in general is a topic which is relevant to both farmers and consumers alike . #% If I had had the opportunity yesterday to put these questions , I would have done so . #% On top of that we have the question of how our policies of today are going to cope in 10 to 15 years ' time , when this population gets older . #% In Asia many species are unsustainably exploited , either to provide food for the pet trade or because people believe that eating specific animal parts can cure disease or strengthen their sexual capacities . #% I also owe a lot to this Parliament and to Strasbourg in terms of my own thinking . #% Schengen allowed for full implementation in the countries subscribing to the Single Act , especially as regards the free movement of persons . #% It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers , but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future . #% Will the Commission take legal action in these Member States to try to recover the assets looted from that country so that they can be used for the reconstruction of the new Democratic Republic of Congo ? #% Mr President , the murder of Rosemary Nelson sent a shiver through the whole of Ireland . #% Mr President , I speak today on behalf of my group with regard to the proposal put before this House . #% I want to see a situation where criminals , whether they are drug dealers , IRA , bank robbers or white-collar fraudsters find it impossible to launder their ill-gotten gains anywhere in Europe . #% As I have repeatedly said , without the core business of farming most rural development projects can not be successful , because they can not stand alone . #% I would also like to draw the House 's attention to the fact that I asked the Director of the UK Neurofibromatosis Association to provide Members of Parliament with information during the patenting directive debate , and that she was subsequently censured by the Charities Commission for this action . #% It is early days yet for us to have a definitive idea of how this process will develop , but I do believe that you , Madam President , have been excessively cautious and I would like to raise one or two questions with you and invite you to respond to them at the end of the debate . #% However , farm household incomes are becoming increasingly diversified . #% The House can be assured that on every occasion that meetings of this type take place , these issues are raised . #% I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust . #% I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there . #% I am particularly annoyed and vexed by the fact that in the UK it is said that its record employment rates are second to none in the EU . #% He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post . #% in writing . - This report on the Annual Report on Human Rights 2008 evaluates the state of human rights actions around the world and calls for improvements in some key areas . #% Since then there has been a change of government in 1996 and the decision was taken to suspend the application and to look instead for a strengthened association agreement . #% . -- Mr President , there is no doubt that the common fisheries policy and the traditional quota system have resulted in depleted fish stocks . #% For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development . #% Thanks to the European Union , Europe 's past has been put aside in the interests of peace and prosperity for all the peoples of Europe . #% I would ask the President-in-Office if he is willing to have this matter examined , if not by the Council , by the Commission or indeed the European Central Bank . #% 
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report . #% What colleagues have said about skin cancer is absolutely true . #% It is not an issue that we should link with other matters because that merely diverts attention away from where the real work can be done . #% We all know that the market on its own will not deliver social justice for the people of Europe . #% Part of this common position includes a complex derogation in respect of Ireland , Northern Ireland and Greece as well as further considerations for Luxembourg . #% The Hague Convention is a good piece of legislation , though it is not quite good enough . #% From an Irish perspective , I am pleased that this report does not come up with any findings against the Irish Government , and this is in line with assurances given by the US authorities . #% Short-sea shipping carries 41 % of goods traffic within the Community . #% We , as a democratically elected forum , must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country . #% I just wish to point out to the President-in-Office that there is written and video evidence concerning this harassment . #% The NSRAC has provided a bridgehead for bringing fishing interests , biologists and environmentalists together , getting them to agree collectively on ways of conserving stocks of plaice and sole . #% They tell the IRA terrorists in my country that they can hold on to their weapons which have murdered my constituents , both Roman Catholic and Protestant , and be welcomed at the White House and Downing Street . #% If we are truly to bring about the idea of the single market , and if we are truly to live up to the principles of the freedom of movement of persons , than we must dismantle these barriers , which we can see are not so much at a European Union institution level but are actually at Member State level and indeed in some Member States at the level of certain individual professions . #% The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs . #% We have just embarked on follow-up research that looks specifically at flooding . #% If we want the internal market to work we need flanking measures to promote consumer confidence , particularly in cross-border shopping , and we know that in online shopping consumers still have a tendency to buy in their own home market . #% Finally , I totally support paragraphs 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 of the resolution . #% It needs to make its services better known to libraries , to consumer watchdogs and , of course , to my fellow MEPs , as well as to local authorities , which are often in breach of EU law . #% I accept Commissioner Verheugen 's explanation that he was speaking in a German context and in a personal capacity . #% There is the case of two Ukrainian doctors who risked their lives to expose local Ukrainian businesses that market organ tissue from 20-week-old babies , purchased , birthed and kept alive during the painful harvesting process . #% In the committee we are told that it is our job to ` sell the Treaty ' , that we should restrict the debate in our home countries , that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the ` yes ' vote . #% Indeed , Community action which complements national policies shall be directed towards improving public health , preventing human illness and diseases and obviating sources of danger to public health . #% Can we take the moral high ground , when the European Union , in the interests of profit - and profit alone - is selling weapons and instruments around the world with which to inflict punishment and death on people We have to look to ourselves first and see what we are doing to fuel human rights abuses in the world . #% We have quite considerable concern recently expressed in Ireland at the very small number of accessible buses . #% It is regression not progress : that is an issue of substance . #% However , as Alan Kelly has said , it is very important to ensure that any programmes or training courses that are put in place are tailor-made to respond to the needs of workers and that the possibility of re-entering the labour market , or setting up one 's own business , is the clear objective of any assistance . #% Mr Maat was right when he said that the Commission must make a good job of it . #% I fully endorse the proposal that depictions of persons under the age of 18 involved in sexually explicit conduct constitute the sexual exploitation of children . #% Finally , could I gently take issue with Mrs Van Brempt , who has done a lot of work in this area , and point out to her that my gender certainly did not pre-programme my views on this issue . #% As the Commissioner has said , it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3 % to 5 % every year . #% However , these tax penalties will have a negative impact on families . #% Mr President , I also voted against this resolution . #% The answer to difference is to respect it , because it is an accident of birth . #% Mr President , it is absolutely unacceptable that more than 600 people , including children , have been held for two years in Guantanamo Bay without charge or trial , in circumstances which no democratic state could legitimately stand over . #% By insisting on better pay , the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports . #% Now we have an opportunity for LIFE + to become even more valuable , in particular to the smaller and newer Member States , which could receive a more equal spread of budget over the period 2007-2013 of $ 2 billion . #% . I believe that the European parties ' statute , which provides for the financing of European political parties , is in breach of the subsidiarity principle . #% I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response to the question . #% We have to be more vocal in our support for the right of the Palestinian people to have their own state , whilst at the same time guaranteeing the right of Israel to its security . #% I believe the resolution associated with this oral question represents a step back from existing Parliament positions , most recently expressed in the Schroedter report . #% I trust that both my colleagues in this Chamber and those working throughout the European institutions will consider these principles in the years ahead . #% So when we speak about the free movement of workers and when we speak about updating regulations we should be clearer in our focus on two points , namely that , firstly , in Nice the governments decided that this should be done by unanimous voting , not by qualified majority voting , and secondly that there should be no discrimination - either positive or negative - against any worker who is legally resident within the Member States of the European Union . #% I endorse the decision to update the 1984 directive which will protect people from ionizing radiation during medical exposures . #% Mr President , all Members of the European Union can take solace from the fact that the European Union economy is performing well and that we have permanent democratic structures operating in all our respective jurisdictions . #% Mr President , I wish to bring the attention of this Assembly to recent studies on the effects of climate change in particular , which were published in the scientific journal . #% I should like to know what positive or proactive action is being taken by the presidency to ensure that not only the existing Member States within the EU , but also those countries with associate membership numbering 27 in total , which could help bring us up above the 60 countries required for formal ratification and the enforcement of this International Criminal Court , actually ratify . #% Mr President , I listened with great interest to the long and sustained shipping metaphor of the Commissioner , who can now lay claim to be a master mariner of sorts . #% If we are to achieve anything in this , we must be adventurous and innovative ; we must encourage the development of more small and medium-sized enterprises and more micro-industries in rural areas . #% And the same applies elsewhere , particularly in the United Kingdom . #% I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of Socrates places such an emphasis upon promoting knowledge of EU languages . #% I hope that you and your colleagues will be vigilant in ensuring that we have the opportunity to maintain that diversity , as it adds to what essentially the core of Europe is all about . #% Manufacturers must be encouraged to use far less packaging material . #% Israel 's initial response to the reconciliation , withholding Palestinian Authority ( P.A. ) taxes , is illegal and potentially catastrophic for peace , putting at risk the state-building efforts of Prime Minister Salem Fayyad . #% We await the Commission 's review of the operation of the emissions trading regime next June to keep the cynics and the ` I told you so 's ' at bay and to maintain the credibility of the emissions trading scheme . #% in writing . - I voted against this dangerously worded draft directive from the Commission and Council that sought to create a low pay job market for migrant workers in the EU . #% I believe it is actually a waste of taxpayers ' money to challenge it because I think it is quite clear to anybody with an ounce of common sense that they are not entitled to this money . #% Irish defence forces serving overseas require United Nations approval , the agreement of the Irish Government and the approval of the Irish Parliament . #% The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe . #% Deficits must be steadily reduced over the coming years , as the economy recovers from the effects of the financial crisis , but growing our way out of the crisis is the only effective option to secure long-term fiscal sustainability and protect citizens . #% I believe that , if we are to have a real and fruitful discussion about social policy , we have to ask the fundamental questions and the difficult questions relating to EU macroeconomic policy . #% Much of the hope of the impoverished third world - currently the portion of the globe suffering under the heaviest burdens of death and misery from HIV/AIDS , malaria and TB - is vested in our ability to offer funding for research and medicines that are effective , easy to use and affordable . #% I think that this is something we have got to give very serious thought to . #% One of the issues which the honourable Member raises is the question of the Essen strategy which included , incidentally , a report on local initiatives and the contribution they can make . #% Despite some joint scientific work with Palestinians , I have had complaints regarding barriers to some of that work . #% We need to address how we protect the external borders of the European Union . #% This is as it should be and it is good news , but we need vigilance . #% 
In conclusion , I want to take the opportunity to refer to the other group - the junior doctors . #% The TB test we use now is herd-specific , not animal-specific . #% These changes are needed immediately , otherwise there will be a further collapse in the market for beef . #% However , the bulk of the trade is made up of mammals , usually weighing more than one kilogram . #% It is important that the EU embark on the pension reform process so as to be able to cater for pension payments in the future . #% I am afraid I ran out of my office with the wrong file under my arm and had to go back for the correct one . #% If Europe does not supply the live cattle requirements , other countries will ; and surely we must have on our agenda the objective of maximizing the full potential of European agriculture . #% It is not only in our interest in Ireland that we ratify the Nice Treaty , it is in the interests of all the accession states who want to rejoin the European family . #% Perhaps at last , with the adoption of this report , we can deliver a result for two-time petitioner , my constituent Peter Downes , whose son suffered fatal head injuries in a horse riding accident and has campaigned tirelessly ever since for an improvement in safety standards . #% What has been the outcome of Mr Solana 's discussions and what response was received from the Iranians ? #% While this is very welcome , it does not give much detail . #% The difficulties which occurred - a 4 % possible error in the area of agriculture and a little more in the area of Structural Funds - did not result from the failure of the European Commission to dispense those funds in an efficient way , but from a failure - and it was a small failure - to control the Member States and the European governments and to ensure that the Member States and their administrations had done the job in the way it should have been done . #% It must reluctantly be said that the Irish have been less than generous in their acceptance of the population movements affecting them . #% Perhaps I made a mistake in putting this question to the Council rather than the Commission , because there is immense frustration in Ireland , with young people in particular . #% Last week the International Court of Justice found , much to the vindication of Ireland 's position , that nuclear weapons were the ultimate evil . #% I have every confidence in their ability to do so . #% Blackmailing threats of resignation indicate a weakness which is a running sore already and will develop into a festering boil . #% In the broader political field , the European Union and Syria have yet to agree on a new EU-Syria economic association agreement . #% While we recognise that Tunisia faces a certain threat from extremist elements and is trying to deal with that threat , it must do so in a way that respects human rights standards and democratic standards . #% It would be very wrong if we were to suggest that there should be a tax imposed on the farmers exporting from those countries if their governments are forced to submit to a devaluation of their currency . #% Whether this Parliament likes it or not , when laws are violated there is always a sad reaping to the violation of law . #% in writing . - It is extremely important that the EU takes action and becomes a world leader in reducing carbon emissions approaching the Copenhagen Summit . #% This proposal has been discussed at a number of meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues , which is made up of scientific and management experts from Member States . #% That is what the authors of this motion would have us believe . #% Even the notion of citizenship is distinct from being a citizen . #% Areas of special consideration under Natura 2000 fall under the competences of various DGs in the Commission . #% For Irish nationals this is very important , and it is important to realize under this heading that there is no threat here to Irish neutrality . #% An enlarged unreformed community has a permanently increased exposure to disagreements which could stultify progress to our ultimate goal of a United States of Europe . #% I extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur , my colleague , Mr Moreira Da Silva , for the enormous body of work that he did in bringing all of us to where we are today . #% Take Kosovo , Africa and other developments around the world , where the European Union has responded positively to putting peacekeepers and police forces in the field and to promoting other constructive developments on the ground . #% The Commission President and Enrique Barón Crespo have both referred to this question of the interinstitutional dialogue and balance and President Prodi has talked about the very sensitive issue of call-back procedure . #% I appeal to the governments concerned to reassess their position and to remove any obstacles to agreement which reflect a short-term view of the situation . #% Ireland has benefited enormously over the past ten years and we have made very good use of our structural funds . #% That is the issue we hope the Commission will address . #% Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its elegant balance . #% Ministers go on here with very long replies . #% That is why many of the measures in SAVE II are aimed at households - better design of houses , more economical household appliances and effective education programmes . #% In order to ensure maximum development in the ACP regions it is essential to take on board the question of peace and security . #% While I welcome it , I urge the incoming French Presidency to give it the priority it needs . #% Mr President , firstly , I want to draw attention to the absence of a number of issues in the social policy area . #% Those who talk about broader political integration within the Union take for granted that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a done deal . #% Since it was first recorded in 1997 , avian flu strain H5N1 has undergone multiple reassortments -- more than 17 mutations -- and evolved at high speed to the point where , in January 2003 , the ` z ' virus emerged . #% We would like the Council to assist us with the earliest possible time but if they fail to approve the Commission by 5 May , then at least we should have as a fallback that we can approve the Commission within the life of the Parliament . #% The European Peace Fund 2000-2004 supported 4 000 projects in Northern Ireland and the border county region alone . #% This must be our resolve . #% The Commissioner will be interested to know that I had the honour of chairing a meeting last week on the issue of child pornography , organised by the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children . #% I will finish by re-echoing what has already been said on border controls : border controls are totally inefficient . #% Nowhere was this more apparent than during the Bosnian crisis when there was significant disunity among Member States . #% Already in Northern Ireland , a product - Soltron - is in use which has had immediate results in combating poisons emitted . #% The British Government is continuing to hide the truth of Mr Finucane 's murder for its own political reasons . #% I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to his response . #% I feel we can not welcome an Australian proposal which is no longer an Australian proposal on this particular issue . #% The aspect of employment in all sectors of the fishing industry needs to be reviewed . #% Mr Diamandouros has engaged in an astonishing level of activity , not only in dealing with the thousands of complaints he has received , but in preparing his office for enlargement and in visiting almost all of the Member States , including all ten new Member States . #% In these circumstances , using minorities , including gay people , as scapegoats is a standard , cynical way to divert attention from the failures of the establishment . #% I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort , which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us . #% I also welcome the presentation on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which took a balanced approach to the major and indeed legitimate concerns of the Committee on Budgetary Control about fraud . #% This is very important in light of the key social and economic role the vintage car sector plays in promoting tourism across the length and breadth of Europe . #% It may be my last opportunity to do so publicly . #% We are always an action plan away from action . #% While Member States control key instruments such as national budgets , pension and healthcare services , the EU can further the reach of anti-discrimination legislation , particularly to protect older women in the labour market . #% It is essential that the voters in the Member States know how serious the Members of this House are about protecting the health of European Union citizens . #% An FTT could help reduce volatile and risky financial trading while raising billions to help tackle the effects of climate change and help developing countries who have been hit hardest by the financial crisis . #% While some people may say that it is not the right approach , it is the only way we are going to get any sort of progress for women . #% We will continue to urge early progress in introducing and implementing the further reforms necessary adequately to safeguard human rights which do not meet the standards we expect . #% I wish to congratulate her on her report . #% 
As Mrs Isler Béguin said , can we see the same level of subsidies - look at the money spent on research in fusion - in renewable energies ? #% I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme . #% There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying various forms of dangerous cargoes . #% Mr President , Africa has featured a lot today in the debate , and rightly so . #% Indeed I will go further and call for the exclusion of those workers who are involved in the processing of fresh fish - and I emphasise fresh fish - because there is no continuity of supply when we are dealing with fish . #% That council has been suspected of being involved in dumping in some of these illegal sites and the EPA , the body responsible for protecting the environment , has actually granted a waste licence to one of these illegal sites . #% We have avoided putting a figure on those resources , but the Commission should commit a specific amount of resources to ensure that this matter is dealt with effectively and that it is possible to work with the relevant organisations and with the people on the ground who either depend on bushmeat for income or for protein to survive . #% There is no way that can be held to be acceptable . #% A wide-ranging investigation and a public explanation are required by those whose concerns have been justifiably raised by this very serious incident indeed in Japan . #% Outside the EU , where F-gas technology will remain mainstream , the service networks for such systems will simply not exist . #% Despite the viciousness of his accusations he has never once provided with this list -- strange justice indeed . #% There is no doubt of the need to diversify , but there are not many new ideas out there . #% From the earliest stages in the bovine TB eradication scheme , the Department of Agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing , and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably . #% The next report , by Mr Nicholson on cod in the Irish Sea , clearly shows the failure of the present approach to fleet management . #% Likewise , the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament . #% Our fishing industry is in the process of being entirely eliminated . #% We need a UN peacekeeping force at least 20 000 strong on the ground in Darfur if we are going to stop it . #% Unfortunately , when it comes to the peace process , we do not see too many women around the negotiating table ; but when it comes to peace-making and peace-building in communities and neighbourhoods , it is often women who take the leading role ; women who have an understanding that peace is not just about political statements , or documents signed or agreements negotiated . #% Thank you for agreeing to take the question . #% If we undertook sensible policies , there are three things we could do which would almost eliminate the problem of climatic change . #% People are suffering . #% The IND/DEM Group agrees with Mr Schulz that Commissioner McCreevy should be called before this House to account for his statements on the European social model . #% There is no discrimination against the Spanish fleet . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Mr President , scientists in France recently discovered extensive organ damage in the liver and kidney in animals raised on Monsanto 863 . #% However , in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy . #% . Mr President , I welcome Mr Mavrommatis 's report and , indeed , I welcome the European Ombudsman here today to the European Parliament . #% On one of my many visits to the area , I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting , lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair . #% In many countries , for example , there are payroll taxes which contribute to the level of unemployment . #% Mr President , I join with other speakers in complimenting the rapporteur and welcoming his report . #% The draft recommendation leaves out a very important issue in that it fails to identify the threatened biodiversity of our coastal zones . #% Ever since the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year , the European Parliament has power of codecision in the whole area of transport policy matters . #% The European Convention on Human Rights , echoed in the new European Constitution , enshrines the right to life , freedom from torture , no punishment without law , freedom of expression , the right to an effective legal remedy and the right to liberty , security and a fair trial . #% Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , it is not and can never be a choice between employment or the environment . #% I have been arguing for the creation of an EU coastguard for some time , and welcome Mr Pex 's acknowledgement that such a body has an important role to play in implementing these rules by carrying out spot checks . #% The most effective way is by guaranteeing proper wages and ensuring that people can maintain as much of their own earning potential as possible to reduce labour taxes . #% At a time when many of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East , we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living . #% We have excellent ambassadors there but they simply do not have the structures to make the necessary impact on the political situation . #% I would ask that we all do that . #% Traffic has to come off the roads . #% The implementation of the Waste Management Act of 1995 is also a positive step in the right direction . #% I am very concerned at the attendance and surprised that there has been so little participation in this House by our British colleagues during this whole debate on the Irish presidency . #% In addition , the public in general is anxious to know how the original cost compares to the final cost ? #% I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem . #% As parliamentarians we should have acknowledged Green Week and the biodiversity loss focus by having a debate on that issue . #% The Parliament has to address human rights abuses within the Union . #% First , there is a difference between synthetic DHA and DHA in breast milk . #% The proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals . #% Can you guarantee to make available all consultations on the web so that these will be available for consultation ? #% I ask the Commission once again to consider , on another issue , an application to the WTO , or GATT , to have our beef export quotas increased . #% These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside . #% Too often when we bring in special laws and new laws in response to these kinds of emergencies or situations , they stay on our books after the emergency has passed and can be utilised again and again . #% There are very few people in any of our countries who have not themselves been the victims of criminal acts or whose families have not been affected by crime one way or another . #% Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ? #% None of our countries should hesitate about signing up to closer cooperation in the fight against such crimes . #% If this issue remains unaddressed , it is not just Sudan that will suffer . #% Much still needs to be done . #% I believe that it is imperative for Parliament to retain the power of codecision on strategic priorities , geographical and thematic aid programmes . #% Over 95 % of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world . #% One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new programme for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU/IMF programme of support to Ireland . #% Bloodless or not bloodless , a coup is a coup . #% We would also like to see States create a stronger possible verification regime in order to curb the hostile misuse of biological technologies . #% We have to be vigilant . #% Now some amendments to the Fiori report go further than the Caudron report . #% The lessons of the past have been learned and tremendous care has been taken to ensure that every link in the food chain is checked for soundness . #% In all , the current legislation encourages a reduction in emissions of 25 fluorinated gases -- hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride -- through containment , responsible use , recovery , destruction and disposal . #% It can do so by working with the interim government which is to be formed in the next few days ; by supporting early elections ; and , most importantly , undertaking to fully respect the outcome of elections and working with the new administration that emerges from those elections . #% 
That was one of the decisions of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in its opinion on the report . #% They perform a very important role in the social life of villages and rural communities , promoting a whole range of activities and participating in local associations . #% But so be it . #% That is not always clear to them . #% The EU must take a stronger lead in gathering essential research on any possible harm from EMFs and to recommend guidelines for its citizens . #% We can not put one human life above another . #% There is a happy medium and a balance between both , which must be maintained . #% Mr President , I too would like to raise the issue of the visit by the Colombian President , Mr Uribe , to this Parliament . #% It is also essential that citizens have the right of redress and that they are not kept in the dark as to proposals relating to their property , either when they are buying property or when they are in possession of it . #% Is it not time once and for all for the Council of Ministers to meet in public on all these matters when it acts as legislator ? #% It is important to recognise that DAPHNE has been one of the most successful European projects . #% Surplus beet is of limited value to growers and an ethanol plant would provide an alternative outlet for a significant quantity of such beet . #% We must respect that decision . #% How will these relate to the regulations ? #% But at the moment the high risk is with the dairy herd , the six and seven year-old cows and that is why , since I spoke last year , we have had the destruct scheme that was announced on 13 December 2000 , if I recall correctly , that will be in place until the end of this year . #% At the insistence of this Parliament , free repairs or replacements will also include postage , labour and materials . #% I want to thank the Committee on Budgets for their understanding and support for the Agriculture Committee 's amendments on the Dairy Fund , on our funding for the school milk and fruit scheme , for the bee populations , and the deprived persons programme . #% While what has happened in Asia is unfortunate , we have to protect the European market , because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry . #% Firstly , I would like to focus on Timothy 's report on the draft Council Decision adopting the rules on the confidentiality of Europol information . #% The Annual Report is an essential tool in assessing the activities of the Cohesion Fund . #% Mr President , I too would like to thank the Commissioner and , in particular , the rapporteur for his work on this issue . #% Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed . #% I would be inclined to say to the Commissioner that , no matter what you call it or how you achieve it , what you should do is to take the problem , give it a good shaking , get on with it and to try and force Member States to bring about the result everyone agrees is required and sort out how it will really affect the industry . #% That being said , the majority of the report is worth supporting , as a strong statement against the process of extraordinary rendition , as a breach of international law . #% In particular , this issue , which is difficult and has been a very arduous task for all of us in the Legal Affairs Committee , has thrown up a number of conflicts , one of which most often mentioned within this House is the conflict between copyright-holders and consumers . #% Mr President , everyone agrees with the objectives of this proposed directive . #% Indeed , in her reply , she referred to the action plan , the climate strategy and the Sixth Framework Programme . #% I wish to take the opportunity of warning the Council and the Commission to be careful , as Mr McCreevy 's continued eurosceptic approach could well be an indication of his intention to provoke another row with the EU over Ireland 's budgetary policy in the run-up to a possible autumn Irish general election . #% Let me also assure colleagues that there is a tougher side to the personality of the President , as I have seen in another House in another place . #% I urge that we do not desert this principle . #% I look forward very much to hearing what the Council and the Commission propose . #% We have a duty to take real decisions on their behalf , not on the altar of any ideology but according to what we believe is in the best interests of the people of Europe . #% Neither the Israelis nor the Americans want to give us any significant role . #% In this lecture Dr Ratner warned his Irish listeners to continue to choose life and , among the many benefits this brings , avoid the demographic suicide of our European neighbours . #% Would he not agree with me that the hype being put forward in the media about intensive farming/factory farming has nothing to do with all this ? #% I am particularly pleased that there will be a lighter disclosure regime for rights issues . #% Mr President , Irish Socialists too are very pleased that we have arrived at this moment . #% We know where we stand ; we have recorded votes on the basic principles of the budget vote , and it would be helpful if we avoided trying to replicate something about which we have , in substance , already reached a decision . #% This regulation was based , curiously and questionably , on design criteria rather than performance criteria . #% It has also seen families of children with disabilities badly treated , like the O'Cuanachains , hounded through the courts at a cost of millions just this year instead of their five-year-old child being given an appropriate education . #% I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point . #% We must act to make sure what is happening is stopped . #% She did not come down on one side or the other or make any such suggestion . #% Let us not pit those people against children in our own Member States going to school on bread and jam , which I deplore also . #% We are aware of the significant growth in the EU audiovisual market - 16 % per annum - which makes it the fastest growing audiovisual market in the world . #% Life is still cheap in the Middle East and we will continue to count the cost of the recent war for a very long time . #% I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens , and that we must do something positive about it . #% We must structure society and family life today in such a way that it allows women to have a second child . #% Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet , strengthening Europe ' s competitiveness in the knowledge economy . #% Mr President , in relation to the vote on the McCarthy report , I wish to say that my explanation concerns the Irish situation . #% Here in Parliament over the last six weeks , we had a series of hearings where we put the Commissioners-designate through their paces . #% Yesterday , we grieved publicly for the victims of the irresponsible and immoral war in Iraq by wearing black armbands . #% That was why there was such universal goodwill and support for the brave steps taken by the current Prime Minister , Ranil Wickremesinghe , and the LTTE in launching a peace process to end the terrible conflict in which 65 000 people have lost their lives , many thousands have been maimed , and untold harm was inflicted on the economy and indeed the quality of life of the Sri Lankan people . #% The forms that it is replacing -- E111 , E128 , E110 , and E119 -- sound more like food additives than health passports , but I am pleased that this card will now replace those in good time . #% However , I recognize that we have serious ethical considerations in this directive . #% I have spoken on this many times in this House over the last 20 years . #% I also wish you to note a clause in relation to the abolition of the death penalty . #% Mr President , I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman for his excellent report . #% Instead there is the positive recognition that we have an obligation to assist the fledgling democracies in the former communist countries . #% It should have been reviewed well before now and incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty or gotten rid of totally . #% Furthermore , bags and containers used for waste selection must also use the same colour codes and symbols in all the EU member countries . #% People have a duty to address the realities of life and one of those realities is that drugs are available and that young people and vulnerable people are being exploited by this . #% There is normally a 13 to 14-month laying cycle for hens that go into conventional cages . #% The comments of that BNFL director are verging on the extraordinary . #% They simply have to be if animals are to arrive at their final destination in good condition - acceptable to the final recipient . #% Copenhagen or no Copenhagen , climate change will be with us for decades to come . #% 
Some people may not like the fact that the Technical Group has been set up , but it has been . #% Of course those living in or at risk from poverty are hardest hit . #% I have to say bluntly to the Commission that if it can not get the policy right in the next four to five years , then it will be forced to hand it back to national governments . #% Let us realign the Fifth Frame Work Programme in its mid-term towards much more research into and development of those alternatives . #% This is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States . #% The Commission says that this is too difficult for all sorts of reasons , though it was one of the focal points in the recent partnership agreement discussion paper which the Commission produced . #% It should not , as the rapporteur has said , involve robbing the first pillar in order to fund the second . #% Last weekend 's political sparring and lack of conclusion to the summit was not worthy either of you , Mr Blair , nor of Mr Chirac . #% We then debated a proposed position for Parliament , which was voted on in this Chamber . #% We have recently had a very significant success concerning a French mother and a German father . #% What industry needs more than anything is legal certainty and , given the precedent case law , this is not the direction in which we are going . #% As a mutually beneficial agreement advancing scientific knowledge and technological progress , I am very pleased to support this measure . #% At the same time we must not strangle or restrict freedom of access for legitimate users . #% Although we have set the very high aspiration that within a decade we should become the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world , we are moving towards it at a lesser pace than ought to be the case . #% We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and play a central role in providing all the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq over the coming months . #% The principle was clearly established in 1993 that directives are to avoid imposing administrative , financial and legal restrictions which would affect these kind of undertakings . #% In my own constituency in Dublin only this weekend I have seen a family who have lost two young women during the last year as a result of drug abuse . #% Due to the particular nature of diseases such as rare cancers , auto-immune diseases , toxic and infectious diseases , there is not enough expertise and resources available for them , yet nevertheless they affect 36 million EU citizens . #% There are a number of other serious implications arising from parttime work which should be brought to the attention of the Commission . #% Is that the price to be paid for jingoism of this kind ? #% We must continue to coordinate with countries where high levels of illegal immigration originate and we must ensure that organised criminals involved in the sinister business of human trafficking are arrested and prosecuted for their crimes . #% It does not address the question of how the current situation in Iraq evolved over the last two years and therefore fails to criticise the Bush Administration 's defiance of the UN in its rush to invade Iraq . #% We can not stress enough that closing the gap between poor and rich Member States - achieving cohesion - means Member States must take the responsibility seriously . #% in writing . - MEP Záborská has presented a report which presents a definition of the term ` work ' which includes non-monetary and informal labour , which extends recognition to non-market-based or non-remunerated work . #% I would also briefly like to mention Mrs Harkin 's European Foundation report , which unfortunately is not being debated in the House , but is being voted on tomorrow as well . #% Drug addiction is one of the greatest threats to modern society . #% Next it will be income tax and fiscal harmonization . #% Any possible evolution in this area will be by way of additional resources and additional assistance . #% While 80 % of the people in our own prisons are there because of drug-connected crime , some of them are not . #% The proposal for this guarantee fund is both timely and progressive . #% From an Irish perspective , while we are satisfied that economic progress has been made in recent years , there is need to underpin this progress . #% in writing . - I strongly support this Resolution which calls for an immediate ceasefire by the Sri Lankan army and the LTTE in order to allow the civilian population to leave the combat zone . #% We now have the tools , for example the SWIFT clearing system in Europe , which would enable us to apply a tax . #% In particular I believe that representation within the European Commission should be based on a system of strict equality between small and large states . #% Finally , I wish to touch on two further points . #% The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland . #% I often feel that in this conflict , courage is not being shown . #% We also need to stimulate research and innovation through tax incentives or innovation vouchers , and by improving the conditions for risk capital investment , for instance for business angels or cross-border venture capital . #% Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects , we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages . #% I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter . #% These meetings afforded a rare opportunity to take decisive action to rectify the dangerous situation of the EU fisheries . #% There are 42 million people in the world who are sufferers of the AIDS virus - many of whom are based in Africa - yet the technology and the treatment is available to combat diseases such as AIDS . #% The people of Europe want a budget that serves their interests and a budget that serves the political objectives of the European Union . #% One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food . #% The compromise which the rapporteur agreed will lead to legal uncertainty and remove an essential power of discretion from judges and national courts . #% The full benefits of biotechnology will not be manifest unless public trust and approval are first secured . #% I just wish to let the House know that an intergroup on East Timor has now been set up , and people who are concerned about the Indonesian occupation of East Timor should get involved in the intergroup . #% You will find that a significant number of them will probably make that choice . #% It beggars belief that this undemocratic attitude is being expressed here by the Irish Greens and by others . #% I ask the House not to deviate from this figure , which can be accommodated within the existing guidelines , and also to support amendments on compensation for extensification , the rural world premium and funding for market developments . #% Madam President , coming from Northern Ireland as I do , I have to say that there is hypocrisy in both President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair . #% It is for this reason that we must quickly put beyond doubt the safety of all food , including beef , through a credible and totally transparent traceability programme . #% I very much welcome the fact that a draft resolution has been tabled at the United Nations on the subject of how to deal with the post-conflict situation in Iraq . #% Protection of European consumers , and of the integrity of the food chain , remain at the heart of the concerns of Members of this House . #% Therefore we need to become rational in our approach to this particular issue . #% On freedom of expression , despite reform packages -- and we are now on the ninth -- journalists and writers are not free to comment openly and critically on Turkey or its government members . #% That is not efficient , and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic à la Lisbon Declaration . #% After the summit failure , the immediate need was for a period of calm reflection by Member State governments and EU institutions . #% I welcome the appointment of Jean Claude Trichet and wish him well in his onerous duties as head of the ECB . #% in writing . - Labour Euro MPs are responding to the public 's call for fair taxation of the financial sector . #% We have a right - in fact a duty - of participation . #% Do you really think that could have happened if there had not been cooperation - not just between them , but cooperation all the way to the Far East ? #% A wholehearted response is required . #% We should remember at this time that the European Union budget only amounts to a little more than 2 % of the overall spending undertaken by the 15 Member States of the Union in any given year . #% There is a clear need to lay down a strict , enforceable framework of rules governing the nature of the products we are discussing . #% Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy . #% 
Mr President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating and thanking the rapporteur , Mr Mantovani , for his work , and also to thank the Commission for coming forward with the proposal . #% If we can not protect our future which is our children , what point is there in protecting the present ? #% We are now facing another human catastrophe in Africa . #% I warmly welcome the outgoing President-in-Office of the Council and his European Affairs Minister Gay Mitchell on their formal visit to the European Parliament to bring to a conclusion Ireland 's presidency of the Union . #% The Israeli Government must come to realise that missiles , demolitions , apartheid walls and assassinations will not guarantee or bring it sustainable peace . #% Unfortunately on Alzheimer 's disease it does no more than finance research and this is just not good enough . #% It goes without saying that the European Parliament must support a whole raft of measures to control environmental pollution in order to comply with its obligations under the Kyoto Agreement to reduce the level of European Union emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8 % by the years 2008-2012 . #% If we do not have the vets on the ground , particularly in remote areas where it is not viable to have veterinary practices , we have no detection system for the future . #% Even then the EU ' s institutional response has been largely focused on the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking and not on the wider set of EU issues that affect children . #% Many of the asylum procedures in all our countries , particularly my own at the moment , seem to be taking a particularly long time . #% The Fianna Fail MEPs reluctantly voted in favour of this proposal . #% I would stress to certain colleagues that there is no basis in the Treaty to support such a link . #% In this regard , I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline . #% The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia , which I support without reservation . #% The government is presently formulating its national development plan outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the years 2000-2006 . #% Yet they tell us today that Iraq must have its weapons destroyed . #% It is incumbent on the international community to redouble its efforts to find a solution . #% I want to speak directly to the Spanish President-in-Office at this point . #% The fields concerned are created not only by high voltage lines and broadcasting transmitters but by ordinary household appliances that we are all in regular contact with , such as mobile phones and television screens . #% The beef crisis has diverted attention away from fighting unemployment and international crime . #% From listening to this debate , one would not think so . #% What did the Commission do ? #% The lack of transparency in most Member State processes to determine their first NAPs has resulted in legitimate questions and concerns on the validity of the data within the first set of plans . #% When governments set targets for reducing CO2 emissions , they have a responsibility to introduce mechanisms and structures that will facilitate this . #% The best available method of ensuring job security for workers is by maintaining and , in many cases , improving the competitive advantages enjoyed by European-based industries . #% But we must be careful and remember that an extensive amount of work remains to be completed before a European Union Constitutional Treaty is agreed . #% We have an array of legislative measures which should go a long way to preventing future outbreaks and , more importantly , to ensuring that any such outbreak does not reach the proportions witnessed last year . #% I hope these rumours of so-called financial sanctions to be taken against Ireland are untrue . #% We need to look at the single market to ensure that it does not contradict the aims of this directive and we need to make sure that renewables take their full place when we consider the Security of Supply Green Paper . #% In this context , I am pleased to see that credit unions , cooperative banks and other mutual financial institutions can operate the fund , because they are often closer to those who may wish to access this particular facility . #% It is particularly important in this critical phase of talks for the EU to continue its commitment and for the International Fund to give a signal to our international partners that we still need to underpin the peace process with grass roots projects . #% We need to enable Europe , which is lagging behind in e-commerce and Internet business worldwide , to put in place new arrangements with regard to creation of on-line business and the protection of consumer rights and also to ensure that Europe takes its rightful place at the top of the world trading system of Internet and on-line businesses . #% The importance of the family in promoting or hampering social integration among youth is clearly recognised within society today , as well as through various studies . #% The Irish Government intends to propose a joint action to serve as a legal base for the allocation of funds from the budget of the European Communities . #% His fiancée , Bridgeen , his children , his family , are caught up in a fight at a time when they should be free to grieve and work towards closure . #% I endorse very strongly what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have said on the need to keep people informed . #% Darfur should be a priority debate in Parliament this week and we believe it would be a missed opportunity to delay that debate and resolution until next month . #% This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution . #% So I would like to encourage the Commissioner to ensure that we get a speedy agreement . #% Tattoos , however , are much less satisfactory . #% I would ask people to remain committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals . #% European funding alone can not achieve this for them . #% The Roure report 's focus on both migrants and women is commendable and particularly relevant again to my home country . #% There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road , which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view . #% Larger firms are , of course , aware of this . #% I call on the Commission and the United Kingdom Government - because in the past they have not shown themselves to be prepared to put up the matching funding - this time to put their money where their mouth is and make sure they give support to these communities . #% If a Portuguese or Dutch citizen were to smoke on board an Irish ship in international waters , that would break Irish law . #% You have actually got it wrong , Commissioner . #% We know that the majority of suicide cases are linked to mental health , particularly depression . #% It is an island with predominantly westerly winds and therefore significantly protected from contamination by GMOs from neighbouring countries . #% Please put pressure on the Irish Government to finally ratify Aarhus , even at this late date , and see the people as an ally rather than an enemy in the effort to protect the environment . #% The implementation of such safety systems in all vehicles will come into effect from 2006 onwards . #% So we need to look very carefully at how that reserve would work . #% Secondly and more importantly , effective control of arms exports is an essential part of a coherent policy that meets EU objectives on peace , respect for human rights and democracy . #% The citizens of this Union are our judges and juries . #% My second point is that Mr Oostlander is perfectly within his rights to say that , under Rule 115 , proceeding with the debate or the vote can be questioned as the documentation was not available 24 hours in advance . #% If the Commission is intent upon developing ` motorways of the sea , ' promoting sea transport and establishing shipping links as part of the trans-European network , sea-faring countries such Ireland must be given equal treatment . #% I believe the Commission has lost control of the Common Fisheries Policy and is simply becoming the poodle of the Spanish Government and the industry in Spain . #% Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by 9 % by estate agents Hook and McDonald , by between 8 % and 10 % by Sherry Fitzgerald and by 7 % by Friends First and IIB , while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between 3 % and 6 % . #% Business-to-consumer communications are particularly important for the elderly , the housebound and for those with family responsibilities who are finding it difficult to juggle work and career , overwhelmingly women . #% The UK would be in class 4 , Ireland would be in class 3 under either classification system , the SSC or the OIE . #% Apart from blood and blood products , it will also cover the whole area of patients donating their own blood prior to surgery in hospitals and cover regulation in that area specifically as well . #% Mr President , what recourse have we in this Parliament to such cowardly responses to serious questions ? #% Work and efforts to make progress on these issues must intensify considerably . #% We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation . #% On Thursday we will vote on a package of priorities for Parliament 's reserve in which Northern Ireland will be accorded the priority of being the first among equals . #% 
Therefore , on that score , I suppose I should say : let us have more of them ! #% It is hard to see how it will lead to a reform of the Palestinian Authority . #% Many of these older farmers are at present subject to scaremongering , with inaccurate information from their cooperatives . #% However , we must also learn from the mistakes of the past . #% As a result of the adoption of this text and other proposals , I abstained on the final vote . #% Commercial banks multiply the money supply issued by at least 10 to 15 times , and this is the reason that states get into debt , i.e. so that banks can make these huge profits . #% author . - Madam President , I just want to comment on two matters raised in the debate so far . #% It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer . #% We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes . #% The President-in-Office has dealt very fully and sympathetically with this question . #% I believe that we as legislators have a duty first and foremost to ensure the highest standards of public health protection . #% Genetic modification has been part of food production since the beginning of agriculture . #% Better knowledge about complementary and alternative medicine can provide an important contribution to the ability of citizens to make better informed and responsible choices regarding their health . #% In this regard , I anticipate with some enthusiasm a positive response by the Irish people to the Treaty of Nice . #% If that is taken out of the calculation , the rate of fraud and error , as best we can make it out , is about 1 % . #% To conclude , Europe has a role to play in promoting health . #% UK barometer-making , like that in other Member States , is a traditional industry dating back several centuries . #% There is no point in trying to tackle it at only a national level . #% In those circumstances , I understand , considering that this is a market which has traditionally been supplied with Irish beef , that this is a deliberate discriminatory act which has been declared and confessed by the people concerned . #% No consumer wants to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on animals for the sake of the food chain , or make criminals of our vets . #% BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly . #% More importantly , thank you for addressing us in a language that was devoid of Eurospeak . #% But if the single market is to grow , then we need to make it easier for consumers to shop across borders with greater confidence . #% For example , we all recall the introduction of decimalisation and , despite our assurances at that time , consumers experienced price increases . #% Own-account truck drivers will work all the hours that they get because they are not sure when they will get another job . #% One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up , not simply in excellent communications , which we welcome , but in follow-up , follow-up , follow-up !!!! #% But I enjoyed our very interesting discussions and I am very pleased that we achieved a result . #% As a member of the transport committee I believe it is the role of the European Parliament , as co-legislator , to do everything possible to have such a list quickly established . #% The maternity care services are appalling . #% While I appreciate that this is a complex technical issue , there is more that could be done to police this particular abuse . #% Once the new European supervisory authority becomes fully functional , fund managers will not be able to market their products in the European Union unless they hold a European passport certifying full compliance with this directive . #% These people represent 10 % of the population , yet they are excluded from so many walks of life . #% I am very unhappy that the non-take-up of funding has been a dominant theme in the media and is discrediting the good work that we do in structural funds . #% The interests of passive bystanders like Ireland , a country which chose to remain nuclear-free and is not a transit state , are not covered by the proposal . #% It is not acceptable at this point for that industry to bear that particular burden . #% Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq , the most important thing to do now - and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this - is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid , facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions . #% Bearing in mind that voters will be going to the polls in both Britain and Ireland next Thursday , it would be somewhat ironic , indeed tragic , if we were to witness a massive rejection of euro-scepticism in Britain while at the same time it gained significant ground in Ireland . #% Simply put , in the case of agreements there must be clear scientific proof that added fishing pressure from proposed EU activities will not compromise sustainability of fish stocks . #% That temporary tie-up funding is part of a rescue and restructuring package severely curtails its usefulness as a support measure ; and that the aid ceiling has only increased to EUR 30 000 over 3 years is also very restrictive and inequitable in relation to other sectors . #% It aspires to improving a situation that is indeed common . #% Let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from Luxembourg to Brussels , where it can use its skills working with other departments of the Commission . #% Now I understand that one Member State - although perhaps I am being unfair in this - raised some objection to that . #% At the same time , asylum issues are growing in importance . #% That is people power ! #% While , as a Socialist , I believe that guerrillaism under the conditions in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution , the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military repression . #% Recent figures show that the population could increase by up to 10 % over the next 10-15 years . #% The International Renewable Energy Agency aims to become a centre of excellence for renewable energy , which will enable it to help governments harness renewable energy sources , to disseminate know-how and best practice , and to provide training in this field . #% I am glad that my own church has a programme to that effect and is working hard on it . #% We are not in fact meeting our energy commitments under Kyoto at all . #% Clearly , though , the organisations I am working with have tried desperately hard to stop this campaign of spamming our e-mail systems . #% I do not agree with my Irish colleagues . #% One of the sectors of the European Union with a high percentage of CO2 emissions is the construction sector , and technological decisions in the construction sector have a long-term effect on the emission rates of all our Member States . #% When we talk about the failure of the Commission , we are talking about its failure to control the national governments and the regional authorities , which is not always an easy task . #% However , our role should not just be to approve this Fund . #% For yourself and the leader of a political group to invite him and for him to turn you down would imply that somehow he is refusing to come before this House . #% What the Commission is doing is over-severe , and it is particularly important that we watch the budget for 2007 . #% Apart from industrial competitiveness , of course , as Mr Desama says , we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right . #% Here , we are talking about balance and the need to get it right . #% Mr President , the world is full of conflict and dictatorship , hardship and poverty and it is the innocent victims who pay the price . #% The European Union has to impose an arms embargo on Indonesia . #% And you handed over the working class of Greece and the poor of Greece to the tender mercies of these parasites - criminals in fact . #% I know that Nice does not impact on Irish neutrality . #% Commissioner , I do not know whether this is a PR exercise and we do not really want the truth to get out to those who might be listening . #% The title was changed from ` The Declaration on Climate Change ' to ` Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability ' . #% We need a revised treaty that is truly relevant to the needs of ordinary people . #% There has been much talk in the Council and elsewhere about the problems of dealing with terrorism , yet we forget that such a danger could exist on our seas just as easily as in the air . #% 
I should like to come back to Objective 5 ( a ) and particularly budget line 886 . #% On an overall level , payments in the 2007 budget must reach 1.04 % of EU GNI if we are to deliver effective programmes to our citizens . #% This directive goes a long way towards ensuring that this does not happen . #% Legislation is in place in Ireland , as part of the health and safety legislation , to ensure that large companies put in place codes of practice to deal with bullying . #% It was established last year and I genuinely believe that it is an important forum for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the Icelandic Parliament . #% We must show leadership as must the media , educational institutions and the churches ; they have not shown such leadership in the past . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate and in so doing acknowledge the positive role of Parliament in setting the agenda for the highest standards of environmental protection . #% It is one thing to be in a job and have this condition , but if you have the condition it is virtually impossible to access a job subsequently . #% We need to reintroduce some level of capital control and not turn ourselves into a completely open space for multinationals , which is what Europe is being turned into . #% I do not support a one-China policy ! #% I believe that more progress can still be made . #% It is all the more welcome , therefore , that we in Parliament should take the initiative in matters such as this where we can make a real and tangible contribution to the rights and legal protection of our citizens . #% Assisting developing countries in setting up fair and effective tax systems is another issue to be strengthened . #% In Silvermines , County Tipperary , a 147-acre , 40-foot high plateau of fine red toxic tailing pond blights the area and in dry weather the dust blows across several counties . #% The only way to deal with these issues is through common action at a global level . #% We must sit where these people sit , we must recognise the circumstances that they are in , and we must do everything in our power to seek to help them in their dire plight . #% He used a STOA inquiry which is exactly what we should do in this Parliament to test our views . #% That is my main concern . #% The biofuel boom several years ago , coupled with the global food crisis in 2009 , has shown us how scarce a resource food is beginning to become . #% That is something again we will have to work on and similarly with core labour standards . #% The answer to difference is to respect it . #% Liberalisation of trade requires liberalisation of human rights in China . #% Finally , we must aggressively defend our interests on the international marketplace by basing our trading policy on the premise that overseas companies will only have access to our markets provided that we have equally good access to their home markets . #% The Commissioner , Mr Kinnock , whom I congratulated on his initiative on this point , has drafted a report into this question and has seen the positive benefits which could accrue from it . #% Farming in Europe as evidenced by yesterday 's 15,000 farmer demonstration continues to be difficult . #% I would appeal to the Commission and to the Council if they were here - they ignore the Petitions Committee , as well as ignoring Parliament - to give the resources that are necessary for these bodies to do their job . #% On this latter point , I note that Belgium is the only Member State still to ratify the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil aspects of child abduction and I would urge it to do so immediately . #% As Mrs Lynne has already said , it is not acceptable that the aid workers do not have access to the camps where people are dying . #% Internet service providers have a role to play in this . #% These offices and the staff assigned to work there are funded at considerable cost from the annual budget of Parliament . #% However , in terms of the scheme of things , it is the responsibility of this House itself to determine the nature of its travel allowance system , whereas for the Statute it is the responsibility of others to ensure that this House gets its act together in time for Vienna . #% Negotiations with the Council and the Commission - which should incidentally facilitate these negotiations - started in February 2010 . #% Mr President , I would like to compliment the rapporteurs on all the hard work they have invested in this report . #% Take away Sunday as the day of rest and we will lose much of the richness of community life as it has been experienced by Europeans throughout the centuries . #% As you are all aware , this is a matter of deep concern to the Irish people , who are particularly upset that there will be increased shipments of nuclear material through the Irish Sea in the near future . #% The creation of a single European market has largely removed the restrictions on the free movement of capital , goods and services throughout the Union . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , research and innovation are key to delivering growth and to meeting our biggest challenges . #% We want an end to the tyranny that has been perpetrated on the people of East Timor for the last 25 years with the help of EU countries , America and all these hypocritical people who want to sell arms to tyrants in Indonesia and other countries around the world . #% My question , Question No 8 , also deals with xenophobia . #% From a Community fisheries and socio-economic point of view , its real interest is the hope which it holds out to people of the fisheries-dependent regions of Spain and Portugal , such as Andalucia , the Canary Islands , Galicia and the Portuguese south . #% We are able to reject the fuel , but not to reject the risks when our neighbours accept it . #% I welcome the restated commitment of President Clinton to ratify this treaty as well as his renewed commitment to the maintenance of the US moratorium on nuclear testing . #% Firstly , what consultation before the money is made available has been organised with research foundations , for instance universities , private research foundations and so on ? #% I believe it is wrong to draw parallels or to say all processes are exactly the same . #% We do that by a series of moves , through legislation and other areas , to ensure that the common good and individual rights are protected . #% In West Dublin , in my own constituency and in the inner city the drugs crisis and heroin addiction have reached epidemic proportions . #% Agriculture is facing catastrophe in Europe , both inside and outside this Union , and it should be at the top of the agenda in this discussion . #% Do you take into account farmers on the periphery of Europe - Ireland , Greece , Spain or wherever - who can not get here ? #% As Parliament 's rapporteur on Hong Kong , the current status of the Macau Special Administrative Region holds obvious interest to me , and I have been fortunate enough to visit the region twice within the last year . #% We would ask , for example , that energy efficiency be used as an indicator in the Lisbon and Barcelona processes . #% My final point is in relation to bioterrorism . #% All the EU can do at this point is to address the consequences of the situation . #% However , there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments . #% In the light of these issues we should be cognisant of the difficulties which will be created . #% Mr President , a Bilderberg meeting will open in Versailles tomorrow . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome the Taoiseach , Minister Roach and Ambassador Anderson this morning . #% There is such a broad consensus for her report in the ENVI Committee that practically all amendments tabled were adopted , making the report somewhat long and repetitive in places . #% Martin Luther King said : ` Peace requires not only the absence of violence but also the presence of justice ' . #% Madam President , I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for their work on this issue . #% It concerns the last two paragraphs . #% The very fact that we have Dell workers ' committee representatives here tonight watching this shows just how deeply this fund has reached the workers of Dell and how they welcome it so much . #% The directive puts downward pressure on wages and provides companies with numerous loopholes which they can exploit to pay less than the minimum wage . #% In my country alone , two million blind and partially-sighted people could benefit from this directive if the Council and the Commission accept our amendments . #% When we take into consideration the fact that a lot of repressive legislation has been passed by the European Union in recent times without any public debate or any real participation by the citizens in the Member States , the very least we can do is ensure that the rights of people are protected . #% The revenue secured by patents and by licensing out our inventions to our global competitors gives us a return on the investment and assists us in creating jobs and growth . #% Now they are all gone and we are not producing enough food fast enough to feed ourselves . #% 
Ireland gains because it has a surplus in its trade with the rest of the Community , except the British . #% Also there have been cases highlighted where barriers were put in place and people who wanted to move from one Member State to the other could not have the qualifications recognised . #% He has learned to play the international community like an old violin , instinctively knowing how much pressure he can put on the strings without causing them to break . #% The European Union has no legal right to provide or promote abortion and it is unacceptable to use public funding for this purpose within the Member States , candidate countries or developing countries where it is unacceptable to communities . #% I consider that increasing demand in bioenergy would be achieved by prioritising research , development and demonstration of bioenergy and biofuels - particularly regarding second-generation and most efficient products - by promoting the creation of transparent and open markets and the removal of market barriers and through information campaigns involving producers , suppliers and consumers . #% Follow-up again , please . #% Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little , too late . #% We in Northern Ireland have problems . #% We also welcome the Commission 's proposal to provide funding for fishermen affected by this decision . #% The internet genie is out of the bottle : some 3.3 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers . #% Yesterday 's Napster ruling clearly showed that copyright has to be applied to cyberspace . #% in writing . - The trafficking of human beings is deplorable anywhere in the world , but particularly disgraceful in the European Union given our high levels of internal cooperation and resources . #% That is why we have tabled a number of questions to the Commissioner to assist in further developing and supporting the SOLVIT network . #% Let us stick to the facts . #% This is the second time this has happened to me and the third time it has happened to my colleague Mr Aylward . #% It is completely hypocritical to argue for the continued torture of animals in the interests of safety , whilst at the same time allowing dangerous products . #% While I accept that one could broaden the focus , I think the way he drilled it down in his first draft is the way it ought to stay because the greatest problem inside this Union is unemployment . #% However , in other areas - oil and minerals - and in every form of jurisdiction Member States have over their oceans , natural resources fall within the remit of the national governments . #% That is also an urgent matter . #% We must be determined to win this battle so that we will have a Treaty which will govern the European Union for the next 25 years . #% The market in weapons is now so competitive that some of the most horrific despots are getting bargain basement deals for weapons of mass destruction . #% I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's assurances on codecision here today . #% Unfortunately , national agencies , both police and voluntary , have not had the same success . #% So there really is an urgent need to tackle coastal zone management . #% I still judge that the draft directive does not provide adequate protection for farmers either here in Europe or in developing countries . #% Of course we all wish to thank Mr Marimón for his patience and good humour . #% How soon can we expect a clear and definitive view on the potential or otherwise of genetic research as applied to practical farming ? #% Legislation on catering waste , animal transport , animal welfare , surveillance and disease control must be properly implemented and monitored . #% That is not a superb victory for the cause of research and development . #% EU Heads of State have affirmed on a number of occasions that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people both collectively and individually must always be protected . #% It is unfortunate , therefore , that both the Commission and the Council are still taking the side of the cosmetics industry and those responsible for profit-driven torture of animals . #% Mr President , I would like to say a word or two of appreciation and thanks to the President-in-Office for his valuable contribution to the European Parliament this afternoon and to take the opportunity of wishing him and his colleagues who are guiding the UK Presidency continued success for the remainder of their term . #% The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably . #% That 's the only way we can offer them real pain relief instead of simply deferring and dragging out their suffering ! #% in writing . - I voted against this report as I have serious concerns in relation to the EU 's economic and political approach towards the countries that are covered by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement . #% President , the basic premise of terrorism is that the unexpected , the unconsidered , the unbelievable will terrify the population into accepting political claims , whether they are rational or not . #% To make mistakes will be catastrophic not just for the existing Member States but also for the countries wishing to join . #% Can she say what sort of time-scale is involved in arranging for Ireland - currently a single-zone territory for Objective 1 status - to be divided into more than one region so that areas in the west of Ireland , from Donegal down along the coast to South Kerry or West Cork , might be still considered for Objective 1 area status in the post1999 programme ? #% Society usually accepts a certain level of risk in return for an advantage and proponents of nuclear energy almost inevitably remind us of the balance of risk and benefit . #% I urge the heads of State and Governments to be similarly bold in proposing a package of measures for Bulgaria and Romania that will ensure that those States too may fully rejoin the European family of nations as early as possible . #% In conclusion , I would like to echo the support expressed by the Irish presidency for the compromise package agreed by the Italian presidency , the Commission and the rapporteur . #% The transport must be authorised by the competent authorities , but they must be contactable 24 hours a day , 7 days a week . #% This is an important directive that will , I am sure , be a vital contribution to public health in the European Union by ensuring a high quality of tissues and cells for transplantation , while at the same time respecting fundamental ethical considerations . #% At the same time , workers see the banks being recapitalised , while small and medium-sized businesses - the drivers of economic growth - are being starved of funds and jobs are being lost . #% This is not only injuring people but also adding insult to injury . #% I wish to welcome the President-in-Office and wish him well during the course of the Irish presidency . #% The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ( EGNOS ) is ten times more accurate than GPS and it is predicted that accuracy to 45 centimetres can be achieved in the near future . #% It is well known that PVC may present a risk when used in toys for young children . #% Where the original proposal was limited to CO2 , I am pleased that we in Parliament are more ambitious and intend to extend the scope of application to all other greenhouse gases . #% In December 2002 it was announced with great ado that the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was a great success and , amongst other things , it was said that recovery plans with effort reduction were to be applied . #% Unless we take action in this regard , there is a risk that these opportunities will not be available in the peripheral regions and that differences will become even greater . #% Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his very clear reply to the oral question . #% In that context perhaps the institutional arrangements need to be examined . #% The level of racism in our society is terrifying . #% A clear message must go out from this Parliament , from the Commission and from the Council to the fishing industry that honest endeavours will be respected and those fishermen who abide by technical conservation measures that are devised by accredited European scientists in partnership with fishermen will benefit most . #% Mr President , obviously my name is not Al Gore and this is not Florida . #% We look forward in Northern Ireland to continuing support from our friends in the European Union and we thank you for it . #% That is important too . #% We want competitive handicap to be addressed where it is a genuine problem but not to be used as an excuse for going soft on necessary change . #% While we strongly support measures to improve the situation of workers made redundant through the relocation of companies , we feel that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is not up to the task . #% Anybody who examines closely trends in public spending will find that , and the fact that this has not been identified by either the Commission or the Court of Auditors means that there is some weakness in our system of evaluation . #% The European Union will seek to protect natural resources that lie at the root of economic development , to strive for the promotion of eco-efficiency , promote the sustainable use of water land and energy as well as try and ensure that the vicious cycle of poverty and unenvironmental degradation is broken . #% First there was the Iran/Iraq war ; a war sponsored by the West in the main . #% I should like first of all to thank Mr Prodi for elaborating today at much greater length on a number of the priorities which he wishes to emphasise for the next Commission . #% The bottom line is that these new charges will increase the cost of transporting Irish exports into European markets . #% One of the core elements of the Committee on Foreign Affairs ' opinion is that the Council and the Commission should regularly raise the issue of human trafficking in political dialogues with third countries . #% 
The problem for my Group with the compromise package now proposed by the Council is where the latter insists on extending controls by slaughterhouse employees to include pigs and calves . #% In order to help address the Parliamentary Assembly 's concerns regarding the repercussions of the current crisis on the developing world , we need to work on additional sources of financing , especially an international financial transactions tax . #% It is no coincidence that practically the only area that has experienced substantial reforms is that of child protection , to some extent due to the interest taken in this by the European Parliament . #% Finally , having met a group of disabled people from Ireland yesterday and today on their Freedom Drive in Strasbourg , I was pleased to note that the rapporteur has invited the Commission to put forward an initiative to make tourism and leisure establishments accessible to people with reduced mobility . #% But what should we do ? #% Although radiological diagnosis provides undoubted benefits for patients , it entails risks , and for this reason we have to try to reduce the use of medical radiation where at all possible by employing alternative methods . #% We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while , at the same time , providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health . #% In other words we can get more from the carrot than from the stick . #% As a result of petitions submitted by EU citizens , Member States can be found guilty of infringing Community law . #% A number of the ideas raised and the suggestions put forward in the Commission study will have serious implications for Irish farmers and the Irish agricultural sector . #% Is it because the Commission knows that co-existence will not work ? #% In their interests and in our interests it is essential that we do this as a matter of urgency . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate , as I believe it gives us the chance to raise the difficult degrees of sanctions imposed on the fishing fleets in different Member States of the European Union . #% We need proper restrictions on the advertising of alcohol . #% In its over-zealousness to protect the cotton-weed , the local council decided to ban the pilgrimage from the immediate area . #% In the light of the fact that the Commission recently banned CMRs in its review of chemical directives but has included it as an exemption , it is ridiculous that a substance can be banned from paint and polish but not from something that is put on your body . #% We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world 's leading media broadcasters . #% Two of them clearly came through the transmission mechanism where there was no argument on competent authority . #% Indeed anybody who follows the Maltese media will know that it is the intention of the Maltese Government to hold a referendum on the issue . #% I also acknowledge and salute the defence which you , together with the European Commission , have mounted on the climate-change issue . #% The exclusive coastal zone is something that Irish fishermen are adamant about maintaining and so are fishermen from Scotland , Wales , England , France , Portugal and Holland , from Denmark , Germany and others - it is something that I am adamant must be retained . #% Madam President , I am not going to make this into a debate but since the question has been raised , I want you to confirm that it will be on the agenda and that we will have a statement from the presidency . #% The European Commission has already dispatched a needs-assessment mission to Iraq . #% We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling . #% Mr President , there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation . #% On the existing EU Treaties - including the recently ratified Treaty of Nice - or on an array of new proposals from the EU Convention ? #% Failure to reach a final agreement on the controversial Constitution will not mean failure for the Irish presidency -- unless of course the government is foolish enough to give the impression that such an agreement could somehow be reached . #% This would be preceded by a national stock-taking to analyse which actors , laws and institutions influence the planning and management of the coastal zone in order to ensure convergence of public bodies and local initiatives , to be completed by the end of December 2002 . #% In our desire to compensate all farmers affected , and in particular the farmers most affected , we should try avoid introducing an over-bureaucratic system which would only tend to slow down the payment of compensation . #% Seven countries are considering opt-outs from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court . #% Let me raise an issue with you in the Commission . #% We can all agree on one thing : farmers everywhere in the European Union certainly did not need this disease to come upon them at this moment in time , and certainly the farmers in the United Kingdom did not need it at all . #% Of course we are very much in favour of openness and transparency . #% The other thing is that the Commission does not want to fund the transfer of vessels to flags of convenience which flout international management regulations . #% There would be no custodians of the rural environment , and I would caution people to take that particular matter into consideration . #% In it they say `` we pray at your end , honourable European Parliamentarians , that justice may prevail on us '' . #% All the various pacts and conventions are inadequate . #% My last point is on the question of the six-week period . #% As an island nation , Ireland imports 80 % of its packaging material and has a very small indigenous recycling possibility ; we have a scattered population . #% Commissioner , I have a personal dilemma : I represent a country that is pro-enlargement but a region that is urging me to vote against Bulgarian membership . #% But some of his proposals would require a bureaucracy in Brussels ten times the size of the current Commission . #% I thought you might be interested . #% I am strongly of the view that all reports by committees of this House , whatever their status , should at least be available to Members of this House before they are available to those outside . #% Mr President , I would like to associate myself with the remarks of other Members of the House about the colleague of the lady from Scotland who has just spoken . #% He went to Burundi as Apostolic Nuncio and it was there , while returning from a pastoral visit in one of his dioceses , that he was murdered . #% To put this into context , more people will die in the European Union from the effects of a strain of TB that is drug-resistant than will be affected by avian flu . #% The new President-in-Office of the Council has said that he would not tolerate having any members of the IRA/Sinn Fein in the Dublin Government , but insists that we tolerate them if we are to have a government in Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom . #% But consider for a moment the plight of the millions of people in long-term unemployment and the many people who have never had a job and who struggle through life in dire poverty . #% What steps has the Commissioner taken to freeze the assets of Mr Mobutu which are held in Member States ? #% Having said that , we are now holding out a prospect of abolishing VRT and perhaps somewhat dishonestly indicating to Irish consumers that at last they may get a car at a much cheaper rate , in much the same way as in other Member States . #% This communication addresses the issue of the research and development ( R&D ) phase of a pre-commercial product . #% Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union . #% Be that as it may , I do not deny Members and colleagues the opportunity to table this motion of censure . #% With the amount of goodwill present , there should now be an opportunity for a specific article in the new treaty which the Dutch Government will - we hope - be bringing in under its presidency , to ensure that the rights and freedoms of children are fully and individually enshrined therein . #% It never seems to be explained that there is a long-term objective which can bring profits . #% The biggest problem still existing , as identified in our discharge motion for resolution , is the fact that , in the administration of the budget for the year 2000 , there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14 % . #% We have to ask ourselves the question : what is the best way to keep F-gases from being released into the environment ? #% Attempts by the Commission to introduce premature - and in the case of milk - unnecessary reform , have contributed to insecurity and unease among farmers . #% I hope that the record of this House will show very clearly where we stand in relation to this question . #% I believe it is entirely proper that Mr Poettering should demand that this issue be dealt with here this week and I would urge the Commission to give the necessary assurance , not only because I agree with the sentiments of Commissioner Patten , but because the world at large wishes to be reassured that there is no dysfunction at the heart of Europe on the question of enlargement . #% So save yourselves the trouble and admit that the Treaty is dead , with no prospect of resurrection . #% You referred to the Euratom regulations and directives a number of times , but the Euratom Treaty might as well be on the planet Zorg for all the democratic control that we have on it in this Union . #% I agree with the Commissioner on the need to rebalance the market . #% Several Member States are behind in their obligations to reduce their fleets and once again nothing is being done to improve matters . #% I have , along with Mrs Baldi and other members of my group , urged an embargo on armaments in the region because of the scale of the killings and abuse of human rights which is very frightening indeed . #% This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production . #% 
That is what it is about . #% I do have a reservation about paragraph 4 because the main terrorism , in fact , has come from the Rajapaksa Government against the people . #% This is just another example of the many qualitative examples of the EU at work for citizens . #% Another petition also raised very serious issues . #% The argument is about whether GEF will be the main source of funding and where that is going to be . #% I support that generally and , in particular , I support the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to have an impact analysis on implicit and standard rates of VAT in the Member States , which should also consider allowing all Member States the same opportunity to apply reduced rates on certain goods and services . #% Like in many industrial sectors , businesses are relocating to countries where they can exploit workers to their own advantage . #% Tragically her son Neil died of a deep-vein thrombosis after a short flight to Benidorm . #% The family should represent the safe haven for the child . #% Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% For the most part , we share the fundamental reason why the Convention was first established . #% If we concentrated on hyper-cars we could have 70 % to 90 % fuel savings . #% I fail to understand this , and with respect find it a discourtesy to colleagues . #% While I can distinguish between indirect taxes such as VRT and direct taxes such as income and corporation tax , Member States are entitled to order their affairs so that motorists contribute to the cost of providing public services , especially to the cost of road and rail construction and the maintenance of our roads . #% There are people out there with all kind of agendas and nobody knows exactly where the truth lies . #% Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur . #% The nuclear package represents a coordinated effort to prepare for further development of atomic power in an enlarged European Union and it has been stripped of all meaningful safety requirements . #% It is not their priority . #% In both cases the result of violence over the last few months has achieved the opposite to what was originally intended . #% We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations . #% If the truth be told , however , in many cases human rights clauses in EU agreements with third countries have not been worth the paper they were written on . #% Are we also willing to subject our climate to the point of no return ? #% Thirdly , you need to create institutions which respect those differences , and the fourth element is working together in the common interest . #% Other pieces of legislation are required to complete the coverage needed in this area and I would urge the Commission and the Council not to delay further in agreeing what is necessary . #% Hizbollah will claim that it is attempting to retake the Golan Heights , and Israel will claim that it is retaliating for these incursions by bombing Lebanon . #% However , the Commission 's communication is rather a hodgepodge which lumps together willy-nilly the publishing industry which is knowledge-based and content-focused with primary forestry industries and also paper production . #% What steps are being taken to deal with that issue ? #% I abhor this particular line of argument particularly in light of the fact that there has been a number of tragic deaths in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy . #% But if we have a common interest in the environment , a common interest in the economic welfare of the European Union , a common tourism policy and so on , it is realistic to think that we ought to have a common policy so far as forestry is concerned . #% We can all take solace from the fact that the key protagonists in this difficult political equation are now addressing the most vexed and thorny bottom line issues that have to be resolved if a permanent peace agreement is to be put in place in the Middle East . #% Antimicrobial administration to both humans and livestock entails the risk of resistance when used incorrectly and at inadequate doses . #% Mr President , I wish to join the others in thanking the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , for an excellent job well done . #% They feel they have nowhere to turn , that they have been heavily penalized and hammered by a large country and squeezed out by multinationals . #% It is very important that this authority is up and running as soon as possible , no matter where it is located . #% We are ten years down the road . #% As the rapporteur for Hong Kong , there are a number of issues about which I have concerns but I feel it is inappropriate to raise those concerns now . #% By the Commission 's own admission a new protocol was not negotiated because a scientific survey had not been conducted . #% I still believe that the subject of Structural and Cohesion Funds in Objective 1 regions is the competence of the European Union and as such deserves a more thorough answer . #% Mr President , may I add my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very welcome report . #% It is our job , the job of politicians , not economists , to try to find ways - new ways and novel ways - of raising this particular issue . #% Up to 125 000 jobs are supported in the EU 15 in nature protection related activities . #% Nevertheless , I question the meaning of the discharge and how useful it is as a tool , two years after the event and where , as in this case , management and personnel may well have changed . #% Whoever Mr Söderman 's replacement might be , and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way , he will have a lot to live up to . #% I agree that bee diseases should be highlighted in EU veterinary policy , both to highlight the importance of bees and also to have a policy and to monitor the population across Europe . #% The most recent estimates of the annual wild meat harvest are 23 500 tonnes in Sarawak , 67 000 to 164 000 tonnes in the Brazilian Amazon and between one million and five million tonnes -- off the bone -- in the Congo Basin . #% As recently as October a Eurostat publication said that transport accidents and suicide were the main causes of death of women in that age group . #% How can our views be taken into consideration when we are debating a report which has already been decided on by Council ? #% I would also like to emphasise that the concept of public service and of the public good must go hand-in-hand with liberalization . #% Mr President , the decision taken in this House today marks a great day for democracy and for the health of citizens throughout Europe . #% With all due respect to Mr Stevenson , who is a good representative of his people and very enthusiastic , I do not accept that the common fisheries policy is a failure . #% It is a fact that the forensic clean-up of the murder scene , the intimidation of witnesses , the offer by the IRA to murder the murderers and the refusal to cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland are politically motivated and can not be separated from the murder itself . #% There is a requirement to have a dry dock basin available for the dismantling of these ships , but it is unlikely that they can be dealt with in 180 days and indeed there is no dry dock basin available for the recycling of these ships . #% I have to say to the Commission , and to producers in other Member States , that my producers have to date not seen any financial benefit from that which they have suffered . #% I said it will raise the antennae of Mrs Van Dijk when she hears that and when I saw her name up to make a statement . #% in writing . - Parliament has given a strong signal in its resolution on the EU-Canada trade negotiations that it will rigorously defend its legislation to ban seal products from the EU market . #% It is sad they resorted to personal attacks when my report very much reflects the views of people in the regions . #% If we consider the question of the guidelines which we discussed this week , we see the difficulties and problems that were created , simply because we were not given the information in time . #% In all our translations of the report we have been very careful to monitor how it was translated . #% But this law is also about protecting consumers who have unwittingly been deceived into buying clothes , toys and household products made from cat and dog fur . #% Preserving the flexibility of Member States to decide what taxes to apply and at what rates is vital in achieving the social and economic objective of a country . #% The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation . #% The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small , and its impact is political rather economic - though that is important too . #% That is what the Tánaiste said to the House this morning . #% If it were not for the common agricultural policy , that would have been very painful . #% The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering . #% Farmers , vets and politicians all shared the great concern of the general public over the death and destruction of millions of animals , of which many , if not most , were not infected with the disease . #% 
As an island , we are very dependent on air travel for both tourism and business and , as one of the most open economies in Europe , we have , over the past decade , reaped the benefits of liberalisation of EU regulations regarding air services . #% Therefore , my group will be seeking separate votes on certain paragraphs , in particular within the Smet report . #% On the one hand , people are saying that we are not talking about or aiming for a single diplomatic corps , but it is quite clear that the aim of this whole project is to have EU embassies abroad and to abolish national ones . #% My next point touches upon the European institute for technology , research and development and what is required for that . #% I would reiterate the appeal by a previous speaker for the setting up of a competent , independent , scientific body to act as a watchdog and to communicate with the public at an early stage , especially through consumer associations . #% I intend to vote against the proposed draft Council regulation because I believe that the technical details have not been properly or fully investigated . #% It is a fairly trivial matter in one way and it seems that he has gone to extreme measures in his dealings with the people in Pakistan , with the judiciary in Pakistan , in the way he has dealt with it , which is extremely dangerous . #% To give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons . #% It is important that the terms of reference of this Convention are clear and decisive and that its conclusions in due course do not turn out to be an unattainable wish list . #% According to the World Health Organisation , in 2000 , for the first time in history , the number of overweight people in the world equalled those who were underweight -- more than one billion overweight , 300 million of whom are obese -- with the huge implications this has for morbidity . #% People can understand that and to some extent they can control the rate they pay by their choice of car . #% I was in Strasbourg yesterday evening but I omitted to sign . #% It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government . #% The jury is out and we are gambling in advance of Cancun with the critical part of Europe 's economic policy , the CAP . #% Mr President , the comments of Mr Crowley are a disgrace to this House ! #% I ask the Council here today to answer the question properly . #% I must say I am concerned that there will not be sufficient funds to achieve a positive outcome to sustain the future under the second pillar . #% However , it must be said that there is no doubt whatsoever that , without political will , nothing will change . #% There is no effective mechanism to hold Commissioner Mandelson to account . #% Yet this is not how EU funds are being applied . #% Firstly - and many people have mentioned this - is the whole question of the number of women at work , and this will obviously now be increased . #% Incidentally , it is not a matter for the European Union to tell Member States whether or not it is appropriate for them to have early decommissioning of their nuclear power stations . #% I appeal to the men of violence to lay down their arms , to stop their murderous acts of violence in Ireland and elsewhere . #% They are playing an invaluable role in creating peace and stability . #% We support EU reform that gives power back to the people , the elimination of poverty , support for public services , revitalised rural economies , and the reform and strengthening of the United Nations . #% Finally , it is very important that we introduce a promotional scheme right away to try and stimulate the consumption of beef . #% The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there . #% Often that is not made very clear . #% Straight in front of me I can see at least four people , just in this row here , who are Group staff - not Members . #% Mr President , the Guellec report does not impress me , for three reasons . #% I would like , first of all , to compliment Mrs Jackson for raising this oral question . #% We must learn from the difficulty and I invite the Commission at the earliest date to redouble its efforts to submit a new proposal , so that we can drive the Lisbon reform forward . #% I have submitted a number of amendments to this report to ensure that there will be no reduction in the dissemination of information through public libraries , educational facilities and so on ; that indigenous culture will be preserved and developed ; that the needs of disabled people will not be undermined by this legislation and that the cultural and social importance of major sporting events will be protected . #% There is a view that consumers are only engaging in buying CDs , books , low-value items , but of course we know that e-commerce is taking off in such way that soon they will be buying financial services , they will be buying cars . #% Furthermore , around 900 million people worldwide are chronically hungry due to extreme poverty , while up to 2 billion people lack genuine long-term food security due to varying degrees of poverty . #% The Commission 's role as Guardian of the Treaty and initiator of legislation is fully respected by this House and does not need to be constantly reiterated . #% I am delighted that the Commissioner and his staff have been adaptable enough to recognise that if the proposals put forward are not working as originally designed , the best thing to do is to , for example , concentrate on fewer projects in a more focused way and to increase the Commission contribution , since the 10 % clearly was not stimulating the sort of initiatives we wanted . #% It has been suggested that the small European countries lack the resources and the ability to undertake the onerous task of presiding over the affairs of the Union and that the present system of rotating the six-month presidencies should be abolished . #% I believe the European Union should co-operate on an international level in combating terrorism , organised crime and individual criminals , all of whom use the differences in legal systems to avoid standing trial . #% Let us heed the lesson that the EU is strongest when we focus on core areas where value can be achieved by working together in a common interest . #% I should like to thank Mr Trakatellis for an excellent report and I also thank the Commissioner for being so honest with us here this morning and stating that this Community action plan on health already needs to be reviewed if it is to be effective , so that we can prioritise areas , because of -- and I use his words -- ` the accounting muddle ' . #% We have to put pressure on Vietnam to release all prisoners who are being imprisoned or detained for peacefully expressing their religious and political beliefs . #% Save us from the oppressive uniformity that some would impose upon us and let the needs of each rule the day . #% These ensure a solid product growth that allows competition and ensures the diversity of supply and production afterwards . #% Ireland is somewhere in between at EUR 11 000 per capita . #% There are major issues at stake . #% They have found a previously unknown pathway by which radiation can subvert living cells . #% This report suggests that the abolition of VRT will be good for the Irish consumer . #% It therefore makes a lot of political sense for the European Union to take a lead coordinating role to promote better health within the European Union . #% The fact that she has not been seen and that her whereabouts is unknown raises serious concerns about whether she is alive and what kind of condition she is in . #% Finally , if we reject the Commission proposal , we will end up with bad law . #% Sellafield has an appalling record : it is accident-prone , it pollutes the air and our sea . #% Different Group motions were debated and a compromise common text was agreed and a decision taken by plenary . #% In Ireland alone the ratio is about 74 % for those travelling within the Community and 26 % for those travelling outside . #% We urgently need to streamline the way we carry out our business in Europe and the sooner we secure agreement the better . #% This family needs justice to get closure and completion of this saga and to grieve in peace . #% The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations . #% I do not think it satisfactory , even in the motion recently adopted by this House , to express the that this will happen by 2015 . #% Much can be gained from establishing partnerships between sporting organisations and educational establishments . #% Once properly implemented and extended to include all the other sectors , Kyoto will provide a flexible , market-based mechanism to spread the burden of paying for global warming equitably across all sectors . #% I said to Commissioner Flynn last year and I am repeating it here to you , Taoiseach , that I want to see us getting to the point where unemployment is at the bottom of our agenda , not because we are not interested in solving it , but because it has been solved . #% In relation to the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca , we can support all of them . #% Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well . #% It is also in breach of the directives that oblige the company to inform the workers of its intentions . #% Commissioner , I am glad that in your eighth report you bring out some of your tough instruments and make it clear that you will instigate infringement proceedings against those Member States which fail to transpose . #% Or is it still on the table for discussion and can it arise again for discussion in the near future ? #% 
We need certainty in our law . #% Proper safeguards will be needed . #% Secondly , Rule 19 governs order and the conduct of the House . #% Two types of inspections are foreseen , in particular , routine inspections carried out as part of a planned inspection programme and non-routine inspections as a follow-up to complaints in connection with the issue and renewal or modification of various licences . #% I thank him very sincerely for what he has contributed , and also his colleagues in the Commission . #% Is this the warning sign of what lies ahead , as the power of the WTO to shape our agriculture in Europe intensifies ? #% In this case , as in the ozone depleting substances regulation to which this proposal is related , that is environmental protection . #% Mr President , firstly I should just like to make a technical point . #% He has said that he will not change his principles or conscience for political convenience , and I would not expect him to do that , but it is going to be impossible for him in his particular portfolio , given the challenges that will be before him . #% It is not necessarily a good thing , but it is certainly a lot better than the problem of overspending , which we hear so much about at national level . #% Animal transport is central to Ireland 's agricultural economy . #% The EU is concerned about the growing use of flags of convenience . #% In Ireland , partly because of our own inaction and through our own fault , we currently have a nitrates directive based on rainfall , weather and climate , which is totally unworkable , but that is another story . #% Since the Veronica is now a flag-of-convenience vessel , what is the Commission doing to stop the Veronica from offloading in Las Palmas ? #% Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that . #% Why not some standing groups , on a rotating basis , who would be ready to go into the area when these sort of things occur ? #% Finally , we already have in place in the transport sector tachograph requirements which are rigorously enforced in all Member States and which may be one way of dealing with some of the concerns about the health and safety aspect . #% This new protocol fixes the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels in the waters of Equatorial Guinea during the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 . #% Women are not encouraged at school level , they face discrimination in their careers , and this is something which we have to tackle in the European Research Area . #% SOLVIT stepped in and contacted the local German authority , which then issued her with a temporary blue disabled parking badge -- again , that was the EU delivering for citizens . #% Mr President , that situation can not continue and needs remedying . #% Nevertheless there have been many cases where passengers have been denied boarding because of overbooking -- something which many in this Parliament will have experienced regarding some airlines in Europe -- and people have been left high and dry , whether it be in Brussels or somewhere else . #% The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy of Parliament is right to endorse the European Commission 's proposal for an international initiative for the Internet and electronic commerce . #% Therefore , it is really important that we pursue in good faith to bring the negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to fruition . #% I , like my colleagues , do not think that the European Union should be involved in setting out treatment programmes or setting out the delivery of medical services to individual citizens - that is obviously best dealt with at national or local level . #% We voted against this paragraph . #% All of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council have to accept responsibility for the present situation . #% Mr President , could I begin by congratulating Mr Parish on bringing forward a very excellent report . #% In my own constituency in the Peak district , I do not think that we want to attract Siemens actually to come and re-establish itself in an area which is environmentally sensitive , where we are looking to establish small businesses . #% I have to ask why all these ships are going such a great distance to catch 3 000 tonnes of tunafish . #% If we support network access for renewables in Europe , we should not find ourselves in this position . #% I believe it will be the hard-pressed consumers who will end up bearing the brunt . #% Energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth . #% This is a lesson in how not to resolve conflict within the EU . #% In the context of the challenging issues facing the Union , such diverse headlines , downbeat as they are , capture more vividly than I can the absence of strategic progress . #% We as a country have become familiar with Lebanon through family members or friends or neighbours who were stationed there and we feel the damage inflicted on their country all the more for this . #% He is fully correct in his approach . #% Those who claim that movement towards membership will induce Turkey into full democratic and human rights compliance are shown , even by the lack of appreciable progress conceded by this report , to be lamentably wrong . #% It is true that there are , in many cases , health and psychological reasons for breast implants , but we need to be careful in that regard . #% As my Party Leader in Dáil Éireann , Enda Kenny , said , Robert McCartney 's vicious beating and stabbing to death was ordered by a commander in the Belfast brigade of the provisional IRA , following a minor dispute between the commander 's uncle and the group with which Mr McCartney was socialising . #% Similarly , installation aid for young farmers is a key component in ensuring the future of farming , particularly in the more isolated regions which have a structure of small family farms . #% The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed . #% In conclusion , it is about time that these directives were brought together , that the texts were clarified and that greater certainty was put into the legislative framework under which people have to operate . #% the reference to the use of combat units ( battle groups ) and enhanced cooperation with NATO ; #% We must give every cooperation to Europol and do everything we can to prevent this drug abuse . #% It also points out that Ireland has failed to implement the 1991 Health and Safety Directive covering agency workers . #% It helped refocus governments ' attention on issues of racism , which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown . #% Following the conclusion of the prosecution case , General Moro , Chief of Staff of the Colombian Army , went on television to call for the men 's conviction , and this before the defence had even summed up . #% Today we are voting on a voluntary scheme which certifies companies to label their products as environmentally friendly . #% I raise it today but hasten to add that this is in no way a reflection on the qualities or capacity of the nominee Commissioner charged to deal with both of these issues in the current sphere of responsibilities . #% If they had produced what they were asked to this time , it would be the smallest piece of paper with the least written on it of anything produced because the intentions for investment in Western Europe in nuclear power are practically nil . #% This is a very urgent matter and deserves to be debated as a matter of urgency , because it is a threat to the free market . #% In Ireland , suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds . #% Let there be no ambiguity : the Irish people are a generous people . #% Principle number two is institutions that respect differences . #% Madam President , first I should like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Mr Simpson for a wonderful report based on common sense and pragmatism . #% I concur with Mr Collins . #% When we see the children killed in Qana , all justifications seem petty and shallow . #% It is the responsibility of governments to address that . #% This programme , I am sad to say , has been cut by the Council . #% Ireland 's entitlement is reduced from EUR 3.7 billion for 2000-2006 to EUR 901 million , which is a barometer of our economic success . #% It seems to me that if a vice-president of the ACP Joint Assembly and Mrs van Bladel , a vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and five members of the Portuguese Parliament are prevented from visiting Angola , there is something radically wrong in that region . #% Klaus , if I may call you that , you have added value to the presidency of this House . #% During this past year , several of the states in the Helsinki group have already in effect caught up with those in the earlier Luxembourg group . #% It should also aim to change negative public perceptions of the disease . #% The bottom line is that , if the common position on the dual legal base is maintained , this regulation will end up with a single Article 175 legal base after the ECJ has examined it and struck down the subordinate legal base , Article 95 . #% 
Let us support the bees . #% In the canton of Geneva , for example , there is a model contract which is automatically entered into by all employers and employees : it deals , inter alia , with issues such as the minimum wage , family allowances and holidays . #% This has to be taken into account . #% Secondly , on 19 October 2002 , the Irish people approved the provisions of the Treaty of Nice , which ensure that EU enlargement can take place within an agreed timeframe . #% Confusion , however , was spread at a great rate by the fundamentalists of the left , by the fundamentalists of the right , by the cranks in the middle ; and the truth was not properly sold . #% in writing . - I support this report on the future of credit rating agencies ( CRAs ) . #% I , too , want to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report on the Commission 's second annual report on the demographic situation in the European Union . #% The European Socialists are fully behind the leap forward which is possible given the cogent analysis that took place at the Lisbon Summit . #% If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU , small and medium businesses ( SMEs ) and consumers in all Member States would benefit . #% Is this latest concept the ideal instant quick-fix to help us overcome our difficulties or is it a Trojan Horse designed to undermine the drive towards an ultimate federal Union ? #% Again , I hope that , on the basis of sound scientific principle and with proper use of the precautionary principle , which is not a ` preventionary ' principle , we will be able to look after endangered species as we should . #% The tragic terrorist attacks in America last September highlighted the need for European Union Member States and our international partners to bolster cooperation to defeat the evils of international terrorism . #% Mr President , nothing justifies the use of terrorism . #% Mr President , on behalf of this House , I ask you to convey your sympathy and commiserations to the family of Mrs Jean McConville , whose remains were accidentally found in the last week or so . #% The only way we are going to get some sort of equality for women is when women actually occupy the key decision-making roles . #% The basic conclusion of the review conducted by the Commission was that the control programmes in the Member States were totally inadequate and in dire need of improvement . #% That is why I believe we have to be far more specific and look at the directive sector by sector , at the existing providers of services . #% Mr President , we all have a vested interest in this report , because none of us is getting any younger . #% So we recognised that there were benefits to be gained from the single market in the European Union other than just the amount of money that people got from the budget . #% On a separate but related matter , it is certainly the case that the working group on freedom , security and justice at the European Convention has brought forward some interesting proposals in this area . #% Following on from that , I know it may not be his exact role within this House , but he may be able to enlighten us as regards the Swedish difficulties that may arise with regard to ratification of the International Criminal Court . #% By not creating a first and second class category of membership we would also be sending a positive message to potential investors which is essential if these countries are to successfully meet the economic criteria for membership . #% These are matters that must be faced , they can not be swept away . #% I also support the rapporteur 's view that the directive should cover wood dust from all types of hardwood . #% On employment , I hope that the high-level working group which has just been set up to examine the question of financing the trans-European networks will report back as quickly as possible . #% What is it about the institutions of Europe - about the European Parliament , about the European Union collectively - that makes us unable to respond to the crises in the world as our people , our voters , our citizens would want us to do ? #% The European Union constructively facilitated the UN agreement breakthrough in Bali last December , with all parties now recognising the urgency of action . #% He also failed to mention or to give a view on the question whether there ought to be a moratorium on these weapons . #% Mr President , this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in Europe under the protection of the Working Time Directive , allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods . #% in writing . - The necessity for a comprehensive collection of data on investment in energy infrastructure within the EU is clear - an outline of the major trends occurring in the industry will be needed to allow for proper forward planning and to highlight any potential difficulties . #% Reaching our target of investing 3 % of our GDP on R&D by 2020 could mean a return of 3.7 million jobs and almost EUR 800 billion . #% The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the loyalist terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community . #% In particular I refer to Zimbabwe . #% Mr President , I extend my heartiest congratulations to Mrs Rothe for her exemplary work with colleagues in Parliament as well as with the Council and the Commission . #% The Commission has claimed that it is unnecessary for it to investigate the UK 's national implementation since it finds that the UK is compliant today . #% In my view we are not responding to these short-term difficulties . #% I am thinking particularly of my own country , Ireland . #% We were proud to do so then and I am proud today after your record in office of two and a half years . #% It seems to me therefore that it is something which the Commission and the Parliament should address . #% In the European Union we need to establish effective and binding regulatory arrangements to solve this problem sooner rather than later . #% Purists could never accuse it of being franglais , not that I would ever dare to offer such an insult to the members of the Académie . #% I strongly believe that consumers , once again , are going to be forced to bear the high cost of these licences . #% You can not prevent a failure by a single individual and it only takes one person not to follow those controls and the feeding of swill creates a real problem as seems to have been the case in the United Kingdom with foot-and-mouth . #% Preceding the downfall of the Roman Empire it was customary to take out the imperial decree , unroll the great scroll of purple and gold , read it , have it copied and distribute it - and nobody took the slightest notice of it . #% But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms . #% We have to ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve and whose fears we are trying to allay . #% I deeply regret that the People 's Republic of China has now carried out a nuclear test after the conclusion of the NPT Conference . #% The very name ` Irish Box ' I accept is emotive , but this is an issue in which we must have equity . #% Thirdly , on the evaluation by the Commission and the EIB : is the evaluation purely based on economic return from the work or is it to ensure that there is ground - breaking scientific work which may not have an immediate economic return but could potentially in five or ten years time ? #% With the availability of employment outside agriculture and the advances made by the EU and Member States in reducing unemployment , there is now a serious threat to the sustainability of Europe 's traditional family farm . #% Even if the investment were made , the outlay would not be justified in the long run , since the equipment would be lying idle for most of the year because not enough work would be available on a constant basis . #% That is the essential point I was making . #% For example , in Ireland 80 % of our packaging is imported . #% To return to the urgency of the humanitarian aid : rebuilding physical infrastructure is important , but it is understandable that agencies may be hesitant to rebuild when it looks as though an even more threatening regime is taking over in Israel . #% His proposals for reform were complemented by an equally thoughtful response from Parliament 's Agriculture Committee and I join the previous speaker in complimenting the Chairman of our committee . #% I will say no more , but I am disgusted - we must all be disgusted - at this savagery . #% As regards the proposals for agricultural spending in the coming year , I note that the preliminary draft budget adopted by the Commission leaves a margin of EUR 2.3 billion under the ceiling agreed by the financial perspective . #% Choices will have to be made about key policies which will have major long-term consequences for each of our countries . #% We thought that was what ESDP was , until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy . #% I welcome the appointment of Commissioner-designate Kuneva and Commissioner-designate Orban , and I hope that all colleagues within this Chamber will not use political points to try and attack them in the important role that they will undertake in the future . #% If we wish to hold on to an open and tolerant Europe , we must defeat these organized criminals . #% How much of the reduction of the capacity from Member States has gone over there and what impact is this having on the resources in that area ? #% The Irish navy has the responsibility of policing some 20 % of EU coastal waters . #% I can find no basis for the Commission 's optimism that farming incomes will increase except at the expense of a sharp decline in numbers . #% There are still a lot of important items on the agenda for completion by the end of your presidency . #% I had better clarify the first part of my answer . #% 
But even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility . #% The proposal on the African lion is scientifically weak and is strongly opposed by the range states where the lion population is stable or increasing . #% Our rail system has been improved in recent years but still requires further development in rolling stock . #% We want you to look at the possibility of involving credit card companies and Internet service providers in supporting the blacklisting of sites trading in illegal pornographic content . #% The emphasis on information dissemination in ALTENER II is very important indeed , and I look forward , if it is available yet , to looking at the Agores Centre on the Worldwide Web which is clearly intended to bring together all sorts of information on renewable energy so that everyone can look it up and can be kept up-to-date . #% I am not in a position to hand down rulings that might be better sought from the Court of Justice . #% Sinn Féin believes that the enlarged EU must adopt a new set of priorities . #% We have raised this matter in the Committee on Fisheries many times and the Commission says that this provision is redundant , that Article 10 in the new basic regulation allows Member States to enact stricter measures for their vessels . #% I welcome the fact that FIFA is going to use that tournament as an opportunity to crack down on racist acts at football matches in Europe . #% Do they not worry ? #% But there is a role here , and we need to do more work on that as a unique parliamentary contribution to the playing field in which executives can deliver the goods . #% I am glad to hear that he is alive and well . #% However , I would like it noted that we do not agree in full with the wording of paragraph 125 of the report . #% As I said , I would have liked to have seen stronger teeth here , but we need legally binding measures - which I believe we have - which will begin a process of really ensuring that we deal strongly with energy saving in the European Union . #% I believe that we must develop new ways of commercialisation and fully integrate coastal fishermen into the marketing process . #% There are no doubts these days that the creation of the European Union has been a very effective and successful peace process . #% The Presidency is independently preparing a comprehensive report on questions to be examined at the IGC and on the various options for resolving them . #% I believe you have succeeded in restoring an effective and substantial working relationship which is so necessary at the heart of a proper functioning Community method . #% It is for all the other programmes . #% I welcome this programme , but it should not exclude smaller innovative projects which are deserving of support . #% I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted . #% I agree with many of the proposed amendments and with the overall direction , but I have some concerns . #% in writing . - I fully support the re-election Mr Nikiforos Diamandouros to the office of European Ombudsman . #% The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive . #% As a politician , democratically accountable to my electorate , I am also not prepared to delegate my responsibility to unelected , unaccountable bodies . #% We are elected legislators . #% I am in total agreement with , and strongly support , the Commission 's view that there is no link between EMU participation and eligibility under the Cohesion Fund . #% Let us hope that this crisis is just for the short term , rather than the long term , and that we rebuild confidence and consumption . #% That is what happened in this case . #% When can we in Parliament expect to receive its draft proposals for a legislative framework ? #% It is particularly important to carry out this diplomatic and information activity with the so-called Group of 90 , comprising the ACP , the African Union and LDCs . #% We have got to look seriously at what we owe in the way of solidarity to those who could qualify but clearly choose politically to stay out . #% Mr President , I welcome this report by Mr Hutchinson on relocation in the context of regional development . #% Mr President , having seen over the years very difficult discussions in Parliament relating to this subject , it is indeed a pleasure for me this evening to see such widespread support for this report . #% It is therefore logical and beneficial to establish recognition of training given in third countries . #% It also accepted the definition of a passenger . #% I am confident that this Irish presidency will deliver on its priorities as it has consistently done in the past and give the lie to the myth that the small states can not effectively handle the assignment . #% We all have blood on our hands because of the slow international response to what has happened to date . #% However , like Mrs Schörling , I would hope that we do not get into a fight which would further delay us on the question of the legal basis . #% The goodwill is there to reach an agreement at the forthcoming European Council . #% What we have to do is release this new dynamic at individual level by saying the resources are there , even within the framework of sound finance . #% New ways to monitor fishing vessels could be used , such as electronic logbooks and the use of CCTV on the perimeter of fishing vessels , which has been piloted in Canada and New Zealand with some success . #% The report points out that at least 147 CIA-operated flights made stopovers in Irish airports including by aircraft involved in ` extraordinary renditions ' or kidnappings as we would normally call them . #% Transitional arrangements for Ireland must be adequate in terms of the level and duration of funding so as to address our continuing significant developmental needs . #% The single market has brought many benefits to our citizens , but it has also provided the criminals with just that - a single market for their activities . #% Would the Minister think that it might be a good idea to promote the development of the wool industry so that farmers would have a better income and perhaps would need less of the ECU 2 billion subsidization that we pay annually ? #% It is unbelievable that it wants its personnel to be free from prosecution if they are involved in human rights breaches . #% We need to be careful that we do not discriminate against large firms because we could seriously hinder efforts in building networks and linkages of large multinational companies into EU innovation systems . #% I am referring in particular to the young and long-term unemployed still concentrated in certain urban and rural areas of the European Union . #% If you are not going to invest capital in new machinery , in training , in new plant , in new equipment and so on , how do you expect to employ more people ? #% We need an initiative to enhance our credibility and to prove that Europe is capable of responding to economic and social crisis . #% I am calling on the European governments which will be represented in Bonn to use this conference as an opportunity to tell the US that this is not good enough , and that the full provisions of the Kyoto Agreement must be implemented : under the Agreement alone , the US Government would be required to cut emissions by approximately one-third by the year 2012 . #% We must also acknowledge that an EU defence policy must be underpinned by a coherent common foreign and security policy . #% Indeed in my own county of Meath we have problems with the quality of water there . #% If nobody knows what we are doing , except one or two in a very vast area and a number of countries , the value of the programme will be lost . #% They have a real problem servicing this debt . #% I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate . #% We must take some of them ourselves . #% As a basis for the basic law of what the European Union will be in the future , it is a very good document . #% I have already said we support as necessary the collegiate nature of the Commission . #% In Ireland we had a particular problem during the debate on the Lisbon Treaty since , whenever something negative arises , we tend to blame the European Union . #% The nature and timing of the arrests lead me to detect a cynical attempt by the authorities to spread fear in advance of the elections due to be held next year . #% The UN Convention against the illicit traffic of narcotic drugs prohibits the use , manufacture and distribution of ecstasy , LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld . #% It condemns all acts of violence and intimidation which are preventing civilians from leaving the conflict area . #% The jury is out . #% The fact that the Commission does not have to bring forward legislation to push this issue through is an indication that the way forward is by consultation between all the interested parties . #% 
We would welcome that . #% For almost all of the first half of this year - I do not have the dates on me now - I was accredited with not voting , despite the fact that I knew that I was here and voted . #% ` We are writing to express our disappointment about the content of the Declaration on the final text of the Fluorinated Gas Regulation made unilaterally by the Commission in the course of the European Parliament plenary session of 4 April 2006 . #% The recent case in Scotland which has re-endorsed the International Court ' s ruling that nuclear weapons are illegal is also interesting and has to be taken on board . #% If not , would you give an undertaking to look at it ? #% The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind . #% In other situations , I see the failure to pay levies whereby the national government , again , picks up the bill . #% We welcome the emphasis on looking for European added value , not scattering the limited funds over the whole range of research carried out . #% I welcome the Brussels Summit decision to allow the European Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate countries on all outstanding issues by early November . #% We need to look at the social and economic contribution we make to developing countries , and in relation to fishing agreements this leaves a lot to be desired . #% Mr President , I would like to commend the various rapporteurs and draftsmen on their excellent work on the 2003 budget . #% As you have mentioned yourself , this issue has been discussed a number of times within the Council . #% In terms of the standards and ethics expected of democratic parties I very much regret that in Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionist Party has seen fit to invite into its Stormont Assembly Party the political representative of the UVF , an illegal organisation which has been mired in racist , sectarian and other violence . #% People have whispered about this for years , but those of us who did not experience it listened with incredulity and , I have to add , a certain amount of disbelief . #% Mr President , I would like to support the point raised by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , the rapporteur , and I welcome the initiative proposed by the Commission to provide a basic instrument to fund and to promote organisations active in the field of equality between men and women at European level . #% Now the same principle must be applied to post-trading infrastructure . #% The Commission and Mr Cunha have both done very good jobs in analysing the results of the final year of the third multiannual guidance programme . #% The policy of withdrawing fish from the market and sometimes destroying it simply because the price is too low is totally unacceptable . #% I would like to see them . #% Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated . #% I regret , Commissioner , that you did not fulfil your task . #% A common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates . #% Finally , we remain concerned about the fight against fraud in the Union , an issue with serious potential to undermine the institutions . #% The people of Diego Garcia have been denied the right to live in their own homeland . #% In the current climate , it is right that we should do what we are proposing now . #% How , Commissioner , is that historic wrong to be righted ? #% The constitutional position in each Member State has to be taken into account . #% We look forward to working with her and we hope she will soon share , if she does not already , our enthusiasm for renewable energy . #% Indeed , such a directive is needed because the current European Union legislation does not provide for a Community mechanism governing the use of oil stocks . #% In the meantime , even as I direct constituents to the Ombudsman , I will continue to insist on a return of power to the people , which will lead to a real democracy . #% We have so many examples of that in life today . #% By just saying ` no ' he is just burying his head in the sand . #% We have until the end of 2002 for Nice to be ratified . #% I am convinced that we must go further in seeking international partners who will be pleased to find alternative options to the previous monopolies . #% I should like Commissioner Leon Brittan , when he sums up , to tell us whether he will undertake , on our behalf and on behalf of the Commission , to follow up the three points made to the Commission in the conclusions in my opinion and also in Mr Porto 's report . #% Cultural projects have a great potential in our Community framework - a potential not yet realised , unfortunately . #% Both committees have done excellent work . #% However , my firm conviction is that there is no such thing as safe nuclear power and that the stress tests taking place this year are a distraction from the real issue - the transition to a Europe powered by renewable energy . #% I would like to amend paragraph 5 of our text : ` welcomes the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES Appendix II ' . #% I believe it was a breach of his duty as a Commissioner to act in the interests of an individual businessman from his own country . #% It is very important , in my view , that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts , as a national can not and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State . #% Would the President-in-Office consider having a weekend across the European Union where similar sporting and cultural exchanges take place , so that we use sport to fight xenophobia ? #% While food production , using the European model and food security , are of paramount importance , this should not sideline the contribution of rural development . #% 80 % of all the stocks we know of are inside the 200-mile limit . #% Indeed we look forward to getting down to serious and immediate work on questions such as East Timor , south-eastern Europe and the Balkans in particular . #% In fact , a lot of positive things have come out of the European Council meeting that we should be promoting very strongly , in particular the commitments given to increasing employment opportunities and increasing the amount of money to be put into research and development ; assisting in the expansion of the lifelong learning and education and training programmes ; utilising the resources available to the European Investment Bank to kick start small and medium-sized enterprises , to give them an opportunity to create the jobs and to create the economic wealth and growth which is necessary within the European Union . #% Recommendations are just something that they comply with if it suits them , but not if they do not . #% As co-legislators in this area , we have a great responsibility to get things right and to ensure that the end result is one which brings about a fair deal for all . #% I will give you a very good example of that : in the 1994 to 1999 reforms the then Conservative government submitted a map to DG IV in the hope that those areas would then automatically be Objective 2 areas . #% Could you give us an indication tonight as to what you feel would be the best way forward to ensure the continuance of the school milk programme and how it might be altered at some stage in the future ? #% I welcome the fact that EU Environment Ministers have agreed to reduce the EU ' s emission of six greenhouse gases by 8 % between the years 2008 and 2012 . #% While I know that the original intention was and still is to bring Mr McCartney 's murderers to justice , that search for justice has influenced the political landscape in Northern Ireland . #% We were disappointed that we did not have some sort of minimum price fixing on imported salmon before the Christmas period . #% We have a big task ahead of us , but I would like to take this opportunity to remind all the signatories of the Hague convention that they signed up not just to protect their own nationals who may become victims of child abduction , but also to use the convention to assist those who are victims of child abduction by their own nationals . #% They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells , but Afghanistan is ignored . #% Denmark and other Nordic states are also concerned at the radioactive contamination of their seas and fishing grounds from reprocessing at Sellafield . #% We must realise that these stocks are endangered and we must protect the fishing industry . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the Taoiseach , the Tánaiste , Mr De Rossa and also Minister Mitchell and Irish civil servants for clearly demonstrating once and for all that a small nation can not only shoulder the responsibility of hosting the EU presidency but can discharge its task with great success . #% We must accept the difficulties that we are facing ; the scientific evidence is now overwhelming . #% If it is not the case , they must not treat the decision as an irrelevancy . #% So far a proposal has not come to the Council from the Commission . #% There is no suggestion to hand at yet , for example , that France or Britain is ready to hand over its independent nuclear deterrent to the WEU or to some new European defence organization . #% Under international law , it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations ; for example , conservation measures , safety and labour standards , etc. . #% We have to look at this and ask ourselves if it is morally correct . #% They were obviously monitoring the progress of this report through the committee , and I am pleased that they have rejected a proposal to allow unlimited quantities of herring into the Union , quantities of fresh , chilled and frozen herring at preferable rates of duty . #% The intention behind the postal directive was good but , like all good intentions , the application was not so good . #% 
The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach , in the medium term , a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus . #% This is a very fine judgment . #% America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together , as opposed to working against the interests of one another . #% Can I say that we fully understand the wish of the Commission and Council to ensure the success of the telecom package in advance of the Laeken Summit . #% Despite the fact that the EU will not join the Council of Europe ( CoE ) , accession to the convention should entail the right to nominate candidates for the post of judge , and allow for European Parliament representation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the CoE when this body elects judges to the European Court of Human Rights . #% However , the stark fact is that over 90 % of municipal waste is disposed of in landfill sites in my country , and four million tonnes of waste is produced each year in the continent of Europe . #% The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly . #% Mr President , the Lisbon process was important because it made a significant breakthrough by deciding to take an integrated approach to the economic employment and social policy dimensions to ensure that each was given an equal standing in terms of policy development . #% In most countries with abortion , and in those countries with euthanasia , people can now be exterminated simply because they are disabled . #% Distributions to investors and capital reductions will be limited in the first two years after takeover , and employees will have access to information on the plans envisioned for their companies . #% Mr President , in relation to the amendments , quite naturally I would support the thrust of the amendments which is the active decommissioning of all weapons held by terrorists on both sides of the divide . #% In December 1999 , DG SANCO proposed to allow the veterinary use of substances without MRLs in horses , provided records of treatment are kept and horses do not enter into the food chain before six months after use . #% I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world . #% EU money must not be wasted solely for the fulfilment of those obsessed with pushing their idealistic notions of a shared EU history or identity . #% In particular , I support the rapporteur where she asks that the Commission take into account state aid granted by the EU 's international competitors . #% This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concerns . #% Indeed , if you want to judge him on his record , then look at his record as Minister of Finance in Ireland concerning the social model , where health care was increased , pensions were increased and the highest minimum wage was introduced under his watch . #% What is happening in East Timor as regards the aid workers is unacceptable . #% I strongly support efforts to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion so that the new programme is not delayed any further . #% Mr President , I am delighted that the Amsterdam Treaty on the future of the European Union states that the new provisions on public health protection will be introduced with particular focus on committing the European Union to improving the level of human health . #% Mr President , Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon 's recent remark that he regrets not having killed Yasser Arafat in Lebanon in 1982 is unforgivable . #% Members who have just returned from Palestine say that the situation there is absolutely appalling . #% The negotiations on this deal were led by representatives of the dictatorial Mubarak regime which has been ousted by the revolutionary upheaval . #% Madam President , now that the dust has finally settled on this directive - possibly the most lobbied directive in my experience here in the last 13 years in Parliament - let us look at some of the issues that concerned not just us here in Parliament but specifically those who were quite bemused by the complexity of this directive in terms of public perception . #% I particularly draw attention to the emphasis his report places on the importance of economic growth as the best means to tackle excessive deficits . #% In the light of the failure of the Irish authorities to comply with EU directives , particularly in relation to waste , is there any possibility that the Commission might consider sending in an independent team to investigate the damage that is being done and the irregularities present in relation to waste in this area in particular ? #% In this regard , I would like to refute the criticisms that have been made here by Mrs Carlsson and others in relation to the report . #% We believe that murder is no solution to political conflict and that we must do everything we can to ensure a political settlement . #% We are glad that the excessive administrative costs have not been applied to inshore fishermen but , nevertheless , we welcome what has been done so far . #% Some countries want the rules governing the operation of the single currency regime to be opened up and made more flexible . #% This goes some way towards ensuring that in methods of investigation , for example , there is some sort of standard . #% When we see how our competitors behave - especially in the United States ' Farm Bill - one has to ask why we in Europe have to lie down on every occasion and roll over . #% I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , for his statement here today which is most welcome because of its optimism , its encouragement and which gives a clear demonstration of his determination . #% Finally , with regard to preventing countries in South America in particular finding it an economic necessity to grow the raw product of drugs , are any new proposals coming from the Council with regard to assisting those governments in South America ? #% Unemployment figures are as close as you will get to full employment in today 's Union . #% I would recommend the American model of repeat tests : a written test is taken every four years and a road test every eight years and skills must be kept up . #% As the Jacobites said after the Battle of the Boyne , `` Change kings and we will fight you over again '' , and I believe we will win the next time . #% First of all , the main reason why businesses relocate within the European Union is not simply because of structural funds or other incentives but maybe because people in those areas have the capacity to work harder and more efficiently and perhaps there is less tax to be paid in those Member States . #% By the way , Ireland also submitted its NAP on 13 July and you did not mention its name in the countries that you read out . #% The resolution rightly identifies the need to develop job opportunities outside agriculture in rural areas . #% Tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in the European Union . #% As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back . #% I believe that we must protect people as much as possible from the dangers of drugs . #% If stocks are to recover then the juveniles have to be allowed to mature and develop if the industry is to recover . #% Mr Wojciechowski has done his bit and he can not be blamed in any way for any delay . #% The rule of law Sinn Féin advocates , and the IRA enforces , is a brutal regime of terror , intimidation and violence . #% How much innovation do you think will occur if that lone programmer needs to contract a team of patent lawyers ? #% The economic crisis has serious consequences for women , who are at greater risk of poverty than men . #% The Commission has now adopted this idea , which I welcome , by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils which will include fishermen and their organisations for the very first time . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I served in the American Army in the 1950s , so I have a little knowledge of the horrors of war . #% In the specific case of the existing national measures in Denmark and Austria , against which the Commission has been considering legal action , a safeguard clause was introduced which would allow the two Member States to keep their legislation until 31 December 2012 . #% A recent survey of Irish consumers , for example , revealed that just one in five people has confidence in food imported from outside the European Union . #% I would like to say a special word of thanks and appreciation to Mr Santer for the magnificent work he has done for the European Union for the last four-and-a-half years . #% There is an obligation on manufacturers to bear the whole or a large part of the cost of implementing these measures and for them to take back end-of-life vehicles at no charge to the last owner . #% Secondly , the Commission maintains that it is not trying to harmonise tax rates , but how is it possible to separate the issue of tax base from the issue of tax rate ? #% My colleagues from Spain and Portugal have also referred to this . #% We tabled an amendment on how Member States get round the multiannual guidance programme by transferring their vessels to third countries and by using flags of convenience . #% In this respect , it is totally unacceptable that the Council has proposed an across-the-board reduction in agricultural spending in comparison with that which the Commission has proposed . #% However , without the stepping stone of Nice , much of that will be in vain . #% Edmund Burke , a great British parliamentarian , said : `` All that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good people do nothing '' . #% The slaughter of civilians in Afghanistan by NATO forces and by Western-supplied armaments in Pakistan , apart from being criminal in itself , can push some civilians into the arms of the reactionary groups . #% This attitude of risking the future of the fledgling democracies and emerging economies of central and eastern Europe has fed the eurosceptic vein in Ireland and is reflective of a government which would rather play short-term national political games for the sake of a few votes in an upcoming general election . #% The European Union started with two energy Treaties : the European Coal and Steel Community and the Euratom Treaty . #% In this regard , I would urge colleagues to support the plenary amendments tabled by my own group and other groups , which are very clear and simple , and to delete these elements . #% In the vote I would like to see the proposal to include beer extended to include cider also . #% These farms should be given a limited period to change this practice and find alternative methods . #% 
They have been taken together all the way through and I believe it would be more consistent to keep them together . #% I propose to stick completely to Parliament 's first reading and thus to say that we will reinstate - have reinstated - all amendments . #% As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached , it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures . #% It is quite clear that tobacco advertising has an appalling effect on young people in particular . #% Therefore , on that basis we do not wish it to be moved and will vote against it . #% The Commission proposals as they stand now , if implemented in their entirety , would have the following detrimental effects on Irish agriculture . #% We did not agree on everything but we have had a lot of discussion on the very interesting issues contained in both these pieces of legislation . #% Short-term financial assistance simply is not enough . #% The Irish Constitution is in fact silent on the matter , as indeed is Irish law . #% Regional legislation must be in keeping with the international laws in place nationally in Nigeria . #% I believe that this declaration sends a strong signal from this House to Member States and to accession countries to act to crack down on piracy . #% The Irish people are well capable of looking after themselves . #% We expect the same responsibility on the part of those who run our security forces not to abuse that right and not to abuse the tasks that we have given them . #% I believe the report makes a balanced attempt to answer that difficult political question . #% I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage . #% Why do we not use common sense ? #% I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand . #% Madam President , the common agricultural policy was to remain central to the medium - and long-term planning of European agriculture . #% If that is not the case I will communicate it to the Member . #% We welcome the proposals to assist regional competitiveness in former Objective 2 areas and we look forward to hearing more details on how this will be allocated and on the indicators used to identify those areas . #% Commissioner , given the announcement on Romania and Bulgaria , could you comment on the indications from the UK and Ireland that they will not be opening up their markets to workers from these two Member States ? #% If it is possible for Greenland , then it should also be possible for the ACP countries . #% That is good for the market , good for prices and will lead to a more orderly situation in which prices will be easier to maintain . #% I agree with this in the context of what I have just said . #% The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this . #% EU vessels fish hake and other species in waters off Morocco , and Morocco has no legal jurisdiction in these waters . #% The answer again is more or less what I expected , because we have been listening to it for a long time . #% It is quite clear that we are supposed to be striving to create an incentive where the animals will be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin . #% The international community has no option but to cooperate in helping these unfortunate people . #% There is a report in Irish newspapers today that the Commission is insisting that the rescue and aid package the Irish government will provide for Aer Lingus must be privately funded . #% author . - Madam President , as an international socialist , I strongly defend the right of each individual to freedom of religious belief and practice , on the basis that the fundamental rights of others are not transgressed . #% I would like the President-in-Office to continue to put pressure on the Commission to have the moral courage to stand up to this awful situation which is staring us all in the face . #% I believe consumers can see the benefit of choice and competition if they can be sure that if something goes wrong they can have a speedy remedy in a local court and they do not have to chase down a bad provider to Lisbon , Paris , Warsaw or London to have their rights recognised . #% It took determined international action to open the way for politics to reassert its primacy . #% I hope , Commissioner , that you will persevere with the philosophy behind the rational planning directive . #% It is important that safety criteria form the basis of the directive , rather than arbitrary recommended daily allowances which would be unnecessarily restrictive and not related to safety . #% The common position established the right for the last owner to return a vehicle to a treatment facility free of charge . #% In relation to Supplementary and Amending Budget Number 3 of this year , I would like to refer to an amendment which I tabled on behalf of my group , UEN , at the Budget Committee but which unfortunately was not accepted . #% We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future . #% That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass . #% I would also like to pay tribute to the former Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , who undertook groundbreaking work in establishing the Ombudsman 's office . #% But we need to protect the consumer from the cowboy operators , those who engage in sharp practice , and the rip-off merchants . #% However , the deadline being set down for the next intergovernmental conference is very ambitious indeed . #% No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America . #% We note with pleasure a marked improvement and look forward to reassurance about the safety of nuclear installations in the former Soviet Union . #% However , these bodies can not function without a clear Community-level policy and the necessary designated financial resources to underpin them . #% It would be undemocratic to deny those who have not yet ratified the opportunity to do so . #% Another thing that is exaggerated is the transfers of money . #% I would especially point out that the particularly vicious weaponry used in January has left many people with missing limbs and terrible burns . #% UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency should return to Iraq at the earliest opportunity and complete their mission . #% A second point on the timing : this Committee of Experts will make its report available - if I recall correctly - on 15 March . #% I agree with the views set out in the EU White Paper on growth , competitiveness and employment that biotechnology is one of the technologies which will determine the future of European competitiveness . #% I would like to turn now to Mr Linkohr . #% That does not mean that we want to bring an end to subsidisation . #% On Amendment 226 , which deals with a code of conduct on advertising of foods aimed at children , I voted against as I do not think this amendment is strong enough in its wording to get Member States to address the urgent concerns about increasing obesity levels in children . #% For the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe , the academic debate should be well and truly over . #% Thank you very much indeed and I regret very much that I am leaving this great Parliament . #% We have to change the way we do our business . #% In reality , we know that consumers are not encouraged to shop on the Internet outside their own Member State and that national consumer organisations - including in my own Member State - are not advising consumers to go down this route because it is fraught with difficulties . #% Your Commissioners are being tested on the same grounds . #% Unless we give real information in a very public manner then we can not benefit from these groupings . #% But the people in those camps would prefer to be re-settled back in their homelands and not have that money . #% There are divisions largely on questions of strategy and , in some cases , tactics . #% Understanding the nuances and repercussions of our decision is certainly not an easy task . #% Maybe it is too late tonight , but we would like an answer because you are negotiating , despite the fact that there is an agreement to ban tuna imports and this agreement is very much related to that . #% This opened the way for negotiations with the government to start once again , even though there is a wide gulf between the two sides . #% 
That too means we should come forward earlier , and not later . #% The other sad fact is that this Parliament does not really have the moral high ground to condemn nuclear tests after our failure on the whole issue of France 's nuclear tests and nor does the Commission because the Commission sat on its hands when it had the power to do something and it did not do anything ! #% There were children who were being bred specifically to be put into an institution from which they were subsequently sold to people coming into that country to buy babies . #% The European Council in Göteborg was generous in response to our predicament and I welcome its willingness to help the Irish Government find a way forward . #% My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended . #% In what way , then , will this directive lead to a competitive integrated services market ? #% There was also a problem in that we were unable to visit certain areas for security reasons . #% Mr President , the tragic events in America have sent severe economic shock waves through the world . #% That is a tragedy . #% One press agency reported that many papers could not recall a more useless and shallow example of posturing with no outcome . #% We are looking for better cooperation between the Court of Auditors , Parliament and the Commission in the implementation of European policies and more efficient spending of European money . #% For that reason , the Internet is a real headache for totalitarian dictators and governments , who go to great lengths to restrict and prevent its free use . #% The list is not exhaustive . #% The Commission must urgently review its approach to the aviation industry . #% We now have a situation where Members are standing up in this House to say that they are defending workers ' rights in Latvia as well as in Sweden , despite the fact that the only exact information we have is that Latvian workers have lost their jobs because of the actions of some Swedish governments and trade unions . #% Progress on this lies in the hands of the incoming administration in Turkey , not the EU . #% People are saying that this is the prophet of doom and gloom about to come and join us and take our power away . #% What are we building up for our children and grandchildren ? #% Anybody you speak to from the Palestinian area will tell you that it has always been the women and the children who have suffered most , but they have also been the most resilient in trying to find a way forward to challenge the failure to negotiate , the failure to respect and the failure to find a solution ; indeed , the failure of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments , to agreements that they voluntarily signed up to , the failure of the United States of America and the European Union to live up to their commitments with regard to clear and open negotiations , the failure of other states bordering Israel and Palestine to take a more proactive and positive role with regard to , ultimately , achieving a two-state solution , which must be based on viability and equality . #% I strongly believe that the United Nations must be called upon to play the central role in the political , economic and military transition in Iraq . #% It will be recommended to the producers of consumer goods to attach to their product a list giving at least one contact address in every Member State where the product is marketed . #% I would also sincerely thank him for the Berlin Resolution in this area . #% We have to live and earn a living in these places . #% The Commission praises our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging jobs . #% I fully support what he says . #% Firstly , the European Council should make the issue a top priority at its summit meeting later this month . #% I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a difficult subject . #% The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree . #% But , as a mother , I mostly beseech those with information on the thugs who perpetrated this act to come forward . #% On the MAGP , everybody admits that the EU fishing fleets are too large . #% It is spread most unfairly : EUR 17 000 per farmer to French farmers , EUR 3 000 per farmer to Portuguese and Greek farmers . #% Mr President , in many EU countries - including my own - a lot of work still needs to be done to restore full confidence in the blood transfusion and blood products services generally after a period of tragic lapses in safety . #% It has come as a horrible shock to learn of the decision to prevent people from standing for election . #% We have made a good few improvements : we have stronger rules for residue and we have better definitions of good agricultural practices . #% Furthermore , I believe it is of utmost importance that the region of AJK has proper representation in the Pakistani Government , which it does not yet have . #% Further , and more specifically , I welcome the amendments regarding the inclusion of alternative medicine in the programme . #% It is not only on the Internet that these things circulate . #% I fully support the rapporteur in his proposals that the measure should only be introduced on a temporary basis and that aid should be introduced to cushion the effects on the sectors which are most affected . #% Will the change in co-financing from 75 % to 50 % apply equally to EAGGF projects and those under ESF and ERDF ? #% Is this right and proper ? #% The two human rights concerns on which I wish to focus briefly are freedom of expression and the ongoing Kurdish issue , which needs a new approach . #% However , serious action is needed , and , to begin with , we need to examine what is known as ` demand-side ' management . #% Sixty per cent of the world 's population lives in rural areas and the vast majority are in developing countries . #% in writing . - I support this report which seeks to extend EU maternity leave to 20 weeks on full pay and to introduce two weeks of paid paternity leave . #% In the interests of all industries that rely on the coast we have to take action , and take it now . #% Too many diseases are included they say , when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis . #% This is the kind of politics that the people of Europe are crying out for and I would urge this House to insist that from tomorrow onwards all presidencies and all Commissioners meet with the standards set by Mr Juncker today . #% We note that this vote includes the creation of a budget item to provide supplementary funding to the High Flux Reactor ( HFR ) at Petten , Netherlands . #% Stability arises from the fact that such expenditure has hitherto derived from legally binding assurances and we must continue to give these assurances . #% When added to its cruel history and continuing persecution of Christians , it is clear that Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without . #% I am delighted to hear that new initiatives are being undertaken in this area , because it is a growing problem . #% We here in this House must express our concern for an enhancement of regional policy focus in those places because these regions will carry the most immediate consequence of enlargement . #% Two-thirds of flight hold-ups are due to congestion in the skies . #% This practice of social dumping is wholly unacceptable and the European Union has a responsibility to protect the rights of all workers , including seafarers who work European waters . #% I would like a response on that point . #% The issue was brought to a head at the end of 1999 with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing MRLs for established drugs . #% It seems extraordinary to me that we do not want to follow the countries that are economically successful at the moment , but want to bring in a tax system that is unsuccessful in other parts of Europe . #% Mr President , the Italians have an expression which I have always loved tutto il mondo e i paesi and today we are talking about a variety of legislation relating to what is clearly one of the most passionately debated and in many cases inadequately legislated for issue in our Community . #% Take a scientific , evidence-based approach and re-examine this proposal rather than - with respect - just dance , albeit belatedly , to the tune of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea . #% I think you agree , Madam President , that Parliament has not covered itself in glory with its tied result today . #% This is because the liberal regime in Ireland , the UK and the Netherlands is not acceptable to other Member States such as Germany and France . #% I am particularly pleased that the COOPENER Programme , which is itself modest , will serve as leverage for much better-funded programmes such as those foreseen in Johannesburg . #% I fully support the call in the report to link agriculture to the Europe 2020 strategy as I firmly believe that the agriculture and food sector can make a valuable contribution to future economic growth in Ireland and across Europe . #% I am pleased with the new mission of the JRC . #% There is great merit in the rapporteur 's suggestion that household catering waste be exempt from the provisions of these regulations with regard to transport , identification etc and that they be covered by national rules and the Framework Directive on Waste . #% This directive which streamlines the issue of civil liability in respect of accidents involving motor vehicles is a logical extension to directives which have been put in place over the last 13 years to complete the European Single Market . #% 
The European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution : the first half of the last century was the worst in the history of the world -- 50 million dead . #% On the issue of the amendment to Article 33 ( 1 ) , I am anxious to ensure that a Member State should not be able to levy more contributions on a pensioner who receives pensions from several Member States than if that pensioner were receiving all his pensions from just that Member State . #% It would be incorrect for any interest group to read any other interpretation into the text . #% The Commission will continue to cooperate and grant aid for various projects aimed at promoting human rights in Turkey . #% It is important to root out corruption , but we should be extremely cautious how we present this to our electorate . #% I want to share with you the view of a United Kingdom citizen living in the Netherlands who used the SOLVIT system . #% We must also , remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts . #% But there is no guarantee as to how this legislation will be used . #% Not only is the political situation becoming more unstable now in Iraq , but if we are not all collectively careful , the situation between Israel and Palestine could also deteriorate further . #% Many of the prisoners transferred in November 2005 from the European black site prisons are now in unknown black hole prisons elsewhere . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports . #% Mr President , there is no limit on the curiosity of scientists . #% Globally , aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing food sectors . #% Our position is very clear . #% In my area in the Irish Sea we now face , for the third year running , the closure of the fishing area for six weeks . #% I do not mean that everything here is not justified - but tell us the story . #% It is a deeply disturbing phenomenon in my own country . #% It is a legal obligation . #% I would like , on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group , to warmly congratulate the Finnish Presidency . #% That is an important act of solidarity , and an important point of departure . #% We want closer involvement by Europol in prosecuting cyber paedophiles and better cooperation between European law enforcement agencies . #% I know from experience in my area that many sheep farmers and suckler cow farmers are simply leaving the industry . #% This is essential to ensure safety , particularly in emergencies . #% Madam President , I would like to thank you and the Bureau for the swift action that you have taken in relation to this matter in inviting Patricia McKenna , as a Member of this House , to produce the evidence to substantiate the case that she alleged yesterday in an Irish newspaper . #% I agree with what Mrs Ludford said concerning the failure of the Irish presidency to be here today , which is an appalling message to send out to the European Community and indeed to the international community . #% When it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact on which EMU was founded , I trust that , under the revised and hopefully robust pact , the lack of even-handedness in chastising errant Member States will be a thing of the past . #% In the UK we also record programmes so that we are able to watch at the time and place we choose and that , of course , needs to remain intact . #% The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan , with 117 , which just beats Spain into first place . #% Affordable travel has enabled us to move around more freely for business and pleasure . #% What businessman in his right mind would keep two factories ? #% It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union , and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future . #% In particular how can entrepreneurs learn from mistakes and failures , and if they fail once , be encouraged to continue and learn from those mistakes ? #% Since the fall of the Taliban , drug production has increased tenfold , bringing misery and addiction to many and huge profits for the pushers . #% It is not a solution simply to put more traffic and freight on to our roads . #% They are one of the few remaining governing bodies anywhere in Europe where decisions are taken behind closed doors , and this must stop . #% What do you think such a draconian programme of cuts is going to do for trade , either in Europe or in the world ? #% I congratulate Joe Walsh and Brid Rogers for their great cooperation , which resulted in the worst of this outbreak being avoided in Ireland . #% From acorns grow oak trees . #% We should also look at the issue of , for example , blue whiting . #% That is something I never expected to see in my country . #% Unless we succeed in reaching a fair consensus on the level of financial support for sheep farming , this attempt at reform will fail and the decline of sheep production will lead to a significant imbalance in the European meat sector , thereby putting greater pressure on the beef sector as farmers switch from one enterprise to another . #% They agreed that the dual legal base , as proposed in the common position , should remain . #% The Geneva Conventions must be respected by all sides . #% I welcome the proposal to devote a quarter of the budget to the digital divide . #% If Mr Soulier 's paragraph 18 which says ` there is no alternative to nuclear power ' is passed , we will vote against his report . #% Fundamentalists often try to impose acceptance of their views through legislation . #% Commissioner , what has happened to the rational planning directive ? #% No directive has caused me more concern and more anguish in reaching my decision . #% Commissioner , in your strategy I want you to prioritise tackling the very disturbing growth in child pornography on the Internet . #% As someone has already pointed out in this debate , not all quarries that are extractive industries are the same . #% As rapporteur , I was very disappointed that we lost these legal framework amendments . #% in writing . - While academics will argue over the best possible way to measure progress , we as European legislatures must be confident in the method we pick and ensure that it stands up to argument both today and in the future . #% We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006 , and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct . #% I would like to stress that neither the fishing industry associations nor indeed any individual fishermen have approached me seeking to be included in the directive . #% Mr President , we all know that counterfeiting and product piracy has reached epidemic proportions . #% Mr President , this proposal by Mr Jarzembowski seeks to achieve two things : a uniform approach to what is a global problem , and also a solution to the conflict with the United States . #% We have given far too little attention to the transport sector and to the potential of cogeneration . #% However , further developments must be implemented if we are to combat the economic crisis effectively . #% Mr President , over the last month , serious momentum has been building up with regard to the process of EU enlargement and the fulfilment of our political vision in this respect . #% I wish you good health and Godspeed for the next two-and-a-half years . #% on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President , people who live with MS came to us in the Committee on Petitions to alert us to the discrepancies in treatment and opportunities for people with MS across the EU . #% Can the Commissioner therefore tonight give his support for the continuation of a strong role for European assistance post-2006 for our urban and industrial restructuring regions as well as our poorest regions ? #% Firstly , it is essential to the success of any programme that the people who provide the training - the experts , whether they be educational or vocational - should be included in the decision-making on the types of programmes to be involved . #% Our message , therefore , is that we are stepping up our action and closing down these sites . #% In the limited time that is available it is important that , as a number of speakers have already touched upon a number of disadvantaged groups or groups who are not doing so well in employment areas , we consider a number of aspects , the three most important ones being : equality of opportunity , equality of access and equality of training . #% We have all involved ourselves in this debate and something worthwhile will come from it . #% 
We also call for the safe repatriation under the Cambodia/Vietnam UNHCR agreement . #% I am extremely concerned about this issue , because once again Europe is trying to bring in and implement a draft regulation that tries to make one suit fit all . #% If we reduce VAT we do not improve competitiveness since there is VAT on the imported as well as the home-produced goods . #% Many scientists dispute this and recommend more research with adult stem cells to achieve the same results in curing diseases . #% I am intrigued by your answer in pretending that the British Government stands in favour of more transparency . #% Finally , given the well-publicised claim by members of your government that Ireland is closer to Boston than Berlin -- a claim from which I dissociate myself -- could you at least turn that now to an advantage with your plans to re-establish close transatlantic links given the rift that has ensued following the invasion of Iraq ? #% There have been too many incidents , too many scares and too many coincidences of health problems along Ireland 's eastern seaboard . #% The challenges facing us today are not about the distant future , or even the failed ideologies of the past . #% One has already been mentioned in the presidency document which has been given to Members : it is the fight against international crime and illicit drug-trafficking . #% I congratulate the rapporteur and look forward to the response of Parliament and the Council to the way they have badly treated this in relation to the decision they took yesterday . #% The way Question Time is run is not acceptable . #% author . - Thank you very much for your reply . #% Do you not think we could learn from the United States ' comprehensive approach to these problems ? #% I congratulate the Ombudsman in particular for succinctly identifying - perhaps one of the few to have done so at European level - the underlying reason for the failure of the Irish referendum and that is the gulf between rulers and ruled . #% While I agree with the general procedures that are being laid down in the Tillich report , I disagree with some of the concepts that are creeping in . #% In the twenty-five dark years of violence in Northern Ireland I would remind you that there was never an assault on , or the murder of , a journalist . #% Thus , issues far beyond the actual content of the petition have been raised . #% He is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule , if he should so wish . #% The US Government has avowed its intention to hand over the sovereignty of Iraq to a representative Iraqi Government at a very early date . #% Within hours of his resignation , the head of the World Food Programme in Iraq since January 1999 also resigned in protest at the sanctions . #% I know that the presidency has accepted that partnership is a key principle . #% Perhaps the timing was not right , maybe I should table this question again in June , so that he could outline even further what the Council should have done and account for its stewardship over a six-month period . #% A recent study shows that American male smokers lose 13 years of life to the habit of cigarette smoking and that woman smokers lose 14 and a half years of life from smoking . #% Another factor is the reserve of EUR 800 million . #% I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form . #% I voted for the joint resolution although there has not yet been ratification of the Nice Treaty in Ireland . #% A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States . #% The recent information about the falsification of documents just added to the deep sense of unease that is shared by people throughout our island . #% A notable case in Ireland recently has been the exposure of the Turkish multinational company Gama , which has deprived workers of earnings through paying substantially below the minimum wage and endangered their health and safety by requiring a substantial number of its workers to work up to 80 hours per week . #% I do not dismiss the malign role of Hizbollah in all of this , nor indeed -- as has not been mentioned so far -- the malign influence of the United States in encouraging Israel in its actions . #% Mr President , we welcome this proposal by the Commission to improve the system of control and I should like to thank Mr Casaca for his report . #% If you subscribe to one , you should support the other . #% Mr President , I must confess that when I first heard of the Ariane project , I thought ` What on earth are we talking about ? ' #% That in itself would be a test of how far countries are prepared to go . #% Secondly , we did a deal on the basis of 6 000 tonnes of tuna . #% South Africa is the major economic force in sub-Saharan Africa and the European Union is its principal trading partner . #% The Serbs must stop their incursions into Albania now . #% That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market . #% The first time it asked for this was only two weeks ago and , by that time , the international press had already pushed the alarm bells and the President finally had to admit that there was a catastrophe in the region . #% It allows us to have links with third countries such as the United States - why not - and also Russia and countries further afield such as South Africa and some of the applicant countries . #% The people of Pakistan , and even more so the religious minorities , are , at the present time , caught between the institutional bigotry of the Pakistani state and , in some regions , the ultra-reactionary and obscurantive forces of the Taliban . #% We should not be afraid of offending our EU partners by condemning their cooperation with tyranny . #% The whole issue is a reflection on the inability of this House to act . #% Scientists have claimed that water temperatures in the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have been as much as 3.6 degrees higher than normal this year . #% I am sure you can imagine , Commissioner , our astonishment and dismay when the Commission abandoned this programme in the year 2000 , cancelled a call for tenders already published , causing huge inconvenience , and proceeded to spend no money at all throughout the year 2000 . #% There is still time for this to be done . #% The Péry report on the crisis in the fisheries sector quite correctly points out that there are several problems that affect the industry , but surely the most important is the fact that there are too many boats chasing too few fish . #% I fundamentally disagree with Mrs Foster 's and her colleagues ' opposition to the idea of a European coastguard . #% I commend the rapporteur for his work on this technical subject and agree fully that an appropriate level of insurance cover should also meet the cost of legal proceedings . #% This is akin to Enron 's creative accounting . #% I do not think that Mr Robin Cook is pursuing an ethical foreign policy , as he promised . #% As a directly elected representative of the people , I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents . #% Could I also ask her as a matter of form to include in that package the need for proper consultation and communication between neighbouring States within the European Union , including the accession States , so that concerns can be discussed in a proper way , in a proper consultative forum . #% A very important aspect , perhaps sometimes overlooked by this Parliament , is the obligation to come to the table with a real negotiating position and not just take a stance for the cameras . #% It is not enough just to give financial assistance to young farmers because then all you do is put the price of lamb up out of reach . #% As well as reassuring consumers , it will also remove another weapon from the armoury of those who have reservations about enlargement going ahead as quickly as possible . #% We must maintain and increase food production within the European Union as part of our contribution to global food security . #% We believe that ab initio this kind of process , which , as I said , was a minority pursuit , to be a sign of weakness and not of strength . #% This will be another interim COP , COP 12-MOP 2 if you like , but it is very important , as this is the first meeting on sub-Saharan Africa . #% You would think that at the end of the 20th century we should be trying to get rid of these military blocs because they are not relevant , as far as I can see . #% I agree that the EU ´ s civil protection doctrine has to be founded on a ` bottom-up ' approach and that primary responsibility for civil protection activity should be with the Member States . #% This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU . #% Despite what people may say about advances in technology or the new safety measures that have been put in place , the risks associated with nuclear energy are so vast and so great . #% In the European Union we land something like 10 % of the world 's industrial catches , and it is sold for approximately 30 % of the value of fish that is caught for human consumption . #% Fortunately in Ireland we have succeeded in this respect : we are now above that average . #% I was pleased to support it . #% 
It is clear that any agreement will have far-reaching implications , not just for our future relationship with the Republic of South Africa but also with its neighbouring countries . #% Medical treatments are certainly improving ; however , they are not inexpensive and one year ' s treatment for HIV illnesses costs an average of between IEP 12 000 - 14 000 . #% As mentioned earlier , many organisations are eligible for this funding . #% Finally , I have not so far mentioned football , but I have to mention one aspect and that is that football is a game of two halves and even extra time . #% We must make realistic estimates of these costs and agree to provide the extra finance in the European budget . #% In addition , will he guarantee that this unit will provide the appropriate parliamentary committees with all the relevant information including analyses , recommendations and strategies on any potential crisis which should be monitored by this Parliament . #% The system is already generating angry criticism of farmers as the amounts of these payments are identified separately from the costs of products that farmers produce and are seem by some as handouts . #% Looking at what was voted through here in Parliament , we talked about research being subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State , but what if it turns out that a Member States does not have a legal framework in place ? #% Much remains to be done , but very substantial progress has been made . #% It is essential that we do not allow the European Commission to introduce a single instrument in such matters . #% I strongly support this political objective . #% I believe the onus is on the Turkish Government to ensure this happens . #% We need urgently to concentrate on the public health considerations and what the position is there . #% Many governments and many human rights organizations have called for his release and for the release of all political prisoners . #% The herring sector referred to by Mr Gallagher is worthy of special consideration at the moment . #% I would , however , like to salute the work the Commission has done this year and to acknowledge the enormous progress in the preparation of the launch of the euro ; the very substantial progress on enlargement which we very much welcome ; the work which is being done in south-eastern Europe ; the break-through on the World Trade Organisation and the very stimulating programme on sustainable development . #% Against this more open-minded background , I wish to make a few points . #% I am very pleased to concur with the suggestion put forward by the honourable Member . #% Furthermore , the Legal Affairs Committee ignored the advice of Parliament 's legal services that the legal base for this directive was correct . #% Figures from Interpol show that at the moment there are 60 children reported missing in the European Union and none of them have been traced . #% It is crucial to remember that all drivers , employed or self-employed , come under the 2006 driving time regulations which regulate their driving time , their break times and their rest periods . #% That peace has been shattered by renewed acts of terror intended to wreck the peace process . #% Trade relations must be based on the needs of the majority of the population , not the greed of tiny elites and corporations . #% Israel , a state that prides itself on its democratic credentials , launched with impunity a destructive war against a neighbouring , struggling secular democracy , destroying its infrastructure and killing its citizens , mostly innocent civilians . #% The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard . #% Also , Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks . #% We need openness and to know what is going on . #% I am asking the Commission to come forward now with a draft directive . #% It is particularly important for our new Member States , which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people , goods and services for so long . #% I hope that the presidency will have the opportunity to expedite the removal of the remaining difficulties , by bringing fully into play the role and opportunities available through Europol 's operational capabilities . #% Mr President , I am not absolutely convinced that the developed world needs free trade with the rest of the world in order to make economic progress . #% The decommissioning schemes put in place must ensure that the MAGP does not simply transfer the problem to other parts of the world . #% rapporteur . - Mr President , for the purposes of accuracy and updating the facts , as regards paragraph 94 , I propose through our oral amendment the addition of the words ` welcomes , however , the resumption of this aid from February 2007 ' . #% I think it is very important as a matter of public record that we should have a declaration in the clearest terms from the Commission in a body , that it is continuing to act as the essential European prime mover of enlargement . #% When we recognise the great need there will be to rebuild Iraq , we must also recognise the tremendous need to rebuild the relationship between the European Union and the United States . #% At the end of all this wasted expenditure , the French will still want to be French and the British will still want to be British , and no one but the political Euro-elite will prize citizenship of Europe above that of their own country . #% I believe we should concentrate our criticism , if criticism is needed , on those responsible : in other words , the political masters of the officials concerned . #% We must tread carefully on the matter of treaty reform for the simple reason that we have to guarantee that we can carry the support of the 340 million citizens in the EU for any such changes . #% Mr President , thank you for your courtesy in allowing me to ask a question . #% It causes dental fluorosis , damage to the tooth enamel , which is symptomatic of fluoride poisoning in childhood . #% In Europe alone , tobacco manufacturers spend a total of # 320 million a year on tobacco advertising . #% I refer , of course , to the death of George Best . #% We ought therefore in future to either provide the money and the conditions under which it is paid or cease to ask the Commission to give assistance . #% I endorse the recommendations in the report and I think the report clearly shows that cigarettes offer the fraudster a huge mark-up between the duty-free price and the actual sale price right throughout the European Union . #% What we do not need is irresponsible misinformation and scare tactics . #% If the House insists on maintaining the original date , President Santer will , instead , be at a European Council meeting . #% The Cologne , Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard . #% We are calling for a comprehensive tax base with regard to mineral oils , and if there are exclusions such as aviation gas or kerosene or natural gas , the Commission should justify these and explain their effect in terms of the operation of the internal market . #% We want to work with you as a reliable partner for Europe now and in the future and that requires respectful dialogue . #% It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva ; otherwise , no one will take us seriously . #% Our farm survey shows that the average family farm income fell by 5.8 % in 2002 to EUR 14 900 . #% The list of these countries is very long , but the traditional ones are Belize , Panama , Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines . #% I also support the targeted road safety aspect to this report , with a theory test for mopeds becoming compulsory from 2013 . #% Some months ago there was a move in this House to legalize cannabis . #% Mr President , I should just like to note for the record that this afternoon our colleague Mr James Moorhouse MEP joined the Liberal Democrats . #% After intense public pressure he actually agreed to modify the plant 's design . #% Those who would have us believe that in Northern Ireland we have the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other , do not accurately describe the situation . #% For me it is particularly unacceptable that in Ireland , which has recorded the highest economic growth rates in recent years , about 600 women are victims of breast cancer each year , and a sizeable number of those deaths could be prevented if periodic screening and diagnosis identified the problem early enough . #% I know we are all concerned about the matters raised by the honourable Member . #% Regarding the problems he raises such as the different standards of horse power , I have heard complaints by our own fishermen . #% It is not easy but it is essential and we are well placed because we have , to a limited extent , managed that . #% Today I raise this matter and put the British Government on notice that it can not hide the truth from the Finucane family or the European Parliament for much longer . #% This is more demanding than the standards required under the Nitrates Directive in the nitrate-vulnerable zones . #% There were shortcomings but our observations were that they were free and fair elections , despite the fact that there were segregated polling stations , and I was dismayed to see that there were separate counts taking place for women voters . #% For example , from an Irish perspective , I have some concerns relating to a number of issues . #% Mr President , I welcome the manner in which the representatives of the newly-elected UK Government have been received by the European Council . #% 
This is important because so many people travel not only across Europe but across the world . #% What has it been doing for the last 14 days ? #% We are still seeing pictures and videos of what happened and it is still hard for us to comprehend the massive scale of destruction and the loss of human life . #% I would like to welcome the Commission 's initiative to urge Member States to introduce best practice with regard to breast-cancer screening . #% The first course developed was a Diploma in Rural Development and Agri-Business . #% I am pleased to note that this week Minister Cowen , as President-in-Office , is making an official visit to the Middle East , where I am confident he will make every effort to move forward the peace process in that region . #% At present , the five larger Member States have two posts within the European Commission and there is one each for the smaller Member States . #% In the last election my own party had a slogan which stated : ' A lot done , more to do ' . #% I am satisfied that the compromise adopted by the Council involves an important role for the national regulatory authorities . #% The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop , but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as ` members as participants in the European Community delegation ' . #% We have decided , Mr President of the Commission , to turn your shield of collegiality into our sword of parliamentary accountability . #% With regard to aggregate MRLs , if , for example , there are two or three different pesticides , but they are all below the MRLs , the combination should say that they should not be on the market . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mrs Stauner , my colleague and good friend , for her report . #% I am also pleased to note that the Irish Government is most diligent in seeking clarification on the results of the bilateral meetings which took place at the end of the last presidency . #% When we vote on those my group will expect to hear from you a specific detailed and positive response before our final vote . #% Let us lower and enforce speed limits . #% This is an enforcement directive and one that can not write IP law . #% The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security . #% The consensus this morning amongst most groups shows that the Commissioner is quite right to take further the regulatory body that she has in mind and she has seen that there is a wish to have that strengthened . #% Events such as this will continue to recur unless and until we establish the `` polluter pays '' principle in the fullest sense of these words . #% Revenue generated by the Emissions Trading Scheme must contribute to the adaptation effort and the EU budget needs to reflect the urgency of coping with such challenges . #% The observatory in Lisbon can not work effectively without very close relationships with the Europol agency in The Hague . #% Mr President , this question of sustainability is indeed of great interest and the priority of the Swedish Presidency is welcome . #% Both countries already have strict legislation on f-gases in place -- since the 1970s in the case of Denmark -- and they view it as a key measure in their policy mix to achieve their Kyoto climate change targets . #% I compliment the rapporteur on his excellent report . #% There is a huge moral question about how we reject the rest , but take the best . #% If we must have ten new Member States , as we want to , and then perhaps Romania and Bulgaria as soon as possible and then Turkey in due course , then let us put the truth to the people that the Treaty of Nice must be accepted if that is to happen . #% I want to state yet again , here in this House , that I am a friend of Islam . #% I am really pleased with that . #% The guns are now hopefully permanently silent and the economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties of the south are beginning to realise their true economic potential . #% I broadly support her position , although I am not sure that I would like to replace the term ` market failure ' with ` market inefficiency ' . #% This represents over 45 % of the packaging waste on the Irish market , all of which would previously have gone to landfill . #% Before plenary , I contacted both Amnesty and Human Rights Watch again . #% This will weaken our voice if we attempt to raise it within the context of the UN Special Summit on Children next year , at which the issue of child soldiers will be a significant point . #% No Member State has fully met the requirements of the habitats directive , for example , let alone met them within the legally-binding timetable . #% A skilled and mobile young population is our greatest asset in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive . #% I had met representatives of the bread industry in Northern Ireland and was in doubt as to the intolerable and costly imposition which was involved . #% When it comes to environmental issues we need an international approach . #% During our visit we visited the Claremont coffee estate , where 50 families who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations , living in what can only be described as feudal conditions , were thrown off their farm because the owner , who happens to be the sister-in-law of the country 's president , decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing . #% I would encourage the minister to continue working towards a reassuring timetable in Göteborg . #% We are not combating global warming ; we are not dealing with the effects of the CO2 problem ; we are not researching and promoting renewable energy sufficiency and we are complacent on the issue of nuclear technology . #% I welcome this very good report and congratulate the rapporteur on producing it . #% He has served his sentence . #% The response has been positive , as the Commissioner knows from his contacts throughout Europe , including a recent visit to Cambridge . #% However , the ubiquitous Dr Rath - wherever he is , and I suspect he is in this House - has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through , making it very difficult for our services to block these e-mails . #% Mr President , this Parliament gave its views clearly during the reading on the Sixth Framework Programmes . #% How far can hazard analysis and critical control points -- HACCP -- be implemented in primary production on farms ? #% We in Ireland have recently witnessed the demise of the Irish sugar industry . #% Can I say that the European Union recognizes the need for further improvements and progress in the implementation of human rights and democratic freedoms in Turkey . #% It was clear that at the start of this year different governments in Europe had diverse viewpoints when it came to facing up to the growing political problem of Iraq . #% That responsibility must also be balanced with the rights of the authors and the creators of these works to ensure that their rights are protected . #% There must be no let-up in the efforts to eliminate older animals from suspect herds in the UK , herds known to have consumed infected feed and many of those cattle now incubating the disease . #% However , we must be mindful of encroaching too much on European citizens as there are obvious personal privacy issues with such technology . #% We want to leave personal responsibility to the individual . #% It is regrettable that the PPE-DE tried on a technical issue to get rid of this legislation with Amendment No 9 . #% If you want public acceptance - and many of you do - of the nuclear industry , you have to ensure that . #% I would therefore like to thank Members for all their individual contributions during the time I had the honour to be rapporteur . #% In this extremely serious and challenging context , what does the EU consider to be a priority ? #% It is they who have the right to expect that their interests are represented wholeheartedly . #% The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation 's mandate . #% Such an exemption should be granted to benefit UK meat producers in terms of cost reduction and alleviation from burdensome procedures by removing the need for separate batching at each stage of the production process . #% Whilst some new initiatives are mentioned , such as a data centre for natural resources , a high-level forum and an international panel , the proposed time horizon of 25 years is totally unacceptable . #% Regrettably , this has not happened and , clearly , no real single market in insurance exists at the present time . #% The Union itself must be prepared to take up the challenges posed by enlargement by improving its decision-making capacity and improving the functioning of its institutions . #% We succeeded in part the second time round in explaining the Treaty , but the lack of understanding of EU issues is still prevalent . #% Farming is a difficult life : long hours , hard work , high investment and many risks . #% 
I think we have reached an agreement with the Commission that information will be provided to us at intervals and in a form that allows us to monitor that spending in the way we want to . #% They exist all over Europe . #% In this vote , Labour Euro MPs have backed the hundreds of thousands of campaigners who are actively working for a Robin Hood Tax - a tiny tax on financial transactions that can raise billions to meet priorities at home and our commitments to fighting poverty and climate change internationally . #% Now we find that you have , maybe somewhat precipitately , made a unilateral offer to slice those tariffs by a further massive percentage . #% Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it is very appropriate that the European Union should engage in this political activity in order to make the point that we do not want to destroy but to support and maintain minority cultures and languages ? #% This Parliament , through the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Almeida Garrett report , pointed out that there was a need to amend that statute , because at the moment , Article 3 ( 2 ) imposes restrictions in terms of the Ombudsman 's investigative powers and , as it is currently worded , denies access to documents which can be refused on duly substantiated grounds of secrecy and accuracy . #% Islam , I have said many times , has in many ways been demonised , mostly by people who know nothing about it . #% At this very moment two shipments of nuclear fuel which were rejected by Japan because of the falsification of safety data by BNFL are approaching the shores of Europe , and will enter the narrow confines of the Irish Sea . #% The Irish Government will therefore be proposing a declaration in Seville on traditional Irish military neutrality , which I hope will be approved by other Member States . #% The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs . #% I think there is general agreement that significant progress has been made . #% This is the only practical way to administer treatment in the case of a disease outbreak in large units . #% This house and our colleagues in the European Council and Commission should begin to consider state funding to cover the proposed security costs , particularly in the event of a low passenger threshold not being passed . #% In the CAP reform farmers were forced to swap guaranteed prices for income aids and much reduced guarantees . #% She was the mother of six children and we were all able to give her the care and love she needed at the end of her life . #% We have seen too many treaties from the European Union in the recent past . #% I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency 's presentation here this afternoon as one that appears to be extremely constructive and pragmatic . #% If my memory is correct , he won three times in all . #% Transport takes almost half the energy cost and it uses almost half the oil . #% I shall end with this short quote . #% The right to petition helps to break down barriers and creates a vital link between the working of the EU institutions and our citizens . #% I might say that I associate myself entirely with the remarks made by my colleague , Mr Nicholson , and no doubt if Mr Hume were here he would be saying the same thing . #% Why are we being denied safer standards when they exist , given that , for example , American standards provide better protection ? #% As soon as we receive notice of any petition relating to the abduction of a child , generally a parental abduction , we telephone the parties concerned so that immediately they are aware that somebody in Parliament is directly responding to their concerns . #% We need to push for deeper involvement of national and transnational parliamentary assemblies in the works of the UN system , so as to strengthen its legitimacy and democratic nature . #% There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level , which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because , as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening , there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes . #% Madam President , I thank the Commissioner . #% I was at the Conference of Presidents meeting which took the decision that there was no substance to the allegations being presented , and that it was right that President Barroso should respond by letter . #% It is a very depressing feature of the availability of cheaper cigarettes that it encourages young people to smoke - and especially young females now who are beginning to smoke . #% With all due respect to the oratorical elegance and linguistic ability of the President of the Commission , and all of my colleagues within the groups here in Parliament , I would be useless speaking to a German audience with regard to what Europe does for them . #% The scheme categorises products and services that range from tissue paper to footwear to campsites . #% It simply passes around as it chooses . #% It is no coincidence that the euro has been fully accepted in my own country , Ireland . #% I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission 's opinion , to give to those charged to represent this House the widest , most thorough mandate possible to say : ` This is what is available ; this what we bring forward ; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament ' . #% It is totally unacceptable that vessels in the Mediterranean are exempt from the obligation to keep logs and declarations of catch in contrast to the requirements placed on vessels in other EU waters . #% Ireland was also a party to the resolution and I think we would need to put in an oral amendment , if this is agreeable , to include Ireland also . #% The fact that the United States and the European Union could not recently come to an agreement on the permitted level of future gas emissions is certainly an unwelcome development . #% In Ireland , where there is already existing legislation , the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is presently being updated to take into account some of the proposals contained in this directive . #% It is on an island and has its own docks . #% Neither the Commission nor the Council has covered itself in glory in the past on this issue but we have a more consistent approach now . #% The Intergovernmental Conference should address the job-creation and job-security issues by ensuring that the proposals for revising the Treaty include specific commitments to give increased priority to measures to improve the competitive position of EU industry in the international market . #% In the report , we stressed the importance of job consolidation and maintenance , just as we stressed the importance of job creation . #% The majority of farmers are in that network . #% Decisions will have to be taken at some stage in the short term , not in the long term , and such decisions will subsequently need to be properly implemented . #% I can not understand why blood from a remunerated source must necessarily be banned in Europe . #% There have also been major losses for Irish agriculture . #% Mr Cappato asks , ` When will the Council raise this issue with the competent US authorities ? ' #% It is now urgent that we cease reprocessing and that the high-level waste tanks be shifted to passive containment such as vitrification . #% Uneven opening of the market between countries brings huge resentment . #% There can be no neutrality when we are confronted with a brutal genocidal dictator such as Slobodan Milosevic . #% We are playing uphill on a very sloping playing field against the United States . #% This House has rejected that proposal again today . #% Let us represent the peace , the tolerance and the acceptance that the European Union should truly represent . #% Irish beef is known throughout Europe as a quality product . #% As we move to another year , let me thank the secretariat of the committee , the group staff and my own staff for their assistance in this report . #% We still see - and unfortunately this is at the heart of most of these cases - parents using their unfortunate children as weapons in the war between the sexes . #% In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like firstly to say that we welcome the Secchi report and we congratulate the rapporteur . #% The OSCE has substantially developed since the Moscow mechanism was agreed in 1991 . #% We expressed the same sympathy with the Greeks and requested the same assistance , but there is no money available . #% Ireland is facing the prospect of closure of its only processing plant . #% We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness . #% The van Velzen report emphasizes the importance of sustainability , which is not a strong enough focus of the Commission proposals . #% You yourself said that Monday was a historic occasion and that is true . #% Now we have a new travel agency coming in to takeover , maybe to save the Community a few pounds . #% I would go so far as to suggest that every household should receive a copy of the draft Treaty -- certainly every household that requests one . #% 
The Member States should make every effort to have this matter included in the Assembly 's agenda . #% This needs to be addressed . #% It is unacceptable to ask us to pass this legislation -- but we have no choice , because of the time frame -- without a proper and full impact analysis , as many colleagues have requested , particularly in relation to bans . #% Firstly , I should like put on the record of this House that the Treaty of Nice needs to be adopted by all existing Member States of the European Union to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union by ten countries , which we hope to see in the not too distant future . #% International cooperation is the bottom line . #% Today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it . #% No-one is highjacking the work of the committee . #% Last year , the Commission was actually trying to do something ; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers . #% I would certainly prefer if the references to manipulation and culpability were amended . #% Hopefully this Eurobarometer poll will be reflected when the Irish electorate next have an opportunity of making a decision on the issue . #% Our European leaders had the chance to make a just and credible offer of financing to the developing world to cover the costs of climate change , which is affecting their countries the most , but which is caused by us in the developed world . #% In my country , the Republic of Ireland , in eight days time , there is a referendum on the Treaty of Nice , unique among the 15 Member States . #% She correctly makes the point that the Commission communication does not comply with the requirements laid down in the Sixth Environmental Action Plan for concrete targets and timetables . #% A lot of people in my own country will be very put out that technically a lot of Members voted to increase their salaries by a huge amount . #% For instance , would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu , which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo ? #% Madam President , I apologise to you and to colleagues if by rising I test their patience , but since you have indulged some others , I should like to express a very brief view . #% One of the primary duties of the EU has to be to provide a secure source of food for its people . #% I do not share the rapporteur 's recommendations relating to the common agricultural policy and I can not support his suggestion to introduce co-financing of the CAP . #% Why have I had to waste half an hour here ? #% My Group supports the proposal and will vote against most of the amendments proposed , especially against those amendments that in our opinion send the wrong political signal by watering down the deficit criteria essential to a credible currency . #% Thank you for your reply , Commissioner . #% Mr President , I first wish to join with others in offering my sympathy to the people of South-East Asia who have been so badly affected by this awful tragedy . #% The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States . #% Mr President , it is a very great pleasure for me and my Irish UEN colleagues to welcome here the Taoiseach , Mr Ahern , our political party leader , as President-in-Office of the Council . #% I am picking up Mr Cushnahan 's question here because , unfortunately , he had to leave . #% What do the people say ? #% I have looked at some of the other programmes that we have funded before this , and there seems to be an indication that there is a much greater percentage of the funding going towards male workers that have been made redundant . #% If the Treaty of Nice is rejected by one Member State it is not valid law , because the proposed Treaty changes do not command the unanimous support of all the Member States . #% in writing . - Our European leaders failed yet again to break the deadlock in the negotiations for the conference in Copenhagen . #% What we are talking about here are immigrant workers , under-age workers , temporary workers , and so on . #% It is right and proper that we put in place the most stringent controls in the entire area of food production , right through from producer to consumer . #% It would otherwise have had a very distorting effect on the energy market across Europe . #% Mr President , Commissioner , can I first of all say I very much welcome this opportunity to follow the debate on this issue , but quite frankly I think it has tried our patience for a long time and most of us would like to see it resolved as soon as possible . #% Ironically , these fraudulent companies quote EU law in order to intimidate their targets further . #% Ireland is presently experiencing strong economic growth and part of our resources must be invested in alternative waste management schemes . #% Creating conditions for early Palestinian elections is a key to progress . #% Finally , we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile . #% The basis of this proposal is that the discovery of any TSE or the first incidence of BSE in a Member State would be covered by common rules which would take effect automatically . #% There has been almost a complete breakdown in the implementation of the roadmap for peace in the region . #% Secondly , the establishment of a relationship between financial compensation for fishing rights and payment for development is an improvement in the agreement . #% Independent and democratically-run trade unions and the right to strike should be campaigned for , as well as the release of all political prisoners and detained labour activists . #% It is a disgrace that large countries in the past have not foreseen the need to train , and countries like Germany and the United Kingdom should not be having to bring in workers from elsewhere . #% Coming , as it did , on the back of BSE in the United Kingdom , this disease wrecked the rural economy and destroyed many farmers in the UK . #% It is interesting to note that the differentiation in the banking sector 's involvement in film is not necessarily related to the country 's audiovisual output capacity . #% He is an example to other Ministers for European Affairs who come to this Parliament as regards how best to engage and obtain Parliament 's support . #% on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I wholeheartedly support this question to the Commission from each of the three committees on what I regard as a most important topic . #% Now the whole world - not simply America - is paying the price of these errors of judgement . #% The debate we have here today , which is very welcome , has been part of a long , difficult technical process . #% It now emerges that Member States who opt for this voluntary modulation can spend the money in any way they choose , without regard to the rules or indeed national cofinancing ; this is regrettable . #% These depend on where you are travelling to and from . #% However , we also need to prevent the dumping of CAP-supported goods outside the European Union , which drives down world prices at great cost to the developing world and effectively prevents the most needy farmers from accessing European markets . #% I am in favour of cutting costs related to the European Parliament . #% The provision for the current year is for a growth of around 8 % . #% DG ENVI 's strategy has been mainly restricted to knowledge-gathering and fails to address some key problematic sectors such as - unsurprisingly - agriculture , forestry , transport and many others . #% In voting for the Riis-Jorgensen report today I also fully support the much more imaginative environmental demands made in this report . #% From an Irish perspective , the Seville Summit was a most important one . #% Any European discussion on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI . #% It is a sad fact that the Dublin Foundation has found that over 15 million people have reported violence , sexual harassment or bullying in the workplace . #% The free movement of labour is one of the basic tenets on which the European Union relies and it is therefore up to us , the elected representatives of the European Union , to ensure that all our citizens have assess to affordable and speedy transport between the Member States of the Union . #% With the Irish economy doing so well we can not stand by and allow transport inefficiencies to become a limiting factor in that growth . #% Where it has been hit and miss , I have heard some very bad reports of the attitude of some people in the Commission in relation to annual action programmes . #% In fact the murder of the journalist Veronica Guerin in my country galvanised politicians and police into action which smashed a savage gangster culture in Ireland . #% I support their concern as it is generally believed that international criminals are now more interested in cigarette smuggling than drug-trafficking as it is more profitable and less dangerous . #% What is most amazing is the silence of the British Members of this House . #% Our government and the main political parties are telling us that the Amsterdam Treaty has nothing to do with defence . #% However , we were particularly angered by the imposition of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 1993 . #% 
The recent conflagration in the Balkans highlights the latent potential for destruction . #% The infrastructure , organisation and technology that are needed for a cleaner environment are all achievable because of the wealth and surpluses of the local economies . #% We must ensure that we do not leave the people of Europe to the likes of Mr Bonde and his ilk in other parts of Europe . #% Whilst this is a difficult time , and whilst there is a lot of uncertainty , this is also an opportunity for us to reflect on what we have achieved so far , and to find a proper and more appropriate way forward . #% I agree with Ms McKenna that so far the free sale of these products - which , I repeat , I do not regard as food supplements - has not caused any problem , and I see no reason to interfere with that sale . #% There are also considerable concerns regarding the intrusive nature of these images , and we must ensure that the privacy of European citizens is protected before we agree to the widespread distribution of these time-consuming and expensive machines . #% I am also pleased that the President-in-Office has recognised that the engine of growth in the economy are the SMEs providing 70 % of the jobs . #% The weakest and traditionally most vulnerable of our rural community , in terms of social welfare , and smaller farmers are being dealt with in the harshest and most unjust manner by our state . #% Yes , we have concerns about a few individuals but the responsibility for ensuring that none of them hit the headlines adversely over the next five years is yours , not ours , given the limited scope of the hearings in this Parliament . #% Through a rearrangement and a paring down of our present policies we can find the resources that are necessary to finance the enlargement of 100 million people . #% Like all Members of this House , I am conscious of the budgetary implications of reform . #% The 36 % , 45 % , 55 % proposals at World Trade talks , together with the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy - which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation - and the uncertain implications of enlargement , have created a climate of serious mistrust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven-year agreement . #% Mr President , I join in congratulating Mr Garot on his report . #% Fourthly , to try and anticipate , if that is possible , where we need to move in the future . #% He was Minister for Finance as Ireland ascended to wealth , and how did he choose to spend it ? #% A new equilibrium must be established on the basis of a true partnership in which both parties shape the agreed policy objectives . #% They must ` Show the red card to forced prostitution ' . #% I note with interest that the agenda for this debate which we are having today is headed `` follow-up to Nice '' . #% You can put in controls that will be so bureaucratic that they just will not work , so we have to concentrate on what is workable . #% Firstly , the ELDR Group in this House comes here in terms of a European vocation . #% I make no apology to anybody for the second principle which I think has to be present and that is the principle of social justice . #% It is time to move on . #% Perhaps it was the appalling vista of the potential effects of that explosion that caused so many governments and individuals to run for cover ; because they simply could not contemplate it . #% It is ten years since the NLD won a huge majority of seats in free and fair elections , but despite that , democracy has been suppressed from every angle and at every opportunity . #% The purpose of the Spring Council was clear at the outset : it was to be an economic forum , an opportunity to review the stage we had reached and also to chart out a new way for the future , in particular by looking again at the Lisbon strategy and establishing what alterations had to be made for us to continue to move towards that target . #% Today not only Irish but also Portuguese waters are under attack . #% The Court of Auditors report this week is a good example . #% If such an invitation is received , it will receive careful and favourable consideration . #% Parliament 's compromise shows the way forward and contains a substantial shift of money towards rural development . #% Sustainable fishing must be our guiding principal . #% The problem of trafficking has been identified by the Commission , and all Member States -- including my own country , Ireland -- need to play their part to stop this cruel and horrific trade in vulnerable human beings . #% It will be no surprise to anyone that the Greens will vote against this agreement , as we do with all third-country fisheries agreements . #% I would basically ask that OLAF , the EU anti-fraud agency , needs to be given increased resources . #% Clearly , 11 September virtually wiped out that business . #% All I can say about that is that it is an embarrassment ! #% The Council 's proposed ELVs could be met by primary means at a much lower cost . #% As far as the substance is concerned , we should remember that we live in a global economy , with strong competitors for agricultural trade . #% Farmers have been traumatised by the fall in their income so I hope that is the end of it . #% The report proposes a maximum budget increase of 2.3 % , keeping the increase below the EU rate of inflation . #% However , that does not mean in any way actively encouraging lesser controls . #% I believe that when dealing with many of the petitions , especially those relating to abduction of children , speed is of the essence . #% This is clearly going to be the route taken in future to circumvent legislation both here and in the United States . #% Since national governments control taxation policies , social welfare policies , working hours and rates of pay , obviously it is there that the greater part of the responsibility lies . #% It is now up to the Commission and Council , on the basis of the good faith we will show tomorrow , to keep their part of the bargain and bring forward a proposal in this regard . #% It is therefore our overwhelming duty in this House to decouple Europe from this institutional embarrassment at the earliest available date and the only means to do that is to take the available Commission - and I do not prejudge how the hearings may go - and do our utmost to make sure that it takes up office at the earliest available date . #% I have raised this question because representations have been made to me by an organization at European level that is interested in the wool industry . #% With the use of technologies like MRI and chemical screening , we now know that pornography alters children 's developing brains and stimulates the production of highly addictive brain chemicals . #% I wanted to ask a supplementary question but I am afraid that I am going to have to return to the two parts of my question which have not been addressed . #% While much more remains to be done in the field , this is an important step towards better regulation of the activities of alternative investment fund managers , which was met with opposition even after the 2008 financial crisis hit hard , most notably by Charlie McCreevy , the Internal Market commissioner in charge at the time . #% Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the statements they made before Parliament today . #% The costs of a cleaner environment and water supply are difficult to quantify , however . #% The exceptions which currently exist in Article 5 mean that the generous provisions on exceptions that we have in the UK will continue to help vulnerable users and ensure that schools , libraries and research and education institutions can benefit from private copying . #% It may not be the model which suits every Member State , but it has clear advantages in a small state where certain economies of scale are required in order to deliver the lowest cost and the most efficient production to end-users . #% One might also think that there would be a relationship between suicide and major economic factors such as unemployment and poverty levels . #% The package is , as the Commissioner said , a response to the European Parliament , which is in turn responding to the very real fears and concerns of European citizens , as is our duty -- my voice sounds rather similar to yours , Commissioner , I apologise : I too have a cold . #% Madam President , I listened with great interest to what Mr Santer and Mr Dini said to us here this morning . #% If there are to be problems - and sometimes there are problems - it will be around this whole question of the proposal to finance the shortfall in Category 4 with money from the agricultural section of the budget . #% Although it is a free vote , I will be recommending that we vote against , in the hope that a compromise will be found in that area . #% This would require the Commission to make a decision that compensation can be given for new processing methods without actually taking away the structure of the manufacturing capacity that is available for these alternative fuels in many Member States . #% That risk was heightened by the presence in two of those countries of very significant anti-EU minorities which , if they became majorities , could , under our present inadequate institutional arrangements , have stifled the very workings of the Communities . #% The fact that we have not been able to give it that priority in the Member States is certainly something that we all view with great concern . #% Visiting the peripheral regions of my own constituency which have traditionally depended on fishing , I have very little to offer them . #% Equally , I believe that the qualified majority voting procedure should not apply to decisions concerning the operation of legal systems within the European Union . #% It was clear at that time that unless these protocols were taken very seriously , we could end up with a rather dangerous situation . #% As Mrs Frahm mentioned in relation to registration , it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product , yet you can not trace a lethal weapon . #% Although this issue was not a subject for conciliation as no parliamentary amendment to the Council 's common position had been adopted , by bringing it into the conciliation process the Council violated Article 251 ( 4 ) of the EC Treaty . #% 
For any European strategy in this area to work , it is crucial that the various countries give priority to drawing up national action plans . #% In addition , the traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions and disasters that have occurred in EU waters points to the need for more effective coordination in avoiding potential maritime disasters . #% I believe that such an approach will encourage voluntary participation by women in the labour market and will hopefully close the gender gap as well . #% Colleagues , when you introduce moral issues into the process of money-making , it is never welcomed by those making money . #% In 1997 the common agriculture policy was worth # 5.1 billion to the Irish economy . #% I do not believe that there is a faith amongst people in the Member States that in fact what we rhetorically commit ourselves to we are prepared financially to commit ourselves to . #% Typically , these situations descend into scrambles of information from various sources and nobody knows whether they are going or coming . #% Within the highest safety standards , we must encourage and support research and ensure that the industry is not bogged down with so many restrictions that laboratories will move their research out of Europe altogether and cause a brain drain and loss of highly trained people and highly skilled jobs . #% We sincerely hope we will be given the opportunity of sharing in the executive powers - in a spirit of codecision , I might add . #% I would remind EFSA that many products , after years of so-called ` safety ' , have been taken off the market . #% The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules . #% Many of my colleagues have said to me - without anticipating the outcome of that work - that , should we ultimately need to review our framework in the light of any emerging trends in this regulation , the Commission President , Mr Prodi , should declare on the record , before the vote , that the Commission will be open to the idea of reviewing the document in the light of any evolving policy on transparency . #% Madam President , for too long Europe has been dominated by the politics of fear : fear of globalisation , of immigration and of a race to the bottom . #% You have tried hard to be factual in your report and that is appreciated but you must admit that , on the whole , your report is rather optimistic about the future of nuclear power in Western Europe . #% We must build up our resilience to the effects of climate change . #% He goes on to say that our defence industry is already at a serious competitive disadvantage , but the time has come for that industry to realise that it should move away from producing weapons that cause havoc around the world and start to produce something that will contribute to the betterment of society rather than to its destruction . #% What specific steps does he have in mind to safeguard against private entrepreneurs creaming off the easy and the profitable aspects of the postal services , whilst leaving rural residents as the poor relations ? #% In this regard I would hope that it will give due consideration to resolving a long-time existing environmental problem of major concern to your neighbours in Ireland - the problem of continued discharges of radioactive material into the Irish Sea from the Sellafield complex . #% I would ask the Members of this House to consider the case of the northern cod stock off Newfoundland which provided 200 000 tonnes of fish every year for five centuries . #% The proliferation of EU agencies in the field of health -- the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , the European Food Safety Authority and others -- is a very welcome and necessary development in tackling these health threats . #% In my country , it takes the Department of Agriculture five years from the time that you actually make an application until you are registered . #% However , while I agree with the general thrust of the compromise resolution , I would like to express my reservations regarding paragraphs 4 and 5 . #% This could turn out to be a Charter to waste energy , not save energy , and I would suggest to you that would be a very grave and dangerous outcome . #% The fact that 500 , 000 women are estimated to be being trafficked in the European Community is an appalling figure . #% While the Commission is correct to propose simplifying the rules of origin , I support the rapporteur in his view that all risks should not be borne by EU-based importers and furthermore , that the poorest countries should not be penalised in any reform . #% Finally , let us not forget astronomy and space exploration . #% We have to tackle the problem of space debris . #% To be condemned to death by stoning for having a child out of wedlock is a breach of internationally agreed human rights . #% I have been gratified to have the largest amount of votes cast for any person elected to this Parliament . #% This is an example of how Member States , having approved directives and transposed them , are failing to ensure that they are implemented . #% If half or one-third of what he wrote is true , then Sinn Féin / IRA has a serious problem about controlling what is happening in the communities it says it represents . #% BSE has unfortunately been with us for some considerable time and I suspect that we have to recognise that it will probably be with us for some years ahead . #% I do not question your right , Commissioner , to do what you did , but I question your judgment . #% For many workers - as you are aware , Commissioner - the picture is a dismal one , with unemployment increasing , working hours reduced , substantial pay cuts , the working poor you spoke of , and inadequate or non-existent training opportunities . #% They are always available and always very supportive . #% I highlighted to him last night , in the context of our discussion on Mr Miller 's report tonight , that when the issue of abolition of duty - and tax-free sales arose an excise question arose , namely where excise would be paid on sales etc. . #% This will ensure that bank and fund managers and insurers are able to operate on an EU-wide basis . #% Another leitmotif of the Fifth Framework Programme has to be sustainable development . #% Again , I am assured by the Commission that this matter is now being addressed , and it is likely that legal proceedings will be discontinued . #% We must focus on simplifying and establishing a supportive regulatory-environment framework which encourages entrepreneurship and reduces this bureaucracy and red tape . #% in writing . - The European Parliament can not give its consent to the introduction of body scanners , which are essentially a type of X-ray , before the existing health and privacy concerns surrounding them have been properly addressed by European authorities . #% Mr President , I would like to restrict my remarks to Mr Wuermeling 's report on consumer credit . #% In particular , the issue of sanctions to be imposed at an EU level flies totally in the face of subsidiarity and competences of national governments . #% But what do we see happening ? #% In January this year there was an unfortunate case where a man lost his life in this steel factory . #% At last the British Government has produced a fairly detailed programme for the eradication of BSE . #% on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - Madam President , I condemn the brutal repression by the Thai Government and State against the protestors in Bangkok and elsewhere in Thailand . #% People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working . #% This is a gross abuse of the freedom of the press and of the freedom to report what is going on . #% Do you anticipate that he will give direct reports to the relevant parliamentary committee on a regular basis ? #% I recognize that decisions have already been taken but labelling may well be only a short-term or , at least , a medium-term solution to the use of genetically modified products . #% We must be realistic about one particular situation . #% I welcome the fact that this regulation foresees five different ways in which an SE can be established . #% And it is ridiculous to speak about how we must do more at European level when at the same time you will not increase the budget that is available to the European Union to undertake this work , despite the fact that the numbers of people involved in the European Union and the number of countries involved in the European Union has increased . #% For years you , Commissioner McCreevy , as Irish Minister for Finance , refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland . #% This will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller Member States to have one Member of the Commission will be downgraded . #% There are clear public health risks involved in attracting the wrong type of donors through turning tissue procurement into a commercial activity . #% Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group , I wish warmly to congratulate our colleague John Hume on the recognition which has been given to him for his courage , consistency of analysis and on the way he has persevered politically and personally over many , long , trying years in Northern Ireland . #% The actions taken must guarantee compliance with data protection laws . #% What assurances can the European Central Bank give that these matters will be scrutinised with the utmost vigour and with appropriate sanctions ? #% Labelling must be accurate and checked to ensure consumer confidence . #% People in the Congo have not actually made these weapons : they have come from countries in the EU - including France , Belgium , the UK , etc. and elsewhere . #% I welcome the concentration on a select number of priority areas under the forthcoming programme . #% This would offer welcome assistance in their current plight . #% The only thing incineration does , as Mrs Evans has said , is to encourage the need for more waste . #% I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , for her work in producing this most important report after very extensive consultation . #% 
One of the extraordinary aspects of this issue is the fact that those outside the UK who purchased policies from Equitable Life did so believing that they had European Union protection and that the regulators in their own country would protect them . #% One final point : ten years after the initiation of the Ombudsman 's statute , there is clearly a need for a review . #% You will get a similar , Enron-style scandal as a result of all this . #% I also propose an additional amendment at this stage that sectors where this is systematic should potentially be subject to a Commission-approved block exemption or refund . #% I have to advise the Irish Government to pay careful attention to this space , where our freedom is threatened , and to defend it most vigorously . #% While I understand the argument that bona fide cloning experimentation may contribute to scientific advances which would alleviate human suffering , I must point out that there exists a loophole for the totally unacceptable usage of the human embryo at the stage of stem cells , cultures ` out of their natural environment ' . #% It is pathetic that the World Health Organisation and other countries cooperate with this embargo on Taiwan . #% No one can convince me that we have got it right at present . #% Ireland 's urban transport is in chaos . #% It is an unfortunate technical slip-up , but I accept it was an honest mistake . #% the secular nature of the state and its institutions #% The Committee 's proposal aims to improve the quality of the capital base , and extend and strengthen the coverage of the capital framework . #% This concession , which comes on top of the pain of CAP reform , involves sacrifice for Europe 's rural communities . #% Mr President , I made my point about the STOA report when we were discussing the order of business . #% A parent company must have effective means of exercising control over its subsidiaries . #% This initiative is yet another clear example of the European Union seeking to bring forward proposals which will help to promote and increase the standard of education within the European Union and beyond . #% Why do we not use our own initiative and not have the European Union hurting its own citizens while the rest of the world merely goes on its way destroying the environment ? #% We must not allow recent events to continue , or ferment or destroy us . #% Our Union must continue to play an active role in putting in place and consolidating a permanent peace agreement in the Middle East . #% Between 15 January and 25 January last , over 45 people were injured from bomb attacks alone , while ten people were killed during the same period . #% Mr President , the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq is to be very much welcomed . #% The fact that I did not comment on what the Swedish Prime Minister said does not mean that I agree with what he said . #% As a person with a disability , I have experienced both the best and the worst of treatment as a passenger , and should like to emphasise that , in most cases , the service providers try to achieve the maximum efficient service . #% It was particularly noticeable during the exchange of views with Ambassador Rutten and Secretary-General Schutterle of the Energy Charter Conference that instead of defending the difficulties the Union might have in implementing environmental and energy-saving provisions of the Energy Charter , they stated baldly that some Member States did not wish binding provisions for dealing with the environment in the Charter but took the view that these should be dealt with under a separate agreement . #% It is my belief that this aid programme continues to make a valuable contribution towards the promotion of the economic developments of the disadvantaged within South Africa and I hope that this programme will be continued after 1999 . #% However , one group has been completely forgotten -- the group that Hitler first attacked and continued to attack to the very end , in every concentration camp and in universities and hospitals throughout the Reich : the disabled . #% Let us hope when it is up and running that we will finally be able to produce films which people want to see , will enhance our bank of cultural products itself and also be films that other Europeans want to see and will go to . #% I would like to see the Commission push for fluoridation of drinking water throughout the EU to be discontinued until there is a proper , adequate assessment of the situation . #% For example , the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission . #% I am answering questions here as President-in-Office of the European Union Council of Ministers . #% While I certainly support many of the comments contained in the report on the Small Business Act , I was very disappointed that the report that emerged from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy contained a paragraph calling for a common consolidated corporate tax base . #% Who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first started that the numbers of people in employment in the European Union in the information technology sector would be as high as they are today ? #% Then , on the other hand , in its document the Commission makes no further reference to the NSRAC 's opinion . #% I know there are particular Irish and Finnish interests here , but I do not believe that we can accept peat as a forest-based industry . #% As far as radioactive waste is concerned , there is no agreed solution . #% This flight closes at 7.05 pm , so therefore Mr Martin was claiming that in 1 Hour and fifty minutes I would have plenty of time to collect my belongings and drive approximately 250 kilometres to Frankfurt airport . #% The way to persuade those consumers to take the plunge is to ensure that their rights are intact and this has to include , in my group ' s view , the right to take action in their own national court . #% The Commission needs to give an assurance that this proposed level of funding will meet the needs created by the higher levels of Community cofinancing , which can be as high as 50 % . #% Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mrs Jöns and Mr Hernández Mollar on their reports . #% Through successive anti-farming policies , we are seeing a dismantling of Irish family farming and , as a result , of our rural communities . #% However , it seems to me that what is intrinsic to this report is the point that social policy is intrinsic to a prosperous Europe and that it is not a question of one or the other , or of waiting for one to deliver the other : we must deliver both and we must find ways to do that through reform . #% It cheapens every one of us and our daughters . #% In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit , EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant , designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe . #% It is wrong and harmful to suggest that the government and farmers are indifferent to environmental protection . #% Thirdly , the European Commission 's proposal for corporate tax harmonisation is based on the assumption that harmful tax competition results in a shift in taxation away from taxes on mobile capital and towards taxes on comparatively immobile labour and that this development is harmful for employment and ordinary EU citizens . #% I put it to the Commissioners that one of the things they can do from a practical point of view , to generate pressure on national governments to act , would be to ensure that these guidelines are sent to each individual member of each national parliament in the European Union , rather than going to the secretariats of the national parliaments . #% The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union . #% No doubt we will revisit the subject after consultation with our national parliaments and citizens ' groups . #% You have all our good wishes . #% I am asking for a statement . #% There will be no verdict during our debate on anything that General Pinochet may or may not have done . #% I would add that the regulations that Europe imposes on its farmers are very strict and much more difficult than those imposed on food produced outside the Union and that should be taken into account as well . #% It is important to remember , however , that Articles 175 and 176 do not give Member States a free hand to introduce whatever measures they want . #% A European strategy must also seek to safeguard the existence of services that guarantee maximum possible coverage and equal conditions and treatment for all patients . #% Yet they are being prevented from doing so and in fact , those brave enough to do so have lost their lives . #% For many years landfill was seen as the easiest and least expensive option . #% I wish to say to Professor Prodi , if he uses his stubbornness in this Parliament as a reliable partner for Europe , that is the kind of stubbornness we welcome . #% This also has a serious affect on immigration policies within the Community . #% I am confident that once this is done the Irish people will vote for the Nice Treaty and embrace the fact that it is a necessary provision for the enlargement of the EU . #% In the Republic of Ireland we have been fortunate so far in that the outbreak has been confined to one area close to the border with Northern Ireland . #% I trust that this directive will assist in their achievement of that status . #% President , our hearts go out to the two radiation workers who were subjected to intense radiation poisoning and to the 300,000 people who were in terror as radiation levels skyrocketed . #% As regards the architecture profession , however , I would like to draw attention to the issue of Recital 21 . #% Irish politicians from the main political parties are now queuing up to score points on this issue , but they should be criticized for their unflinching enthusiasm for the single market in the past . #% in writing . - I voted to restrict the EP budget for 2012 , given the economic , financial and social constraints on EU Member States . #% I am particularly concerned here as a woman and a public representative of a small country that up to 30 years ago had prohibitions on women 's rights in many areas ; women were not even allowed to work once they got married . #% 
A major portion of that will be caused by the ageing of Europe , which will pose a particular challenge . #% The problem for BNFL is that the amount of high-level liquid waste produced by reprocessing continues to increase faster than it can deal with it . #% The Commission has very little control over how money is spent and has publicly admitted as much . #% I would refer him to the area near my place of birth , Trawsfynydd in North Wales . #% Many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat . #% Next , as many speakers have mentioned , there is a need to coordinate the broad economic policies with regard to employment strategy , to ensure that the two match . #% Equally vital components of successful tourism policy for an island nation such as Ireland are low-cost air and car-ferry links . #% Local job creation initiatives must be supported by national and European Member States . #% The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur , Mr Khanbhai . #% The fact that we have failed , and the Council has failed , to harmonise taxation , creates a situation in which motor vehicles cost a lot more in the first place , and this has some knock-on effect in the insurance sector , but it is not sufficient to explain it . #% We need an assurance from both the Commission and the Council that this will not happen . #% This discriminates against the very worthwhile organisations that need support at European level to make their voice heard and it undermines the appreciation of the high quality of their work . #% This evening we are dealing with a proposal for revising the monitoring mechanisms laid down in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the Kyoto Protocol . #% This is not an acceptable situation . #% Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe . #% Firstly , Amendment No 7 which would have explicitly respected human rights for all was rejected . #% It was right to impose sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Iraq ' s expulsion from Kuwait , but it is certainly not right to continue them in their present form . #% I especially welcome the fact that the United Kingdom will have its referendum and that the ordinary European citizens in the United Kingdom will not be robbed of their right to pass their judgement on this momentous decision . #% The Commission proposal would allow for the product to only be used in pre-packaged , clearly labelled combined meat products with the name of the enzyme , thrombin - a blood-derived product - in the list of ingredients . #% Taoiseach , there are those who contend that the only truly important issue to be tackled under the sixth Irish presidency of the European Union is that of the completion of the IGC , the issue of the Constitution . #% Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely . #% This is the last opportunity that I will have to thank Commissioner Byrne for all his help and great leadership over many crises over the last five years . #% Since I have lived all of my life in the countryside and have been actively involved in farming and the politics of farming , I fully sympathise with those farmers and their families who were devastated by the outbreak . #% I indicated that quite clearly , so it would be extremely unfair to discuss the Irish referendum and not to allow speakers to put both sides of the argument on this issue . #% We also recorded in the Minutes a declaration that our acceptance of the Commission 's proposal is on the basis that , at most , minimal tariff reductions will be applied to sensitive sectors , especially beef and butter . #% We really should take account of animal welfare . #% Mr President , there is great concern , and justifiably so , surrounding the extremely grave situation in the Middle East . #% The Commission has an opportunity to plan for a programme of substantial food aid and it should do so without delay . #% This also presents a considerable obstacle to developing common standards and comparative data protection . #% We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to avoid extreme language and extreme solutions . #% In some cases it set TACs at double , or even treble , the recommendations . #% What I find most disappointing is the Council 's attitude to this legislation . #% deputising for the author . - Mr President , firstly , I want to say that I am speaking on behalf of my colleague , Alain Cadec , who was to be the speaker here this afternoon . #% This core integrity is more important than massaging the nationalist egos of recalcitrant Member States who have been , and will continue to be , a barrier to progress . #% deputising for the author . - Given the fact that we live in an increasingly digital world , as you have acknowledged , where so much of our daily business is carried out online , one group that , in my view , has been left behind are older citizens , who have limited or no access to the Internet . #% Hence the country-of-origin principle , particularly in its original form in the proposed directive , is for me a bridge too far : it would be injurious to home-grown employment to permit service providers to operate in the host country of their choice without , unlike local providers , being subject to the same costly restraints in labour , consumer and environmental legislation . #% This requirement may well provide a useful opportunity for the authorities to identify the assets of criminals and to take appropriate action . #% The cease-fire announced by Islamic Jihad and Hamas has been called off and their leaderships have called for attacks on Israel . #% Perhaps we have given ourselves excessive competences over the years and taken on excessive responsibilities in areas where it was not all that fruitful and , indeed , could be an irritant to the citizens of the Union . #% Breast implant advertising specifically - indeed implant advertising of any kind - should be regulated . #% Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary surgery which may involve particular risks . #% The Irish government has stated its intention to hold a referendum on 31 May 2001 to ratify the International Criminal Court and to alter our constitution for that . #% As things now stand , neither side will stand back for long enough to allow these intense emotions to abate . #% Exposing the common agricultural budget to the vagaries of annual political battles in the European Parliament will wreak untold havoc on farm income and on the viability and competitivity of the European farm sector vis-à-vis the world market . #% It is going to irreversibly damage the people and the environment and it will not solve the drugs problem . #% Temperature rises have already been noted . #% The second green rate is for direct income support for farmers such as premium payments . #% Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world . #% I fail to see why Ireland 's transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully , more diplomatically , with more understanding - both by you , Commissioner , and indeed by our somewhat maverick , though genial , finance minister . #% How can we avoid the situation that , when they come under pressure in India , they move to China to carry on exactly the same trade ? #% It should be noted that the overuse and misuse of antibiotics is not confined to farmers and the agricultural industry : there is plenty of evidence that the medical profession does not have clean hands when it comes to over-prescription . #% Marker vaccines to distinguish vaccinated animals from animals carrying the virus will have a major role to play in this area in the future . #% If we want the next generation to be enthusiastic European as well as national citizens we must be prepared to put our money where our mouth is and invest in high-quality education . #% With this in mind , I welcome this report as it shows best practice from the European experience and we can see what that is applicable to in Sub-Saharan Africa . #% The rapporteur has done an excellent job in highlighting these and in showing how to avoid the mistakes of the past . #% Ironically , the United States , the world 's most fierce defender of intellectual property rights is now faced with the dilemma of needing huge supplies of antibiotics to combat anthrax . #% Therefore it is vitally important that we do everything we can to facilitate further growth within that sector . #% I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record . #% Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit . #% More work needs to be done in order to improve the Irish transport and environmental protection infrastructure and bring them up to European standards . #% Why is it that one euro was deducted from the minimum wage ? #% In this decade we have already lost 25 % of people engaged in agriculture and incomes have dropped by around 20 % . #% I want to begin by placing emphasis on the question of employment policy , in particular to focus on traded public services - as distinct from the public service in general - and the way in which in employment policy terms they are critical to the creation of sustainable jobs in the Union . #% However , it is true that in recent years the software and IT industries in the EU have been thriving under the current position . #% Mr President , I welcome these reports because protecting regional specialities is right and necessary . #% I fully respect the Commission 's right of initiative , but I would urge that the Commission should not simply start in February with a general statement of priorities and then , in November , bring forward a specific work programme . #% 
Yesterday I had a question down to the Commission and today I have a similar one to the Council . #% This we believe would create more legal uncertainty , more court cases , more money perhaps for lawyers , but that can not be in the interests of business or consumers . #% We have a terrible problem here because , as George Lyon said , there are 83 million eggs - we know that for a fact - which , on 1 January 2012 are going to be illegal . #% I think it is wrong that there should be a clash between Question Time and committee meetings . #% In conclusion , the provision for banking 2005 to 2007 surplus allowances into the 2008 to 2012 period effectively reduces the number of allowances available for allocation in that period and will act as a constraint on Member States in applying force majeure . #% I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work . #% If we ignore this fact we are burying our heads in the sand . #% The EU must act within the constraints and parameters of that reality . #% It is quite disgraceful that the European Union itself has not made its views known on this matter at this critical juncture for Mrs Radia Nasrawi . #% This report states that support for renewable energy projects must not be viewed as a straightforward subsidy under the state aid rules . #% I seriously question that point . #% I am pleased that the report emphasises that fishermen and other stakeholders need to take responsibility and ownership concerning any policy to eliminate discards . #% A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us . #% Mr President , Northern Ireland has a very vibrant poultry industry , which is expressing grave concern . #% True citizenship , however , does not need money thrown at it to make it real or desirable . #% It is incredibly important that the EU has participated in this process from the start and has played an active and constructive role in the drafting of the Agreement , as the fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy . #% Fair play is all we ask . #% Of course , this summit was spun in the media as a success when , in truth , we got nothing but waffle . #% Regrettably , the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness . #% Mr President , I would simply like to place on the record the political view of the Liberal Group . #% When dealing with this type of legislation , we have to be mindful of its impact upon pilot fatigue . #% The financial support that has been given , for example to the partnerships , was the very first time that we saw Republicans and Loyalists sitting down together and working at grass-roots level . #% It is a delicate time , whilst an appeal is going on , to be raising what are emotive issues and I understand how difficult it is for you , Commissioner , to give a full outline of what action the Commission would take in future if the death penalty were to be imposed . #% Even though the overall reduction in working hours may be postponed for some time , the actual rest-period times and so on come into force immediately . #% This is a view which I believe is shared by the vast majority of the Irish people . #% There seems to be a complete contradiction : we are sending people to stop the fighting in places where the weapons used originate in the countries of origin of the so-called ` fighting preventers ' . #% The question really is : can we best advance our influence in the sphere of human rights by continuing to conduct the sort of relations we have with Turkey as we do at present and the judgment has been that we can . #% In terms of agricultural policy , for example , abolishing all market support and protection would remove about two-thirds of EU farmers from the land . #% Perhaps if she concentrated more on the documents , rather than speaking in a language that no one cares to understand , she might not have made such a fundamental mistake . #% It is both welcome and reassuring that from the very outset the new Commissioner , Mr Byrne , has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to restoring consumer confidence in the food industry . #% As Mr Stevenson has said , they are going to suffer endless hardship . #% This is a major issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Commission . #% In particular , I am glad that at all times they fully respected the role of Parliament and its Members . #% While the Commission may not have been proactive enough to date in using its infringement powers , I hope that its recent case against Denmark will be a sign of things to come and will assuage the worst case scenario fears of industry with regard to the single market . #% The facts are inescapable . #% Where errors are identified these mainly relate to weaknesses in internal control systems both in the Member States and in the Commission . #% Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe . #% Accordingly , it is fitting that the passing of such a sporting colossus should be noted in this international parliament . #% At the moment , it is the continent most affected by AIDS . #% In this regard , we deplore the continued failure of the Council to deliver the financial protocol for Turkey , and ask today how the presidency proposes to unblock this unhappy situation . #% It can not , therefore , be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights . #% The tragic death of these eight people , including four children , found in the freight container just highlights the daily plight of many asylum-seekers and refugees throughout the European Union . #% There is no safe way . #% The modification to the regulation seeks to permit and extend this possibility targeting low income households in all Member States . #% Mr President , ten speeches ago our committee chairman , Mr Wynn , said that everything that was important had been said . #% In this context , I am hopeful that improved broadband access will help stimulate small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas . #% The common fisheries policy has not worked for Ireland . #% I commend the report to the House . #% Surely the way forward is the closest possible cooperation between the European nations , not the incorporation of those nations in a European superstate . #% If we fail these defenceless people , then our foreign policy aspirations are a failure . #% New buildings continue to be erected on the settlements in and around Jerusalem and the prospects for the roadmap appear dim unless action is taken in the immediate future . #% This year , we have a very different report , in style and in content . #% In the last decade , brain-imaging technology has backed up those observations , demonstrating that there is a definite shift in the child 's brain that allows him or her to internalise the primary care-giver , usually the mother , so that she is available to the child in active memory even when she is not present . #% I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed . #% We have not allowed enterprise in Europe to unlock itself and to deliver the goods . #% The number of air miles involved in transporting the products is also a consumer concern . #% This is all ludicrous and it is completely unacceptable that animals are tortured for this sort of excuse . #% KIMO International has since expanded this project to harbours in the UK , Sweden and Denmark , with EU financial assistance . #% Furthermore we should seek balanced agreements with our partners in developing countries where we are fishing at present and combine this with expansion in aquaculture , thereby protecting their fishing resources and providing new sources of production within the EU . #% We have to reinstate Parliament 's original position and the original Commission proposal . #% However , it is a notoriously difficult area to enforce because of outside conditions , such as bad weather , that will affect the way fishermen operate . #% Similarly when prices on the world markets are higher than they are in the European Union , as has happened thankfully recently , we save ourselves that cost and the money is retained in the budget and we can use it for something else . #% This measure will only exacerbate problems in the aviation sector . #% The only question I have about the Giansily report is paragraph 5 , which talks about importing products without any cost to the European budget or disruption to European markets . #% I believe we must now decide as a matter of urgency to put procedures in place to ensure that industries can not move simply to take advantage of less stringent controls and , if they do move , that they do not adopt anticompetitive practices to stop somebody else taking their place . #% The result of their consensual approach has been to strengthen and unify the voice of the European Parliament on the key issue at stake . #% 
We should enshrine fundamental rights for all citizens of the Union in the Treaty : the right to a decent income , health care , education , housing , work , training , welfare services , community and family life . #% Ecofin 's report to Florence on what I would characterize as the non-implementation of the 1995 guidelines , following hard on the heels of the non-implementation of the 1994 guidelines , is a ritualistic , bland and passive document in the face of this pathetic factual record . #% When we -- as we inevitably do -- experience shortfalls in services , we solve the problem by hiring people from other countries . #% Enlargement to welcome ten new States and tens of millions of new European citizens into the EU is both a bold gesture and the accomplishment of our true European destiny . #% On the same report about these reforms we heard the President of Guyana , the chairman of the Jamaican sugar industry and the chairman of the Mozambique sugar industry saying what a disaster these reforms would be for those countries . #% Let us not be caught in this position again . #% If not , then it will have to relocate to a place where it can do so and be more efficient . #% But will we be back here in a year , or in five years , or are we are last going to deliver on donor commitments to a poor country that simply can not be left on its knees any longer ? #% But if I am a dark-haired , brown-eyed , dark-skinned southern European , I could spend six or seven hours in the sunshine to no effect at all . #% Satellite systems are a very small but positive step , but a lot more needs to be done . #% It is not equal treatment when one organisation can receive funding without needing to make a proposal to the Commission , and yet other organisations must compete against many other worthwhile proposals . #% It has to be said in fairness that the former Commission led by Jacques Santer was as much a victim as an author of this process . #% I would ask that you , Mr President , and this House give full support for the release of the three captives and that you raise this immediately with the Council and the Commission to gain their support . #% I am pleased with your response , but could I urge you through the Agricultural presidency to make contact with the Commission to ensure that the request is put on the agenda so that it can be dealt with during the Irish presidency . #% In order to make the most of the industry 's unique selling point - the high quality of its output - we need further promotion as pointed out in the Scottà report . #% Mr President , first of all on the technical measures . #% Minister Roche and , indeed , the Taoiseach , have my wholehearted support in rising to the difficult task ahead of them in the months leading up to enlargement and the European elections . #% Mr President , the new directive calls for a uniform , transparent and flexible regime for the recognition of professional qualifications in order to facilitate the free movement of qualified persons within the enlarged European Union . #% The honourable Member will appreciate that ongoing discussions are taking place aimed at achieving a common position . #% On the de Brémond d'Ars report , we voted against that report because it is , in effect , going to hinder completely the possibility of liberalizing the postal service , which is not in the interests of the consumer and not in the interests of the internal market . #% We should not abandon vast areas of our countries , where human activity will fade away . #% It seems to me that the biggest sin we have committed in our country is to reward the people with tax cuts and increases in salary . #% Mr President , the most striking statistic I have heard tonight is the one from the Commissioner when she indicated that it would take 2 500 years for us to reach a position of equality for women if we continue at the same pace . #% I know there is a lot of rubbish but there are some very good ideas . #% I would like to encourage the Commissioner in her work in this area , but of course the reality is that in inner-city areas it is the voluntary sector , the community groups which are taking the strain of the government 's lack of commitment to urban areas . #% The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate . #% These journalists were covering social justice and environmental issues . #% Charter flights are subject to great delays . #% GMOs are the new challenge facing us . #% As Mr Dini said , we in the European Parliament are in the best position to reflect the concerns of our citizens . #% Well , the record of the Irish presidency during the last six months and in particular during the Dublin Summit , like the previous Irish presidency , demonstrates clearly that smaller Member States can organize efficient and successful presidencies and in many cases can broker agreements which larger Member States are unable to achieve during their presidencies . #% No matter how much Mr Prodi protests , he and his college are seriously flawed . #% Through good practices of coastal zone management , we should work towards sustainable management of the coastal zone . #% Monitoring is very important . #% What the Indonesian authorities are doing there has to be challenged . #% It is time that the government came to grips with any remaining industrial relations problems in this area so that the ill-gotten gains of the drug dealers can be targeted . #% I would ask you to consider very carefully how we proceed here , particularly as we are not in a position to have a debate . #% Equally , it will ensure that the common agricultural policy will be properly financed and that many social and regional aid schemes will continue for the poorer Member States of the Union after 1999 . #% To conclude , there really is a need for some joined-up thinking in this area . #% The Union has given considerable political and practical support to this process over the years and I very much hope that the British presidency will ensure that the important developments of recent weeks are given due consideration in Cardiff . #% It is the first country in its region to sign an association agreement with the EU . #% Trains loaded with spent nuclear fuel from three nuclear plants in the south-east of England regularly cross London bound for the BNFL plant at Sellafield . #% So I am doubly disappointed to hear you say , Commissioner , that it will be mid-February before you can come up with your new evaluation . #% This can only be achieved by recognizing that agriculture will continue to play the pivotal role in rural areas for the foreseeable future and that structural policy should be geared towards the maximizing the development of allied sectors such as agri-tourism , food processing and the preservation of environmentally sensitive areas . #% Unfortunately we have not yet ratified the Aarhus Convention in my own country , the Republic of Ireland , unlike most of our neighbours in the EU . #% Tonight , while I welcome the Commission 's presentation of Agenda 2000 , I remain to be convinced in relation to certain aspects of the budget implications . #% Mistakes have been made in dealing with this evolving problem by successive governments . #% The issue here is that basically these are overseas territories of the EU . #% As the Commissioner is aware , the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement , estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion , and that is why we are tabling this question today : defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets . #% I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time , rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest . #% It is , therefore , essential to secure an efficient and effective taxation system and efficient and effective social insurance system . #% Mr Moscovici , Commissioner Patten , I also would like to be associated with the words of welcome to our honoured guests , Mr Ahmed Qurie and Mr Avraham Burg . #% Perhaps you could give me your view as to whether that should be included in your future strategy on alcohol and the problems related to it . #% There is little point in the farmers in the United Kingdom diversifying into organic production only to be undermined by products from South America coming in at a lower cost . #% Madam President , the views of the 370 million citizens of the European Union on the food chain in Europe have dramatically changed in recent years . #% It is the fifth fuel - coal , gas , renewables , nuclear - the fifth fuel , with a 30 % potential , is energy efficiency . #% Any attempt to sully the reputation of the IFI is totally unacceptable and amounts to ill-informed political bandwagoning on the sensitivities of Northern Ireland and are not worthy of this Parliament . #% We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water . #% The adoption of a directive on accident and investigation in November 1994 was the first EU response to the use of these new powers . #% Mr Santer might like to reassure us that the concerns of older workers will be taken into account in his deliberations in Luxembourg . #% I understand that Commissioner Van Miert has already signed an agreement with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies on making sure that these two maps are indeed coherent , and I wonder when you will refer that document to Parliament . #% I hope that tomorrow Parliament will rectify matters by overturning the rejection of the framework directive proposal by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . #% In Ireland we have signed a bilateral agreement with Romania and Nigeria and we are planning to sign more such agreements in the future so that we can speed up the procedure of deportation . #% We are not in danger of creating a precedent : this case is unique . #% The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans . #% It is important that all Member States take this on board . #% 
That is the sort of thing we have to look at if we are going to get rid of corruption . #% I welcome our President-in-Office here this afternoon . #% The main export sectors that will be affected include pharmaceuticals , ICT , medical devices , dairy and other food products . #% The economic and social situations of the EU ' s peripheral and island regions vary considerably . #% This marks a fundamental democratic deficit at European level and in the wider international context . #% This report , prepared by the Director of the US-based Institute for Research and Security Studies , accuses the United Kingdom nuclear installation inspectors of not taking a serious accident at Sellafield seriously enough and of not having an emergency plan . #% Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union , where we lag behind the United States . #% Mr President , I should just like to endorse what other people have said about giving the Sakharov Prize to Mr Gusmão . #% Are we talking about Hiroshima , Nagasaki , Cambodia , or even Korea , where I served in the American Army ? #% I urge the Irish Government to enable the survivors to remain in Ireland , to help them rebuild their lives , and to provide them with refugee status if that is appropriate . #% Such an environment does not cultivate consumer confidence , domestic demand or domestic growth . #% Now , that is a gross distortion of the treaties which are neutral as regards where aid or money should come from to assist the aviation industry . #% Further debate on these topics will be led by the presidency which will seek to build on the experience and expertise gained to date and will try to construct a common approach to social exclusion and poverty . #% Regrettably , in many parts of the world , but also in Northern Ireland , the lawyers and judges have found themselves in the front line where the trouble is most intense and the murder of Rosemary Nelson brings home to us once again the danger that many of these professionals put themselves into when defending one of their clients ' most basic human rights . #% The promotion of re-use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery . #% That response includes a number of specific actions that the Fund is taking to address matters raised in the report . #% Harm reduction is the thin edge of the wedge leading to legalisation . #% Such is the level of fear and intimidation of the witnesses that the code of silence surrounding the event has still not been broken , nearly four months after Robert McCartney 's death . #% Too few people may be receiving too much money as the whole industry becomes restructured , and some very big producers get the compensation foreseen in the reorganised policy . #% I take that to be your perestroika , to match the glasnost which you refer to , but not an everlasting reform , not a constant state of flux . #% The programme has four objectives , all of which are indeed intelligent : the promotion of renewable energy sources , of energy efficiency , of clean transport and of all these three things in developing countries . #% I am pleased to see that in Amendment 14 , along with other vulnerable groups , women with disabilities were specifically mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to violence . #% Our European institutions must be courageous and provide leadership on the rights and needs of our children and young people . #% In my own country we have been reassured over and over again that the European Union is not being militarised , yet many reports which have gone through this Parliament in the five years I have been here clearly indicate that is the direction it is going in . #% With such a dreaded virus one is somewhat reluctant to talk about success , other than to say thankfully Ireland 's quick response , sometimes regarded as extreme , has so far been successful in containing the disease to one outbreak . #% However , there are some questions which remain unresolved and these issues should be viewed in a new context following the prolonged closure of European airspace . #% Whether in Britain or in any other Member State , I think it is clearly a matter for those Member States to ensure that does not happen . #% on behalf of the PPE Group . - Madam President , can I thank both the Council and Commission for a very clear statement of their intent on this very crucial issue of rising food prices . #% I likewise request that all further ratifications stop . #% Mr President , this report concerns the proposed adoption by the European Union of the United States ' energy star programme as it applies to office and communication technology equipment . #% Mr President , I suppose it is true to say that a lot of what needs to be said has already been said in this debate but I think it is important that as many people as possible should participate in this debate . #% This is not just my view : the litany of management blunders and serious technical defects is a matter of public record , which has been exposed , despite efforts to keep it secret . #% We questioned Commissioners Liikanen , Lamy and Busquin and we went to the hearings of de Palacio , Patten and Wallström . #% We know what the barriers are to accepting such a common sense solution . #% Our group voted against the arms industry resolution because using more funds and resources to promote the arms industry in Europe goes against what the European Union should be about . #% In the Union 's message to the Serbian people last September the foreign minister said that the Union promised that a vote for democracy in Serbia would be a vote for Serbia in Europe . #% Europe 's society can not continue to tolerate that and to pursue policies that are clearly failing . #% I too tabled amendments to abolish the 16-week rule . #% It must strive harder to fulfil its obligations in that regard . #% It is a good and useful thing that we can talk , because I do now accept the need for Article 186 to be brought into place so that we can get this money direct to the producers as fast as we possibly can . #% The success of the single European currency was brought about by careful , consistent planning which is now going to bring economic benefits to the 290 million people in the eleven participating countries . #% Physical degradation of housing stock denies its occupants the right to decent living conditions and is a major obstacle to integration and social cohesion . #% This is an economic issue - ensuring that pupils , when they enter the labour market , are capable of participating in it . #% The Left 's resolution also points out that illegal logging is related to poverty levels in the countries concerned . #% When we have completed the process of enlargement , we will be economically and politically more powerful . #% The Commission proposals concerning the development of food legislation and food safety are positive . #% He , like myself , has been given the great problem of trying to deal with a highly technical report and trying to find a way through . #% But , also , when we speak about harmonisation of taxation or harmonisation of the minimum wage , this obviously militates against creating equality , because countries that at present have lower wages and a high level of social protection could be made uncompetitive , with business and companies being attracted elsewhere and jobs lost . #% But unfortunately , with the quota management system under the common fisheries policy , it is exactly what we have : first - and second-class fishermen . #% Indeed , I am of the view that the transatlantic relationship has not yet adapted fully to the new set of circumstances which exist following the collapse of the Iron Curtain , the effective removal of a security threat to Europe from the East and the emergence of the United States as the world 's only superpower . #% We must show that we are earnest in calling for the repeal of those most foul actions and that we are against the denial of the most basic human right - the right to life . #% The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland , when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland , said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future . #% The Euratom Treaty is one of the founding Treaties of the Union , along with the Treaty of Rome . #% It is much better for the international community to invest in peace now rather than having to spend money later picking up the pieces caused by continued conflict and violence . #% We have an obligation to be serious about our contribution to the future development of the Union and our ambitions for a better way forward have got to meet the expectations of all the citizens of the European Union . #% I want to warn against that because we in the Committee on Budgetary Control used to see ourselves as working with the Commission for the improvement of the management of our resources . #% We must always strive to achieve the maximum potential of Europe 's agri-food industry . #% As a result , 66 % of the visible Maltese import and export business is done with EU states . #% I would urge you , Mr President , to show some flexibility and to allow the House to vote on the request by Mrs Müller . #% EU fleets are already active in many oceans around the world and often cause considerable damage . #% He would have been leading for the PSE Group in this debate otherwise . #% Without proper pre-treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water , as well as polluting the air . #% The violence , murder , human suffering and instability in the Balkan regions , which have been taking place over the last 10 years , must now be put behind us . #% Unfortunately , society has discriminated against women for centuries and the only way we are going to move forward is if we put in place some sort of structure that ensures that women actually get into decision-making and into the workforce . #% The Irish aquaculture sector , for example , now accounts for over 30 % of total fish production , reflecting global trends . #% In a recent poll in England , 71 % were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council . #% 
The euro can be the icing on the cake of sound economic management , but no amount of propaganda or spin can ever sell it on its own . #% Many of these prisoners are the very people who are responsible for organized crime , murdering and terrorizing elderly people in their own homes . #% Mr President , I welcome Mr Blair and thank him for staying for the entire debate here this morning . #% We will be faced with this even more now because of our recent enlargement and the reunification of Europe . #% I would very much like to welcome Commissioner Wallström 's comments . #% I do not like the back door . #% It is important for us to accept that there are moments of crisis , sorrow and strain in all of our lives and that when we experience them we may need support and we may need understanding , but we do not always need a diagnosis and a drug . #% We must engage with all of our citizens and seek to integrate them . #% No update has taken place . #% They skipped bail -- partly put up , it is said , by the Dublin Government -- and now , on the back of a sordid deal with the IRA , and despite Interpol warrants for the three men , they are brazenly flaunting themselves in Dublin . #% The Greek Government has worked very closely with all the representatives on the EU Convention and this has contributed in ensuring a new draft Treaty that will pave the way for new structures within the Union . #% Everybody has problems in the European Union of one type or the other and no-one should try to make or take advantage of the other 's problem . #% I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her contributions , not just today , but over the period of the Finnish Presidency of the European Union . #% In the eyes of the Timorese he is the Nelson Mandela of East Timor . #% This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country . #% I hope we can continue down that path despite the one or two problems that are there . #% But moral issues matter to those people that we represent . #% I welcome the operation of the Financial Services Action Plan . #% Those doctors -- a consultant oncologist and a paediatrician -- who sacrificed their whole careers for their courageous action , have been in Ireland for over a year in an overcrowded hostel with no certainty that they will not be sent back to persecution and death . #% We have all seen surveys that show that air traffic is going to increase in the coming years . #% This helper could not lift , could not put his hand above his head , could not in fact do anything that a carer had to do . #% So I very much hope that the administration in Strasbourg will ensure that we do not have to go through that again . #% This resolution quite correctly calls for the abolition of the Internal Security Act and any other laws that permit detention without trial . #% We need a more independent investigation process . #% Over the coming months we must approach these negotiations with firm determination so that an agreement can be secured on a text for the final Treaty , which hopefully would govern the operation of the Union for the next 50 years . #% However , there is a lack of engagement with the European Union and often a lack of trust about where they see the European Union going . #% In a review of the water fluoridation policy by the Irish Government a few years ago , 90 % of the public submissions called for an end to this mass-medication . #% In my opinion , the Commission 's approach to this whole problem is a negation of its responsibility on conservation and sustainability of stocks and a recipe for conflict . #% In light of these considerations , I believe the EU must exercise extreme caution in embracing the biotechnology industry without the outmost care and precautions being in place . #% There is no possible justification for this deliberate attack on the livelihood of European steel workers . #% With regard to the issue of terrorism , it has been correctly emphasised here that intelligence is the key to defeating terrorism . #% It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection . #% They can now put their words into action . #% However , this is a most appalling case and should be followed more closely than his reply seemed to suggest , because there are other similar cases and similar convictions in Nigeria and elsewhere . #% Young farmers face enormous problems such as the massive financial burden when they start up and often this can be compounded by difficulties associated with inheritance . #% We must look at that particular aspect of legislation . #% If their mandate is changed to support team-based projects , this must not be to the detriment of supporting individuals of excellence . #% I think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in Ireland . #% I know Members would wish to discuss the issue , even if not to decide on it . #% Have provisions in respect of nuclear installations which affect the territory of another Member State , particularly in regard to any cumulative effect of hazards to the health and environment of neighbouring populations , been agreed ? #% The issue regarding the Baltic concerns the adoption of a closed season for salmon . #% Could you confirm this and , indeed , could Parliament ' s presidency confirm that there is no problem with asbestosis which , of course , would be in breach of our own EU directive passed over a decade ago . #% The fact that accidents in different countries can now be dealt with in the country of the injured person is a huge plus , and I congratulate the rapporteur once again . #% Finally , I would also remind the Commission that there exists no mandate to negotiate away the current export refund regime . #% Following on from what you have said , President-in-Office , on the division of labour -- some countries are obviously more able to provide logistical support than others -- I would like to ask whether there is any coordination as regards who can best implement the various facets of the operations , or is that still a matter for bilateral relations between Member States ? #% Certain countries need to apply rules differently : if , for example , a country is an island , or does not have a population to support a large , functioning market , it needs to use every advantage at its disposal to attract investment . #% We would like to have codecision , we would like to propose our own performance reserve , but that is not our job . #% We urgently need the framework directive , not a Green Paper . #% Member States throughout the European Union are seeking agreement on policing throughout Europe and the Europol Convention . #% In widening the European Union rather than deepening it and in making it more democratic and diversified rather than more bureaucratic and centralized lies the best way forward for all the people of Europe . #% In landfill sites which are geared to non-toxic waste , there will be a loophole to allow toxic waste to be added , depending on what kind of justification is given . #% The only Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms which can be utilised in the Member State courts or even in the Court of Justice , as authoritative rather than binding , is the European Convention on Human Rights which is a Council of Europe document . #% For my country , Ireland , food exports and in particular beef are of paramount importance to our economy and the income of farmers . #% It is important to explain to EU citizens that they can only enjoy free trade and the benefits that it brings if they are prepared to have a body to enforce discipline and fairness . #% What Britain is seeking to do at present is effectively to rig the market in its own favour . #% Studies estimate , frighteningly , that by 2020 neuro-psychiatric disorders , with depression at the top of the list , will be the highest-ranking cause of illness in the developed world . #% I would also like to thank Mr Hughes for his efforts . #% I appeal to you to bear in mind that you represent Europe , not Portugal . #% Mr President , the key point that Mr Andersson made in his contribution tonight is the need to get the social and financial concerns in balance . #% Genetic modification by itself is not harmful and it is wrong for us to confuse the public by suggesting that it is . #% It is disgraceful that the affluent West has now added trade in human flesh to its consumer excesses . #% We need rigorous enforcement of all legislation so any complaints can be dealt with quickly . #% I should like to place on the record how pleased we are to have a new member today who signs on our behalf . #% If that is indeed so , then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send . #% I am also very pleased with the new wording in relation to the protection of the anonymity of the donor . #% I hope that the fund continues to treat , and will be seen to treat , all sides fairly . #% 
There is no place for dissidents in this new regime and those found in breach must be strongly disciplined . #% I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution . #% It is also clear that industrial fish catches contain an unknown quantity of edible and even valuable fish . #% It is the ethos in my own country , and I would like to encourage it . #% The threatened withholding of the entire single farm payment is wholly disproportionate and potentially ruinous for many . #% Commissioner Mandelson 's decision to impose anti-dumping duties on certain synthetic fabrics is welcome so far as it goes , but often such fabrics are then further processed in China to give them added value , thereby avoiding the anti-dumping duties . #% Commissioner , that was a very long , quite technical answer . #% However , it is true that a more balanced approach is needed . #% There are in fact so many people who are long-term unemployed , who are living in difficult housing conditions , who are not being retrained for employment and who do not have educational opportunities . #% They have failed miserably in their responsibility to protect public health . #% It argues that a better understanding of the relationship between employment ( paid work ) and family obligations ( unpaid work ) is essential to enhance economic independence of women and consequently gender equality . #% Any future agreement must both recognise Israel 's right to live in peace and security and ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are protected and promoted . #% There is also a more sinister side to this counterfeiting and piracy . #% Agriculture in my constituency of Northern Ireland still remains our most significant industry . #% Although these problems have now been resolved , there was not sufficient time for substantial negotiations to be undertaken . #% Let me quote BNFL 's own words : `` At company level it has been recognised that in the mind of many stake holders quality and safety are inextricably linked . #% rapporteur . - Madam President , I agree with Mr Deva that we gave up certain of our rights . #% I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds . #% in writing . - More investment in research and innovation is essential to guarantee a sustainable and competitive future for our economies . #% Failure is relative . #% What should Europe 's role be in an increasingly globalised world and how can the European Union be brought closer to its citizens ? #% Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent ? #% Mr President , homeopathic medicine has been officially recognised in certain Member States for many years but has been barely tolerated in others . #% Interest rate fluctuations have meant that borrowing for business expansion or house buying has proven to be a very risky undertaking , often resulting in bankruptcy or house repossessions when interest rates have drifted above the average levels . #% The United States ' concern for the starving populations of the world is as genuine as George Bush 's concern for the Iraqi people 's rights . #% I voted against the resolution for several reasons . #% An average of ten persons are killed per day in Colombia because of socio-political violence . #% While the report is welcome , certain areas remain unclear ; for example , whether existing wilderness areas or potential future wilderness areas are being discussed . #% I do not consider it an abortifacient . #% I say that if the scientists can not go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing . #% Despite Commissioner Fischler being very dismissive of this when he presented his proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development last month , I still hold firmly to my view . #% As a result of this new directive there will be a threefold reduction in the sulphur content of petrol in cars and a seven-fold reduction in the sulphur content of diesel by 2005 . #% The recovery issue and the judgment of the European Court of Justice really do not impact on Ireland as we have no recovery or incineration facilities at the moment and will not have for some time to come . #% As my colleagues have already said , the SME sector accounts for over 66 % of all employment within the EU . #% We remain willing to assist them in the search for permanent peace in their beautiful country . #% Therefore I welcome the initiatives from the discussion of structural funds and employment opportunities at the Madrid informal Council in December 1995 to the final communication in March 1996 . #% To make it easier for people to support it we have removed the second part . #% Let us put more money in the budget , change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener . #% While they state that they support the ban on ` reproductive cloning ' , they have already patented and commercialised human closed cells in order to treat age-related and degenerative diseases . #% Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi . #% I believe the undignified delay is the primary cause of all this concern and therefore , if we have political anger , while we are entitled to feel and express that anger , we should direct it at those who have caused the delay : that is most certainly not you and it is not the office of the Presidency of the European Parliament . #% There are so many examples of how not to do it , but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated . #% As we become consumers we increasingly ask , can we afford a child ? #% 2012 also presents particular opportunities for Belfast as it is the centenary of the Titanic -- I might add that we had a ` titanic ' victory last night on the football field over England ! #% Mr President , can I first of all apologise to you , your predecessor and the House for my late arrival . #% Commissioner , it appears that you have set your face against the retention of duty-free sales . #% We would recommend that the final version of the compliance protocol establish a modern and open verification regime capable of adjusting to changes in political climate and in technological capabilities . #% It is next to lamentable . #% They have now gone one step further and developed the first degree programme via the Internet which is a BSc in Rural Development . #% In conclusion , I wish to put on the record again my appreciation of the Commissioner 's commitment to agriculture and to rural development . #% These two processes can not be linked - it is just not acceptable . #% We need to breathe new life into the round . #% Allied to these exciting developments is the emergence of a Franco-British proposal to establish a force of 40,000 by 2003 to cover all Petersberg Tasks on a permanent basis . #% I urge all colleagues to support this resolution . #% There are two reasons why flooding is becoming such a problem . #% We seem paralysed in the face of this obscenity . #% Mr President , I can understand the reasoning behind not being able to do it electronically , because you can not check whether everyone uses their card . #% Those are practical measures which can assist employment growth and retention . #% That is why the Committee on the Environment took out all mention of health programmes from the document . #% Madam President , as my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy . #% I want to focus my remarks this evening on the fishing industry , and of course one of the sectors excluded is sea fishing . #% We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue . #% If you look at why Ireland is divided , it is because the successful people were given small pieces of land . #% We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction . #% There are several aspects of concern for Chile 's coastal communities : unfair competition with the local artisanal sector and the unknown impact on marine resources , for example . #% Has it considered tabling any amendments or made proposals to do so to the Euratom Treaty to allow for peer review from another Member State for a neighbouring nuclear power station ? #% 
The other thing I would like to point out is that there are companies , such as British Nuclear Fuels , who have absolutely no sense of public responsibility or environmental awareness . #% These include the United Kingdom , where nothing more than lip service has been paid to the development of organic farming . #% Based on advice from the Scientific Steering Committee , it is appropriate that an adequate transitional period be laid down for the phasing out of the remaining antibiotics currently used in compounds for disease prevention . #% We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things . #% We can probably put the underlying situation right in the longer term , but it shows how wrong it is to jump to conclusions at a very early point . #% Little wonder it is the richest party in Ireland . #% Specifically , how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption ? #% People still do not feel adequately protected . #% If the Irish Government is allowed to go ahead with this , how would it square with other Member States who could follow suit and do exactly the same ? #% There are currently 37 different chapters of negotiation to be discussed between the Union and the new applicant countries . #% I accept the Commissioner 's reasoning that there must be greater concentration of resources in the next perspective . #% The devil will be in the detail , of course , and we still have a long way to go to agree a new round of regional aid programmes . #% My apologies for the inability of the shadow rapporteur , Mr Trakatellis , to be with us this evening . #% I have voted for this report although I have reservations about some aspects of it . #% Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it . #% There are two points of criticism that my colleagues and my Group have asked to seek clarification on today . #% I should like to thank the Minister for his answer . #% on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , can I begin by wishing the High Representative , Baroness Ashton , well in the many challenges that she faces during her mandate . #% We must learn from our mistakes in regard to decimalisation and ensure that they are not repeated when the single European currency is introduced . #% It is important for these systems to be in place to prevent the regulatory crisis of 2008 from occurring again . #% The kind of conditions they have to endure in large vessels are not acceptable , so if new vessels are being built we should ensure that the best standards possible are complied with and that measures are taken to ensure that , where live animals must be transported by sea in large vessels , all measures are taken to optimise conditions for them . #% I understand the meeting of the internal market is on 26 November and it is hoped to adopt a common position at that Council meeting on that date . #% More recently the EU Commission took the first step towards legal action against Ireland for inadequate monitoring and control of water pollution from agricultural sources . #% The efforts at Community level complement those of Member States . #% I hope the voting lists can be changed along those lines . #% Should the Union be in a position not only to allow a Member to leave but also to expel a Member because it no longer meets the criterion , which is that it must be a democracy ? #% I too want to congratulate Mr Hallam on his report and thank him for his heroic efforts to shed light on a very complicated subject . #% Weapons from China can be found as far as Australia , Malaysia , Thailand , South Africa ; regular shipments are sent to Burma and Nepal . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Mombaur for his excellent report . #% When we talk about issues of concern , it is a valid question that you might take up . #% These questions and practices have not arisen so far in the Union and certainly what Mr McCartin has said here today is something that I would very much identify with and support . #% You have played your role and you can take credit for that . #% I am not aware that there is any existing difficulty . #% The accession negotiations still have to overcome other difficult issues such as state support to industry and levies on imports , but I believe they can be overcome . #% However , this progress was short lived , as the newly elected Head of State was assassinated and this triggered yet another massacre . #% I have been told that the EU no longer plans to send out a patrol vessel this year in either the Atlantic or the Mediterranean . #% Among other things , we wanted to find a way to enable women to have the number of children that women said they wanted . #% We finished up as the United States ' junior partner instead of an equal one . #% However , we must double our efforts to find an alternative to DDT because huge damage is being done to humans -- it is biocumulative -- and to our environment by our need to look after the children who are here today . #% I certainly would commend to you that you examine the question of bringing forward as part of your project a constitution for Europe in the new millennium . #% Taoiseach , I want to congratulate you on being able to bring forward a nominee for President of the Commission in Prime Minister Barroso . #% The CAP is not perfect , but it has been reformed . #% I welcome the reference to resolving the conflict in Sri Lanka given my recent involvement in this area as head of the EU electoral observation mission . #% Globally , according to the FAO , millions of tonnes of unwanted fish by-catch are thrown back into the sea each year . #% From my own perspective , I am particularly interested in the promotion of sustainable tourism , for a number of reasons . #% The one-size-fits-all situation was always going to be a problem . #% With the greatest of respect , it would be arrogant on our part not to do so . #% We need to do more to spell out clearly to young people the brutal consequences for one 's health from cigarette smoking - that three thousand people in Europe die every day from cigarette smoking . #% She was given no assistance in spite of the fact that both Mr di Pietro and the bodyguard knew that Mrs Baldi was there as a guest of honour from this institution . #% Madam President , on Tuesday night in this House I made my position clear in a speech on BSE . #% One hand does not seem to know what the other is doing . #% At the moment only 2.5 % is spent in Africa in this area and that is mainly in Morocco and South Africa , and none in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa as such . #% We only have to look at the many problems we have facing our borders today - drugs , human trafficking , international crime and terrorism , to name but a few - to see the need for that . #% Paving the way for minimum tax rates or corporate tax plans will not prevent companies from looking outside the EU for more competitive rates . #% Firstly , can he give a guarantee here to us that this Court of Auditors ' survey will not be used to try and reduce the amount of money which is being appropriated for the SME sector , and in particular for the employment-creation aspect of it ? #% To add insult to injury , the exclusion of these countries has been deemed as necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the United States . #% This is something that we are going to see happening again if we do not look at our whole policy - this fortress Europe mentality - the fact that we are building the barricades and the walls higher and higher . #% In conclusion , as regards setting the tolerance thresholds for adventitious presence of bone spicules and technically unavoidable contamination , it is imperative that we apply scientific rigour through standing committees under the comitology procedure . #% I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve . #% As other speakers have said , it does show Parliament at its most hard-working and efficient . #% The Commission must be given a central coordinating role in public health to deal with illnesses , from detecting their origin to their actual treatment . #% I am very confident that , if proposals are included in this plan to deal with our waste problem in a novel manner , the European Commission will financially support alternative waste-disposal methods during the next round of EU Structural Funds . #% When he first came into this House and made his maiden speech , he spoke about the rights of pensioners and the duty that each of us had towards them for the future . #% The challenge now is to let democrats move on without them . #% I want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on putting together what I regard as a decent framework within which to move forward . #% Mr President , let me start by saying that I agree with absolutely every word the last speaker said ; I shall not repeat it all , but well done ! #%
