I congratulate Mr Pronk on his proposals with regard to the very technical aspect of providing venture capital to these small enterprises , so that Europe once again can be in the lead in creating new employment . #% The agricultural proposals , as represented in Agenda 2000 , are not satisfactory , particularly from an Irish perspective . #% It is important to retain the current quota management system and I do not support mandatory privatisation of quotas . #% In light of the recent investigation by the Commission into the arrangements of Ryanair at Charleroi Airport , is it not now the case that regional airports in Europe are unsure how state aid rules are going to apply in the future and that this in itself is going to impinge on legitimate commercial decisions they would like to take , as well as on their future development ? #% In a recent national poll , nine out of ten Irish people stated that they did not understand the Treaty of Nice and voter apathy is extremely high . #% Madam President , at least three times I went searching for our Finnish colleague to assure him , as I was assured in the last plenary part-session , that he would be handed a card that would enable him to not just hear , but to see Finnish television in Parliament . #% We can not really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector . #% To say this is to use a sort of accountancy jargon that puts the whole issue beyond the understanding of the ordinary European citizen . #% By sticking to the Montreal Convention and the ECAC figures I hope we have been able to find and bring forward a balanced report that will hopefully find a way forward . #% I would ask you , Mr President , on behalf of the third largest group in this Parliament to protest at the treatment meted out to Members of the European Parliament by the Angolan Government . #% She is a lady who I have worked a lot with in the past on the National Economic and Social Forum and whose opinion I have great respect for and whose guidance I would take on many occasions . #% I wish those still in hospital a speedy recovery . #% At present , there is nothing to prevent a European shipowner from exporting his ship to one of these countries , receiving a very healthy subsidy of EUR 1 million or more and still keeping his ship . #% As Ban Ki-moon said in Rome , at a time when the global population is growing and our global climate is changing , by 2050 , we will need to produce 70 % more food , yet the weather is becoming more extreme and unpredictable . #% So why are we so unable to make headway in this part of the world ? #% It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China . #% As someone who focuses on agricultural and rural issues , I heartily welcome this initiative . #% Mr President , it is a time of crisis in the Middle East but also perhaps a time of opportunity . #% The same applies to Irish cattle . #% Events of recent days clearly bring this possibility into focus and must surely alert Parliament to the need for quick and positive action . #% Commission involvement in Member States ' tax arrangements must come with a serious health warning . #% Under the new CAP , the risk and crisis measures that we had all become used to were dismantled and the onus on the protection , prevention and management of crises has shifted squarely onto the farmers ' shoulders . #% I would urge , as others have urged , that the new rapid reaction force should not have available to it these types of weapons . #% Because , ultimately , if we really want to respond to what is occurring in the European Union of today , we must first recognise that , whatever crisis we may perceive , the people out there do not see it as a crisis . #% There was some general agreement at the last meeting of EU foreign ministers , held in Rhodes on 3 May , that the EU must play a stronger role in the post-conflict situation in Iraq . #% I also accept the declaration , albeit reluctantly . #% Nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every Member State and they were not . #% However , it is also necessary that the parliamentarians represent the same European people by ensuring that there is no frivolous spending , no unnecessary price increases , and that value is found in a market where suppliers and businesspeople are fighting for every last euro . #% Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures . #% We must send a signal to counterfeiters and pirates that we are serious about closing the enforcement loopholes that they exploit . #% As I came here to speak tonight , the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider -- as is its duty -- the proposed change in the legal base in the common position . #% It is important to preserve the rights of Member State parliaments and governments to ensure that existing legislation in these areas can be maintained . #% This situation has to be addressed . #% Many of us had hoped that the single market would have produced strong competition in the insurance sector , resulting in lower premia for consumers . #% The EU had an opportunity to be an equal partner with the United States in responding to this crisis . #% I voted against Amendment 28 in order to secure the reference to national law on family or family status , including reproductive rights . #% However , there are dangers in drawing parallels between the Irish Peace Process and the situation that currently exists in Spain . #% I accept that the presidency views this as a serious problem . #% The bottom line is that if we want people in Europe in every country to initiate a new experiment in sharing their democracy , sovereignty , benefits of freedoms , then we , as their elected representatives have to lead courageously by spelling out in great detail how it will work . #% Madam President , I should like to thank Mr Gallagher , the rapporteur , for this report on the Commission proposal for the renewal of the tuna agreement with Madagascar for a further three years . #% The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future . #% As a committee , we have re-tabled an amendment and are calling on Parliament to fully support this amendment . #% I am sure you are right - and we have had discussions about this - to reject a moratorium on disputes or , indeed , a derogation . #% Under the proposal , key information contained in the court files in the Member States would be copied , using a standard form , to a centralised database for on-line access by interested parties . #% It is essential that individuals who are directly affected by breaches of environmental law have a means of redress , whether through an appeal body , the Ombudsman or , if necessary , through the courts . #% Countless women die giving birth every year . #% The European Parliament , as the democratically elected European body which will later on colegislate on the Commission proposal for the Capital Requirements Directive ( CRD 4 Directive ) , should be involved in the negotiations process at an early stage . #% After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending . #% I am very glad that we finally put this directive to bed in the last session . #% Madam President , I am rather sorry that Mr Chichester chose to end his contribution with a plea for building more nuclear power stations . #% The European Union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines . #% Undoubtedly there are some Members who have some reservations about this resolution , particularly if they support the establishment of an EU defence policy . #% I would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement of the proposed legislation . #% The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda , taking more account of environmental concerns , is becoming more widely accepted . #% I hope that this initiative , tabled by Ireland , France , Portugal , Spain , the UK and Belgium within the UN 's International Maritime Organisation , will have the full support of all current and future Member States . #% In this respect , I hope the Commission will continue its efforts on the international scene to impress upon the US the necessity to come on board on this vital issue . #% For them today comes too late , but for the rest of us it is hopefully a beginning . #% This assumption is open to question in my view . #% One of the main problems with providing education in many countries is the catastrophic effect AIDS is having on the lives not just of children , many of whom are orphans because they have lost one or both parents . #% I appreciate the honourable Member 's kind compliment . #% It has been estimated that some 20 000 paedophiles in Europe use the Internet daily . #% Galileo has proved to be a tremendous success and I hold the view that it is vital for Europe to continue to invest in this key technology into the future . #% It is quite clear that they were wrongfully imprisoned in the first place : they were fighting for self-determination , their human rights have been abused over and over again , and they have to be released , because they have spent a long time in prison for no real reason other than asserting the right to self-determination . #% Under the Spanish Presidency , negotiations for future European enlargement are continuing at a strong pace . #% As Mrs Schroedter said , there was a unanimous vote in the Committee on Regional Policy but I think she would also admit that was as a result of very substantial amendments tabled by many political groups , and , indeed , we have much more work to do in this area . #% I hope that the Spanish Government can reach agreement quickly on the location of these important agencies , in particular the European Food Authority and the European Maritime Safety Agency . #% 
The delegation included lawyers , politicians and trade unionists . #% Many European states do not implement the Hague Convention either in spirit or , indeed , in law . #% Enlargement can go ahead without the Nice Treaty . #% If we do , it will not happen by accident . #% There can not , and we must stop this exploding of these toxic materials in the atmosphere for the good of the citizens of the world and for the sake of the planet . #% I can not see how people can justify voting against such principles . #% In 1985 the Irish Government failed to obtain a derogation , as Mrs Fontaine has said , from the strictest provisions in the directive concerning recognition of architects ' qualifications . #% There is a serious loophole in relation to where weapons go , who uses them and what the end consequence is . #% The Union can achieve a great deal in the creation of a single market for goods , services and capital . #% The rapporteur 's proposal for regular progress reports on joint actions will lead to ongoing evaluation , thus ensuring maximum value in respect of funding and , more importantly , greater effectiveness of the programmes themselves . #% Mr President , I thank you for your very kind remarks about Women 's Day , and a very happy day to all the brothers and sisters in the House and indeed in the gallery . #% Principle number one is respect for difference . #% The subject matter is vast and varied . #% This is a man who has been informing the rest of the world of the suffering , injustice and tragedy that continues there . #% I welcome the fact that the Council in Barcelona recognised that reality . #% The MRL problem gives rise to greatest concern in these minor food-producing species , such as horses , goats , rabbits , fish , bees - minor in terms of their economic importance for the pharmaceutical companies , hence their lack of defence of the various veterinary products required . #% According to the Commission 's Green Paper , no full assessment of the risks connected with the use of lead-based products - which include PVC stabilisers - has been completed . #% We need to constrain them , not develop them . #% We can distribute responsibility around the various Member States , but we must have a coordinated policy . #% However , now is a time for us to be braver , to look at new ideas and new ways of engagement . #% Our aim in this context must be to maximise Ireland 's share of the structural funds . #% Consensus building - which is at the centre of policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency - could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints on the war in Iraq taken by different countries in Europe . #% In particular , I would refer to the inclusion of a positive list of allowed nutritional health claims . #% The consumer has a right to know this . #% I regret that the issue of arms exports has not been seriously addressed in the Rocard report . #% There is a need for greater communication and understanding not only of what Europe does but also of the responsibility of its citizens to ensure we are as good as we can be . #% Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 . #% And of course we must tackle infertility . #% Madam President , I want to put a question on the issue of our order of business , so I am not expressing a view for or against . #% We must be committed to ensuring the widest range of opinions and values , and that they are nurtured , expressed and considered because debate can only increase knowledge and improve the quality of decisions . #% Mr President , at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs for their tremendous work on this very important piece of legislation . #% Many have lost their children , their health , their homes and livelihoods . #% In another stand-off in Bantry , County Cork , people are camping out at strategic positions , blocking workers sent to run unnecessary over-the-ground high-voltage power lines across their farms . #% Mr Crowley welcomed the report . #% It was of course disappointing that the British Conservative rapporteur informed me of his decision to abandon these important provisions for consumers and users in order to achieve political expediency . #% It is illogical to use different strands of the cohesion policy to tackle their socio-economic problems . #% Since the provision of abortion is not an EU competence and since the principle of subsidiarity is enshrined in the Treaties I have no choice but to reject this report . #% We now have the ludicrous situation of the nuclear industry shopping dangerous radioactive material around the planet . #% We do not have to decide for another 15 or 20 years about investment in a new form of power . #% Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita . #% Rejection may not be palatable , but it must be faced . #% I was a member of a local council for many years and I did not think it would take so long for the various Member States to coordinate action in this area . #% This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some , if not all , of the developing world . #% There is now a growing political will to introduce changes to the international intellectual property rights system so that drugs to combat AIDS can be given to those countries which do not have the money to pay for them . #% To pretend GM food contaminant can be labelled organic is so ludicrous that we have to ask why this possibility is allowed for in this directive . #% All of those and the work on the common area of justice and security are to the credit of the Commission . #% It is ironic that at a time when the European Union and this Parliament are striving to diminish smoking because of its serious health consequences , in another area we are trying to allow people to freely damage their own health with drugs that have been proved to damage health and create other problems . #% Mr Oostlander 's report is part of this approach at EU level and is to be welcomed . #% Mr President , I believe that both Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli would be very proud of the events of 1 May . #% In particular it was found that the British decision to alter the manufacturing process which lowered sterilization standards for meat and bonemeal used in compound feeding stuffs for cattle allowed the emergence of the disease . #% There will always be accidents . #% I turn to the Council , Commission and Parliament : if we believe in democracy -- especially in this process that you , Mr President , called the most important since the founding of the Union -- I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process , to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people , especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate , and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired . #% There is no need to have any other system . #% The matching of skills to jobs is crucial , but I am very concerned on many fronts , Commissioner . #% We can not lose sight of them either . #% The practice of there being a de facto national quota for senior staff appointments in the Commission must end . #% Why is it that our services can not give us simple and straightforward information ? #% That is not under debate , although those matters should be debated in the UK and elsewhere . #% However , I support the remaining provisions of what is already an emaciated directive . #% I do not feel that harmonisation of fuel taxes has an essential part to play . #% I might also inform the House that we are awaiting the Commission detailed proposal on the TENs issue which the honourable Member has addressed . #% On a final point , I believe that the quaestors asked you to take those signing-in sheets inside Parliament but that you refused . #% That means , in the simplest terms , that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism . #% We continue to have very serious problems with countries that have not signed the Hague Convention and where there are still a number of abduction cases . #% Finally , I would suggest that the Commission needs urgently to take on board the suspicions regarding price-fixing with regard to roaming mobile telephone calls . #% With regard to the IGC , the failure to reach agreement at the December Brussels Summit is , undoubtedly , a serious setback for the European Union , but it is not a crisis . #% 
A major part of this work will be ensuring greater economic policy coordination between all 15 Member States . #% Whatever measures we take to ensure the free movement of goods must not undermine the right to industrial action or peaceful protest by the EU workforce . #% Firstly , we are in favour of protection of the people of the European Union . #% I also want to welcome the positive response from the Commissioners . #% I understand , Commissioner , that you have already made it clear to the Irish Government , that this strategy will not result in any extra funding for Ireland . #% In conclusion , I have had much representation in Ireland on the need to take cognisance of the special vintage car industry in Europe . #% There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure . #% We should not have a report on which everyone in Europe has their say but the people who commissioned the report are not players in the field . #% The initial expenditure required to tackle this fraud would be more than compensated for by the gains in revenue by the Member States . #% I also want to congratulate Mrs Bauer on her report . #% In some places in Germany , mobile abattoirs are provided to slaughter animals if no abattoir is available locally . #% This was despite their not having the exact qualifications laid down elsewhere in the directive . #% I would say to the honourable Member , who I know to be an honourable man , that the problem of Northern Ireland is a problem of double minority . #% If both we and the US work together in common cause , there is just a possibility that we could halt the continuing slide into regional conflict and restore peace negotiations once again on the basis of the Mitchell recommendations . #% Of course , as long as these products are cheaper on world markets than they are in the European Union and as long as we have surpluses , there is no possibility that anybody can comply with that order , because it will obviously mean cheaper cereals from outside . #% The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer . #% It is unfortunate that we have not been able to utilise our time with them to discuss the document which they presented to the Conference of Presidents last week with regard to the future European social model . #% There are many lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the outbreak . #% Mr President , as we have heard yet again today the Cardiff Summit has reiterated the foundations of EU foreign policy in Kosovo , which calls for the cessation of violence , a return to the negotiating table and engagement in a vigorous political process as the only solution to the Kosovo crisis . #% It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do , we will reap a terrible harvest in the future . #% Could I , in that context , ask the Council and the Commission to agree that the first priority in any referendum should be that it should be seen to be both free and fair ? #% The EU demands traceability , cross-compliance and food security from its farmers , and rightly so , but in return it is threatening to break its promises , causing huge uncertainty in the agricultural community , and it is proposing to sell out its primary food producers for a quick-fix deal . #% The longer we allow the confusion to exist , the greater the delay in enabling society to benefit from its full potential . #% First of all , there must be a restatement of commitment and idealism in respect of the Lisbon Agenda , establishing the genuine goals and targets of having , by 2010 , the most dynamic economy in the world and creating the investment , research and development that we will need to create new jobs and new opportunities . #% Does the Commission not have any appreciation that the opponents of the Constitution are just as proud of the defeat of Nazism as anyone else and that we take great offence when she tries to hijack and monopolise that sentiment in order to advance the political agenda of seeking to promote this Constitution ? #% The Irish Government has declared the fight against drugs a priority of its presidency . #% What I welcome today in the Donnelly report and in the Commission 's earlier report , is that this is the type of strategy that enables . #% In respect of the García Arias report on competition policy , I wish to put down a very clear political marker that whereas the Liberal Group is prepared to support this report in general , there is one specific blockage and condition in respect of our support and that relates to paragraph 15 and the call for the amendment in the IGC of Article 90 ( 2 ) . #% in writing . - It is important that Europe reaffirms its commitment to , and cooperation with , international movements like the UN at this time . #% Mr President , I should like to join with my other Irish colleagues in acknowledging the Commission response in helping to alleviate what was a very serious problem for Irish early lamb producers . #% We voted with our Spanish colleagues , so the onus is on the Council and not the Member States to meet any shortfall that arises . #% Not all the transitional issues are just for the applicants , particularly in agriculture , regional policy and cohesion policy . #% It is also important to try to correct the situation where things have gone wrong , but in so doing not to exaggerate it in such a way as to create in the European public 's mind an image of a European Union that is out of control , that is a sea of corruption and can not be trusted with taxpayers ' money . #% We believe that we have a fair and just deal for Member States . #% The bureaucratic planning authorities which , with their dogmatic beliefs , are destroying and depopulating rural society , need to show more understanding . #% The idea of a minimum target for recovery will to a certain extent force Member States who do not have incineration to bring it in or to use that as an excuse . #% If we are talking about implementing new forms of work and working time , we must surely know what we are trying to achieve and the basis that we are starting from . #% Although I would like to see some tangible progress for the poorest nations , I suppose I should be grateful that in this latest round of talks no more Irish agriculture has been given away . #% We must push out the frontiers of research but in an open and transparent way . #% This must be a key part of the European Research Area . #% If we want to play a role in this and want to be seen as honest brokers , then all Member States should follow the recommendation of this report and grant visas to the Taiwanese President and members of the government for private visits to the EU . #% R [ amp ] D is one element in the overall mix that determines competitiveness . #% That is a study carried out by a foundation funded by the European Union . #% The reason I raise this issue is that a number of Commissioners - Monti , Liikanen , Solbes Mira , Verheugen , Vitorino and Bolkestein - have all in the past attended Bilderberg meetings . #% I would stress again that these are difficult times for farmers . #% This European causebook is very much to be welcomed and I hope that we will be able to support this report . #% Now , the Union 's institutions will fall within the scope of this fundamental rights protection system . #% I have recently been to Romania and visited some of the institutions we have discussed . #% Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy . #% I would ask the President if he could instruct the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control to look into this issue , because it should be dealt with very quickly . #% In conclusion , when it comes to addressing the challenges of EU enlargement , certainty , determination and commitment are all words that can be used to sum up the opinions of the vast majority of the people living in Europe as well as those of legislators working on these important issues within the different EU institutions . #% I would like to see the programme supporting efforts to increase young people 's awareness of the political system and indeed the promotion and the development of civics as well , although I know schools are not included in these particular programmes . #% Developing countries claim correctly they did not cause this crisis . #% I would commend to you , Mr President , that you should -- as you remarked -- stand by the ruling . #% Recently , it was revealed that , over a period of eight months from August 2004 to April 2005 , 83 000 litres of radioactive material containing 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium leaked unnoticed from a broken pipe into a containment tank . #% In particular , in Mr Hernández Mollar 's report one sees the basis for employment creation and , most importantly of all , employment retention - looking at ways of maintaining jobs as well as creating new ones . #% Why has that been cut ? #% I welcome the return of this report from conciliation and I hope it will not be too long before all our Member States transpose it and it becomes law . #% The UK does not operate a system of levies and we do not want to see it introduced through the back door . #% In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has , to a large extent , developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing . #% As we speak in this House , four - five - and six-year-old children in a small area of Belfast in Northern Ireland are being terrorised by so-called protests . #% One option to reform the European Union budget which is not acceptable is the renationalising of the common agricultural policy back into the remit of the individual Member States . #% They are thereby depriving both the urban and rural poor of the full benefit of funds and , indeed , state aid . #% The future reform of structural funding will bring about many changes to regions within the original 15 Member States . #% It could also play a number of additional roles in EU waters , such as providing an adequate emergency response mechanism should an environmental disaster , such as the , occur again . #% On welfare , therapeutic and economic grounds , it is essential that European veterinarians have access to the fullest possible range of veterinary medicines to treat all food-producing animals , while at the same time keeping consumer health protection at the top of all our agendas . #% 
Citizens are looking to us to make the right choice : to get rid of crippling protectionism in the single market in services and protect working and consumer rights . #% I agree that the sooner we can get to a system away from all these complicated measures to assist the regions , the better , just like in the case of the structural funds . #% I have a number of points to make in the brief time available . #% However , the terms of the analysis that has been carried out must be broadened to consider the very important social consequences of what is essentially a unique social service . #% That gives confidence to people , particularly in the peripheral areas . #% The PPE-DE Group supports the middle-way approach for increased Tibetan autonomy or self-government within a united China that is respectful of cultural , religious and linguistic diversity . #% Mr President , it is difficult to make any real contribution to the services directive debate in a two-minute time-slot . #% I find it amazing that only three states have actually applied . #% And we should not hesitate to tell our people who live in Western Europe today , that they have better lives than any previous generation anywhere . #% There is an onus on the European Union , if it adheres to the EU Treaties and respects the European Convention on Human Rights , to do something . #% It does not make me necessarily glad but , because of now leading the largest party in Northern Ireland , I have more duties at home and I feel I must attend to them , especially at this time when certain talks are taking place . #% Finally , I call on the Cologne European Council to take the decision to begin negotiations on Malta 's accession by the end of this year . #% It is understandable to be concerned about poultry welfare , but there is no sense in so hyping welfare requirements in the EU that we drive producers out of business and become dependent on imports from Far Eastern and South American countries where no enforceable welfare restraints apply to production . #% The proposal to use a single market legal base and also impose additional bans in the annex is a blunt instrument that industry , the Commission and the Council can not accept . #% Parliament should call upon the United Nations Security Council to be convened , to take control of the situation and to mandate the Secretary-General to initiate steps to stop the war . #% I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner . #% I should like to say to you , Mr Prodi , directly on behalf of my group , not as advice nor as an instruction but as a suggestion that you might like to think about , that you should seek in the coming days - and especially tomorrow in your dialogue with the European Council - to assert your own independence , not just of the needs of this House , but of some of the parameters of the Council itself . #% No discrimination against the Spaniards is intended here . #% This summit did not meet the standard set by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety of this Parliament and by civil society around the world , which have called for no less than EUR 30 billion to be pledged by the EU and , crucially , for a firm commitment that this would be new and additional to existing overseas development aid . #% I thank the President-in-Office again for his reply , but I would urge that this be followed more closely still with regard to the most basic human rights that I have mentioned . #% The goodwill has been translated into three packages : Northern Ireland got Priority 1 status when its economic development stage would not have justified it ; the Delors package and the International Fund for Ireland all together have made a fairly remarkable contribution to getting voluntary workers to come together . #% In particular I should like to thank them on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , and indeed the Socialist Members , for the very good work that was done throughout that period on the reform of the structural fund process . #% I served on Mr Davignon 's panel and it is certainly consistent with the panel 's views . #% Can Mrs Schreyer confirm that ? #% It is a major issue , along with exotic diseases and imports of diseases and problems . #% So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished . #% It is now incumbent on those who have influence in Northern Ireland and those who have influence on these members of the IRA and other political organisations to give them up to the police service and the prosecution ; to allow for justice to rule and prevail . #% Such is the case with the British government 's nuclear installation at Sellafield . #% In the case of Ireland , we export young animals for finishing ; so live transport is essential and central to the agricultural economy . #% Even if the tone of the communications today is rather low-key , they represent the crossing of a major institutional threshold . #% Cattle farming has always been a low-profit enterprise and even with generous EC subsidy many farmers are not making an acceptable profit . #% We are trying to demonstrate that it is possible at a global level to achieve the dream of democratic global governance . #% We welcome the green light given to Cyprus but it now requires a deeper EU-led engagement to resolve that problem under the aegis of the United Nations . #% Greater involvement of fishermen and stakeholders in the management process is long overdue . #% They may want to work , or choose to , and even if they do not , they may need to earn because mortgages must be paid and food must be put on the table . #% Zaire , as we know , is a by-word for exploitation and plunder . #% I think that emphasis should be put on the building of coastguard or marine protection vessels to control and monitor the common fisheries policy . #% It is a very important report , and a very important position has been adopted by the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy . #% The European Council ' s common position of June of this year seeks to establish a European framework for electronic signatures . #% We can not create a Europe that the people will feel is theirs if we simply talk about economics and money all the time . #% Negotiations have been going on ; letters have been going backwards and forwards but nothing has actually happened . #% If not , then what are the proposals from the Council - especially the incoming Irish presidency if it has any - with regard to implementing a new article to ensure that these social action programmes can be undertaken ? #% In the long run this will only be possible if each country has a full seat in the College of Commissioners . #% None of us want to see any more death or grief in any region of the European Union , in particular there where the situation has been so tragic for so long . #% I would ask the President-in-Office to foster a coalition of nuclear-free states within the European Union . #% If the EU has a competence , things happen . #% There is a strong , growing realisation that we must re-invigorate the process to put in place a new European Union treaty , and delay and prevarication , recrimination and confrontation do nothing whatsoever to move this political process forward . #% More civilians have died in Darfur than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined . #% It is also an assault on individual Member States ' policies . #% I appreciate the progress that has been made , but it is totally unacceptable in the 21st century that legislation continues to be made in this way . #% Furthermore , the existence of poverty and unemployment throughout the Union constitute continuing breaches of fundamental human rights . #% At the moment it is unused and is guarded by Turkish troops . #% This should be supported , and a proper evaluation of what has already been imposed conducted , before any new decisions are taken that will have a discriminatory effect on the Northern Ireland fishing fleet . #% I believe that clarity is lacking . #% Other experiences in the Irish health system have informed my reading of this report . #% However , I am not convinced on the second point , despite the Commissioner 's protestations on many occasions that we have played our WTO cards wisely . #% On current predictions Ireland ' s emissions will be up to 40 % above this target . #% The minister representing the United Kingdom presidency , John Battle , is one of the enthusiasts for renewable energy and he has personally reassured me that he will not allow ALTENER II to slip away until it is too late to implement . #% We voted `` no '' because of those kinds of problems . #% I think this is unrealistic . #% Mr President , I rise on the issue of human rights abuses in Colombia . #% Therefore , it is incumbent on us , as we benefit spiritually from the material these people produce , to put in place protection to guarantee that their rights will not be usurped by pirates or others . #% Businesses need to be clear about the standards and practices they must aspire to in order to be able to deliver on this directive . #% I would like to mention another point . #% Information is the key to controlling , monitoring and being effective when diseases occur , and I am glad to see that we will be looking at better information systems within Member States and between Member States . #% I would also like to remind the European Commission that before the recent economic success in Ireland , the Irish people were required to make major sacrifices so as to guarantee that economic growth could take place . #% 
This will give a green light to secret services to put under surveillance people whose activities are entirely democratic and legal . #% In Ireland there is certainly a short-term crisis for beef and sheep producers which could not have been foreseen at the time of the 1992 reform . #% All the institutions of the Union have to apply themselves to simplifying the regulations by which we implement European regional policy before the new programme comes in and before enlargement in four years ' time . #% Most organizations which operate on a multinational basis have developed a policy of rotating senior staff . #% It is also necessary to provide the mechanism to guarantee the safety not only of those working in the field of biotechnology but also of the general public . #% Comrades and colleagues in this Parliament , we need public support for the European Union . #% That return is not just about esoteric ideals , but about creating real solutions to the problems that people face in their lives . #% Madam President , I , like the other speakers , would congratulate the rapporteur and also the Commission for bringing forward this whole debate at the moment because we are at a vital juncture within the development of the European economy . #% This has resulted in some very good publicity for Parliament . #% What you are dealing with is vitally important for all of us . #% This has , of course , put Ireland in the solid economic position which it is in today to meet the convergence criteria of EMU . #% Israel is not a normal country because many of the present government 's actions are completely unacceptable : building a fence , occupying territory , breaching human rights , using repression . #% I have experienced this myself and I know how urgent it is to get this resolved for people in Europe . #% It is of the utmost importance that the tens of thousands of jobs currently under threat in the aviation industry are saved . #% Mr President , I am very pleased we have been able to have this debate today following the initiative of my own political group to draw up an own initiative report on EMU and economic and social cohesion . #% So far , we have ignored the reality that there are some parts of Europe that are not connected by a land bridge or indeed rail tunnel . #% I should like to congratulate the police service of Northern Ireland on overcoming an IRA-orchestrated and ongoing campaign of intimidation to begin the process of securing justice in this notorious case . #% On behalf of the people of Northern Ireland , I thank those who have worked so hard to ensure that this report was able to go through its parliamentary stages at speed . #% They are the people who are best-placed to do so . #% We have to learn the lessons of Bosnia and apply them as well . #% The report points to a real way forward , in the fields both of preparation and deterrence . #% Racism is a crime - a crime that is not pursued in the Union , an offence against a law that is not enforced in the Union . #% It is also significant that the resolution before the United Nations in no way contradicts either existing EU or NATO policies . #% Mr President , I support Mr Bowe and his report and the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection . #% It is a sensible and workable decision , through which we have limited the scope of this directive . #% Mr President , I should like to ask for your permission to make a brief personal statement under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure . #% It is one that still requires unanimous agreement , and I think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the Treaties do not allow the Commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation . #% Robbing a poor Peter to pay Paul is an inverse Robin Hood policy and is at best perverse . #% In other words , the rest of it must be subsidised for use in animal feed and other things . #% In the case of the Irish national airline , Aer Lingus , 40 % of their business and 60 % of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes . #% On reducing exhaust emissions from passenger cars , I support the proposal that systems be installed in new cars from the year 2000 onward to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment in passenger vehicles . #% Europe has tremendous linguistic and cultural diversity and this must be capitalised on through the audiovisual sector . #% All of this could now be prevented because a patent could be placed on the menu option , on the one-click option or in numerous other areas of operation . #% It will be the Irish taxpayers who will pay the penalties ! #% This new interinstitutional approach within the European Union was certainly in evidence at the Tampere Summit . #% I am happy with the report 's cautionary aspect . #% Member States should finance measures , including observer programmes , to monitor their responsibilities . #% The current programmes must be streamlined and simplified , making application and access easier . #% I say to the Chinese authorities : please preserve it , through the middle way approach , through supporting the autonomous region of Tibet , so that we can all continue to enjoy the heritage of this absolute jewel on the world stage . #% The devastated pig producers there have had to have a financially-assisted scheme to remove unwanted animals from their farms . #% There is no magic wand that we can wave to bring about a magic solution . #% This issue of cost will have to become a parallel priority in our debates . #% Looking to changes ahead , the preparations for the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013 will be an issue during this Presidency . #% We are all struggling in the e-commerce world to get legislation that is right , to get the right balance between self-regulation and a regulatory framework which gives minimum guarantees . #% These are real issues raised by EU citizens themselves , and we ignore them at our peril . #% The sale and distribution of dangerous weapons including , in particular , landmines must cease . #% Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony . #% That is something which I can not and do not support . #% The European and Irish consumer , as well as the individual producers have a right to know if enhanced competition will result in higher energy costs for the consumer and , of course , the employees working in the industry have the right to know how it is going to affect their jobs . #% In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its ` everything but arms ' initiative . #% I am not so sure . #% It seems wrong that this should be allowed to continue , particularly when there are sister banks on both sides of the border . #% The only concerted action by countries inside and outside the European Union can hope to check these dangers effectively . #% From an Irish perspective , I can inform colleagues that work is well under way to achieve this aim . #% Let the managers manage . #% The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease . #% Any exceptions to this are condemned outright by European farmers . #% General de Gaulle dreamed of a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals . #% Thus far , 22 countries have submitted an Annual Summary , meeting the basic minimum requirements of financial regulation , but not all are satisfactory . #% I hope that is not the case and I applaud Romania where it has made improvements , but much remains to be done . #% It should not be dramatised into something more than that . #% It is very well to say that the scrapping of vessels and the removal of extra capacity will lead to increased profitability , whereas in reality many a coastal community has been devastated by such a move . #% Today ' s debate is a further positive step on this important road ensuring that animal feed available to farmers is of the highest quality . #% We are going to be using that new building and therefore we have a duty to have these questions answered . #% The Members States of the Union must set up a public oil holding body and there must be harmonisation and coordination of crisis measures at European level . #% Mr President , the Commission 's proposal for a recommendation on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields was formulated against the background of increasing public concern over possible links between electromagnetic fields and health problems . #% 
This Parliament has to be very careful that it does not allow President Uribe to use this opportunity as a propaganda stunt , to give an impression that somehow the human rights situation in Colombia is improving . #% It is absolutely unacceptable that the US and Britain are allowed to gain advantage from illegal activities . #% If bus and car emissions are maintained at their current levels then the average temperature could rise by 2 % compared to 1990 levels . #% This merely corrects an oversight in the original text . #% I know that the proposed Consumer Rights Directive will deal with some issues , but cross-border air travel needs more European laws for the protection of consumers . #% The UK and the US should pause and reflect before they embark on a course of action without UN authority . #% That should also be investigated . #% The Commission has already presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet , in line with the provisions of the Council of Europe ' s cyber crime convention . #% However , what is more alarming is the projected sea-level rise , which is more than twice the three-inch rise that occurred during the latter part of the previous century . #% Many of these children who are not in school are working . #% I welcome Greece into the euro zone . #% There is no embargo on bringing armaments into that region . #% I know that it is serious about sustainability of stocks . #% They are quite small , there is not a lot of money in them , but they are in danger of fragmentation if things continue like this . #% China is a gigantic sweatshop of exploitation of workers . #% That does not mean that we should not be able to disagree on occasions , especially when we believe the strategy to be wrong . #% Madam President , I very much welcome the report on SMEs and join with other Members in congratulating the rapporteurs . #% The main subject of criticism is Islamic fundamentalism , and the report seems to concentrate too much on that . #% Over the next five years of the mandate of this Parliament , we should be striving to ensure that , in every aspect of our working life , we can give that respect and tolerance to differing viewpoints . #% ` Bushmeat ' or ` wild meat ' describes the food product of wild animals , whether consumed locally or traded commercially . #% The report also points out that financing opportunities should be widened , simplified , and made more readily available , using the funding currently provided under the European Social Fund , the Lifelong Learning Programme as a whole , and Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs . #% Like the rest of the House , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report . #% The proposed sewage plant at Galway Bay last year was a typical example . #% The Council and the Commission can help us in that regard . #% In particular I would submit that it means nothing at all for the 18 million people who we have heard of so often this morning - our fellow European citizens who are without work . #% Many Members , especially citizens in neutral countries , have no say on whether this is what they want . #% Therefore children can wander in , broadband is on and they can access the Internet straight away . #% This is a growing sector . #% On the regulation on certain fluorinated gases , there has been serious debate over the legal base : whether the legal base of the regulation should be the environment ( Article 175 of the Treaty ) or the single market ( Article 95 of the Treaty ) or whether the dual legal base proposed in the common position ( Articles 175 and 95 ) should be maintained . #% There is full support for the statute and I welcome the fact that the consultation is going to take place from the bottom up , involving everybody in a decent , fair , upright , open and democratic fashion . #% Let us all work together for the benefit of those people and hopefully other parts of this continent would look towards Northern Ireland and strive to resolve their problems in a similar way . #% It is totally incorrect and wrong that we participate in those kind of votes . #% Ireland is much more energy efficient than a decade ago . #% I disagree with you that it is not within the Council 's remit . #% Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the current comitology provisions will be replaced by delegated acts and implementing acts under Articles 290 and 291 , as has been explained , but I worry very much about the role of the Commission in implementing the decisions made in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon . #% This question asks the Commission if it is attempting to mainstream the social protection and inclusion process in the provision of medium-term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments under Council Regulation ( EC ) No 332/2002 . #% Could I ask colleagues who have problems with this to contact me in my office here as soon as possible . #% However , with 18 million people in the Union affected by unemployment including the young and the long-term unemployed , this objective is not being met . #% We can not ensure the support of the electorate of Europe for the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference unless people are fully engaged in the debate that takes place there . #% It is rather disturbing that we had the Swedish Prime Minister , coming here yesterday urging a `` yes '' vote . #% After the IGC conference there will be a wide-ranging public debate in each of the 15 EU countries and in some cases a referendum before the ratification process can be completed . #% The Commission must support educational and training programmes , to ensure that business structures take account of the opportunities which can be secured from the Internet and e-commerce in general . #% We should not be so dictatorial with our directives . #% This is unacceptable and unworkable . #% Legally-binding targets for renewable energies are an important part of this strategy , but we must also have very clearly the externalisation of internal costs in respect of traditional energy production . #% It aims to provide professional staff ready for the job , training , equipment and support for promoting healthier living in a healthier environment . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her usual very good report . #% This directive will go a long way and is extremely important because of that . #% That is why I had to vote against him . #% The Swedish government has made it clear that it intends to prioritise what is known as the 3 Es during its presidency of the Union , and this relates to addressing the key problems of enlargement of the Union , employment matters and promoting environmental issues . #% We need you to be able to communicate with us and with the citizens of the European Union . #% There has been no in-depth evaluation of the risks of error in the MSY model . #% Many scientists and organisations , such as the Pasteur Institute and the British Medical Association , have called for a ban on the use of antibiotic-resistant marker genes , which do not perform any relevant function on the plants and are therefore completely superfluous . #% I am quite satisfied that Parliament has acquired an excellent President and I am equally certain that you will conduct your duties with dignity and fair play at all times . #% Our separate role should be to analyse critically the performance of the Council and the Commission in relation to meeting targets set out in key areas outlined in an EU annual human rights report . #% One concern I have about the Commission 's document is that it focuses strongly on aid for innovation by SMEs . #% The Union has also extended funding via the European Reconstruction Agency in Serbia to Montenegro as well as to propose an extension to the recently announced trade preferences of the Balkans and the whole of Yugoslavia . #% It is not , as the rapporteur says , a substitute for the fundamental rights systems of the Member States but a complement to them . #% The control of the Fund 's activities on the ground still needs to be intensified . #% I do not believe that the European Union should be given powers to raise taxes by means of a procedure of qualified majority voting . #% Here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries . #% It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy . #% Therefore , I ask you , Commissioner , what proposals will you make to the Council of Ministers and to the expert group for enhancing and strengthening Community interest in this area ? #% Mr President , I will omit replying to that particular remark . #% Only last week , as has already been mentioned , we saw the horrific murder of one of Ireland 's foremost investigative journalists , Veronica Guerin . #% The fact that it makes them look ridiculous , takes up our time and diverts us from dealing with really important issues that affect the everyday lives of European citizens obviously does not matter to them . #% 
When that threat moves closer and they must escape , we must receive them . #% We went through terrible times to make our steel competitive . #% I would also like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by the Commission in responding so rapidly to Parliament 's resolution , which called for a general tightening up of maritime safety . #% In my view , there is a key question to be answered . #% As a step in the right direction the Greens support the idea of penalties for those countries which are not observing their legally binding commitments to reduce fleets . #% We have a right to tell the Russians that we demand standards of them with regard to freedom of expression , freedom of accountability and the freedom and the security of human life when people question and challenge authority . #% Certainly the Commission , Parliament and Member States ' governments have all worked closely together to ensure that the Stockholm Summit will be a success . #% When environmental damage occurs , the first question always is : who is going to pay ? #% In the year 2002 the euro coins and notes will become a reality and we hope be jingling in plenty in the pockets of the citizens of Europe . #% Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner . #% My main point was that this Parliament must not only uphold democracy and freedom of speech - it must be seen to do so . #% There is something wrong somewhere , Mr President . #% It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment . #% I fully support the conclusions by my colleague Richard Howitt and his call for a unified EU human rights report identifying an annual list of countries of particular concern , a sliding scale of sanctions against abuser countries , removing the national veto for their agreement , implementing the human rights and democracy clause in the EU 's international agreements and introducing human rights impact assessments for EU actions abroad . #% It has already been said that promises were given in this House by the Commission that it would undertake a social and economic impact study into the abolition of duty-free sales . #% As has been mentioned , the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union . #% Finally , I would like to see us aim for a situation where the Court of Auditors would present us with a statement which could be read in reasonable time by members of the Committee on Budgetary Control . #% I am sure in your discussions with Bob Zurlik you will remind him of that . #% Mr President , in the parliamentary tradition from which I come , we were not confined to minutes , we were very often asked at a short notice to run down to the chamber and talk for an hour or so , on every sort of insignificant subject . #% It is very good to see people here tonight providing sign language . #% Mr President , I want to speak on two matters . #% Basically what we are doing is promoting the whole attitude of xenophobia and victimising people who are already victims . #% There is nobody monitoring their health and safety . #% I support the strategy outlined in this report , I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope Parliament overwhelmingly approves it . #% That is why it is important , as the previous speaker has said , that the study of minority languages should be encouraged in the Socrates programme . #% I welcome this Report and the rules for the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality . #% Our demands have been met and now it is our duty to see the Commission pledges and rhetoric translated into action . #% We have also ensured that compensation for the incorrect installation of goods , for example wardrobes will also apply for the protection of consumers who have been misled by faulty instructions . #% I therefore strongly welcome this European initiative on dementia . #% So we have chosen to abstain . #% We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement . #% The overcrowding problem on suburban trains will also be eased by the addition of more passenger carriages , and platforms will also be lengthened . #% My group will support the explicit salary that is referred to by the rapporteur and the majority of my group will support the European tax conclusion . #% in writing . - We need to gear the EU budget for the 21st century . #% Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate today on public services . #% The Commission should hold its line and if Ecofin and the Commission hold that line we will whole-heartedly support them . #% We must be logical . #% Only then will the objective of obtaining genuine economic impact be secured for those regions . #% We need to engage in education in the real sense , to open minds to the fact that the world is extremely diverse and could be a very tolerant and good place to live if we could only live with each other . #% There are real risks if we simply address this question from an economic point of view , regarding and valuing citizens simply for the contribution they can make to the economy or the workforce . #% This is very important if we are to ensure a halt to the depletion of the ozone layer . #% These are matters strictly speaking within the competence of the Member States but it is clear that as a Union and as a Parliament we have an obligation to seek to ensure that European citizens are treated properly . #% It would be very unfair to the civilian population of Iraq to allow questions of principle to prevent effective United Nations engagement with immediate needs . #% Such information can be easily made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels . #% Firstly , do you consider waste incineration a renewable energy , because we need clarification on that ? #% I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the ` open method of cooperation ' with ` cooperation ' . #% Such a statement is blatantly dishonest and he knows that well . #% First , fishing vessels are built to fish , so fishing vessel owners are not going to be happy with their vessels sitting idle and losing money . #% I call for corrupt regimes or individuals to be blacklisted , to prevent them from borrowing large sums of money from wealthy countries . #% Secondly , with regard to the question of junior doctors in training , it was unfortunate that when the original working time directive was proposed by the Commission , this sector was excluded . #% I mention , in particular , those under the Leader Programme . #% The only way , in my view , in which you can demonstrate your commitment is to extract the ` country of origin ' principle , which directly attacks the European social model and which directly attacks the solidarity and approach to the development of a European single market . #% Mr President , I was there in Lisbon , representing Parliament when the Energy Charter Treaty was signed . #% It is a moderate approach which can be stepped up or cancelled when progress is made by Israel in withdrawing her troops from the Palestinian area , giving free access to humanitarian aid and free access to the United Nations mission in Jenin and elsewhere . #% With regard to energy efficiency , it is absolutely regrettable that the Council has not supported Parliament and the Commission on the SAVE II programme and that the Council has not adopted energy-efficient measures in the energy sector . #% We wish to show our solidarity with the Italian process . #% Mr President , on a point of order , may I suggest that you extend the time available for this one-minute speech ? #% I must stress firstly that Parliament , in my view , should not be under any pressure to sign up completely to the proposed first-reading text in this regard . #% This directive should be solely directed towards supporting new renewable technologies that are not yet commercially viable . #% In this regard , I support proposals for a further update of the 1997 directive with the caution that it must be done in a sensible way . #% This is at complete odds with what the Commission is trying to achieve . #% in writing . - While it is not a good idea to subsidise the fossil-fuel industry , fishermen across the EU are suffering due to the economic downturn and , unlike other modes of transport , they do not have any real alternative to fossil fuels . #% It is up to the Member States to deal with violence , whatever its origins or intent . #% I want to thank the President-in-Office for his response . #% Some mistakes were also made for political reasons . #% It is not easy for fishermen to take on board a closure of their area for such an extensive period . #% 
We need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the Green Paper and make an evidence-based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments . #% It is vital that consumer interests be protected in these areas . #% This leaves us as far away as ever from the UN target of spending 0.7 % of GNP on Overseas Development Aid , and not even in sight of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals . #% The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999 . #% It advocated the removal of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy imposed upon European farmers which , in my opinion , has become over-burdensome and seriously impinges upon the time that they would rather spend actually farming . #% There is a huge threat now to cultural diversity within the European Union because of the import of programmes from America and globalisation even of food chains like McDonalds . #% Organised criminal gangs with vast resources that are illegally trafficking human beings into the European Union can not be allowed , under any circumstances , to operate with impunity . #% I agree fully with Mr Herman . #% It is estimated by the British Government that in households where children 's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as at children and young people , children would see 41 % fewer adverts of food and drink products that are high in fat , salt and sugar . #% It came about as a partnership between the local county council , the Romanian Government and two Irish NGOs -- Focus on Romania and the Aurelia Trust . #% This is therefore something we would put down as a marker . #% Sales promotions are key tools to marketing goods and services and we need to get rid of restrictions and barriers so as to allow business and consumers to exploit the opportunities of the internal market . #% As a society built on the imperative of Marxist domination , it is no surprise that Cuba is a bastion of repression , where dissent is crushed and freedom denied . #% Lastly I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he would agree that this matter should now be raised within the UN Security Council . #% Let us be very careful about border controls in relation to importing again this horrible disease particularly to countries that are now rabies-free . #% A quota of the size demanded by Mercosur would completely undermine Ireland 's beef production . #% It allows us to recruit the new generation of scientists and technologists . #% Security cover was indeed finally provided for the second half of our mission , but it came from the provincial governors and not from the federal authorities . #% When we deal with legislation which intimately affects human health we must exercise great care and attention . #% I should like to be reassured by the Commission that the failure to establish paying agencies for Sapard in so many states for reasons which I understand will not mitigate against the carryover of funding that we have dedicated for structural agricultural reform . #% I must say , as a British citizen and , indeed , as a lawyer , that the savage experience of several British citizens abroad buttresses my view that we have little to gain but much to lose from extensive criminal justice integration . #% As John F Kennedy said in his inaugural speech ` we stand today on the edge of a new frontier , but the new frontier is not a set of promises , it is a set of challenges . ' #% It is also clear that the Government is using the pretext of the crackdown on terrorism as a means of suppressing Government opponents and critics . #% Any compromise proposals drawn up by the Irish presidency do not set a target date for the Gas Directive to come into effect nor does it give any indication of whether there would be follow-up measures . #% We looked at the world-class strength of the UK , we looked at fashion , design , IT , just-in-time techniques , and supply chains as Mr Ribeiro said , and we discovered that we can actually learn from other countries . #% This has to be of great concern as it flies in the face of the purpose of the fund . #% The number of convictions is derisory in terms of the problem ; the police do not see human trafficking as a crime . #% There are many instances in my area where maybe BSE occurred five , six or seven years ago in one animal and there has never been another case since . #% The background is that the fluorinated gases were introduced in the nineties to replace the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs . #% However , as far as our experience with the International Criminal Court is concerned , it is not yet opportune to start dismantling the current protections that exist under the United Nations Charter . #% If the Union and its institutions are to continue to develop and become stronger over the coming years , it is vital that the citizens of each of our countries continue to accept the democratic legitimacy of these institutions . #% What role does it see for Europol ? #% I support initiatives at European level which contribute to the efforts of Member States to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector . #% Of those taking part in the discussions , he was far and away the most skilful and appeared to show the most stamina . #% If we take the Barcelona process , the Middle East peace process , our relations with the Western Balkans , our relations with Russia , clearly there is a vast area of policy to be covered and a wide variety of instruments . #% The developing countries have little to gain from such a gesture ; in fact , the EU already allows free access to 50 least-developed countries as it is . #% The main concern that legislators and health teams face today with regard to breast cancer is that every woman , irrespective of her place of residence , social status , occupation and education , should have access to high-quality screening for treatment and aftercare in the event of cancer . #% Particular emphasis will be placed on setting up schemes to help the long-term unemployed as well as to help early school leavers . #% To be a credible military super power , of course , it needs a space policy . #% One of the most important elements of our work here today , and the vote in favour of the Lynne report , has been that it sends out a clear message , not just from the 15 countries of the European Union but also from the 10 accession countries , that we want to establish common standards and rules . #% in writing . - Whilst I support the rights of pregnant women , I can not , in this current economic climate , support this report . #% Is it proportionate ? #% This issue is of such importance to Ireland , especially in these economic times , that I had to vote against this proposal . #% Alongside the proposed technical improvements , I particularly welcome measures to improve the safety of persons with reduced mobility . #% There was an assumption that the outcome was a fait accompli . #% The Member States apparently lack the political will to fulfill their obligations . #% EU accession to the ECHR improves the Union 's standing when calling on third countries to abide by its human rights standards and extends to people in the EU the same level of protection against Union action that they enjoy with regard to Member State action . #% The top tier of the army , however , is deeply tied to the economic interests of the former regime and does not represent the legitimate demands and aspirations of the working people . #% I welcome very much , as others have said , that we can celebrate the success of the anti-rabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the UK , Ireland and Sweden to change their quarantine system , thereby giving us the template that the Commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the EU . #% Every means possible , including confiscation of assets , which we introduced in Ireland , must be part and parcel of an internationally agreed strategy . #% Structural funding in Ireland , however , will not come to a sudden halt at the end of 1999 . #% I feel we need a well-established recycling mentality before moving on in any direction . #% Yet where are we now ? #% This is just such a case . #% I would like to ask the President-in-Office , does he see any role now for Thiérry Larsson who made such a success of the Oslo peace agreement ? #% During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures . #% While the agricultural sector needs to be competitive and must change to take account of varying circumstances such as EU enlargement and world trading conditions , it is important to adequately compensate farmers for the price reductions this will entail . #% That is why it is important that there be a review of cooperation so that we can determine how the resources of the European Union and the Member States can best be deployed . #% The European Union and national Member States must implement programmes which take account of the ever-changing nature of employment , both in urban and rural areas . #% The Irish presidency should not allow itself to be hijacked or bullied and pressurised into ensuring that an EU constitution is pushed through during its six-month term . #% Therefore it is clearly not an easy problem to get to grips with . #% Pirate fishing can be seen as a undesirable consequence of states at last attempting to improve the management of fisheries . #% So far as the arguments against the best available technology are concerned , they do not stand up to scrutiny . #% The other point is the question of the just return . #% I would appreciate it if you would consider me as having been present when it comes to the Minutes . #% Furthermore , the shortage of medical and food aid has made deaths from these treatable diseases epidemic . #% 
I passionately support this Agreement , it is a fair and honourable one and should be wholeheartedly endorsed through both parts of Ireland . #% Important for encouraging an environmental race to the top was the agreement on the general principle that Member States can maintain or introduce stricter national measures in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty . #% Things are happening in this important field . #% The nuclear fusion budget remains the largest single area - EUR 750 million - of energy research and proposes funds allocated to the development of the next generation of fusion research . #% In 2003 , total emissions from flights into and out of the EU 25 Member States contributed 3.4 % of CO2 emissions , which was equivalent to 0.5 % of worldwide emissions in this area . #% Anything short of that would undermine the principles of CAP that , by and large , have served European farmers and consumers well . #% Members have already stressed the compatibility of incorporating strong social progress criteria in award procedures while respecting the principles of competition law and of equal treatment and non-discrimination . #% I should like to compliment Mr Cabrol on his detailed and excellent report . #% I strongly support the notion that citizens who wish to take up temporary residency outside their home country should be allowed to bring their personal motor vehicle without running into financial and administrative obstacles . #% We need a pan-European approach to the issue of scanners - airport security needs to be uniform . #% I can not be repeated often enough : in an otherwise very successful city there are pockets of enormous deprivation . #% But the standard of chicken , not only from the Far East but also from other parts of the world , is seriously questionable . #% In development , the money would go to surveillance and scientific analysis etc. , and there should also be the possibility of an audit of how the money is spent . #% I would like to emphasise also that we must do everything possible to support and encourage seafaring as a profession within the European Community itself . #% I am surprised that they continue to charge supplements to single people who sometimes simply find it difficult to afford this . #% Under EU trading rules and in the interest of food safety and consumer confidence in animal health status , annual testing is required to maintain the official TB-free status of our cattle herds . #% But we must look at the numbers involved relative to the cattle population in each country to make sense , rather than just to panic the consumer . #% Whilst there has been a downward trend in corporate tax rates in some Member States , this has been accompanied by both a widening of corporate tax bases and an improvement in the underlying company profitability . #% Perhaps you could be more specific or perhaps that is premature , but I would say this to you , the greater the number of vice-presidents , the greater the onus to ensure for the sake of balance that some would come from smaller States . #% Sadly and shamefully , the head of state of an EU member country -- President McAleese of the Republic of Ireland -- chose that 60th anniversary to launch a vicious and vindictive attack on the majority community in Northern Ireland when she shamefully equated Nazi hatred of Jews to the attitude of Protestants towards Roman Catholics . #% It was as a direct result of the horror expressed in this Parliament at those dreadful crimes that we began on the path we are still moving along now towards improving legislation for the protection of children . #% Now we get down to the real question : what has all this work been about ; what useful purpose that can this report serve now and in the future ? #% Astonishingly , the government is only now preparing to establish a coordinator for the fund , four years after its inception . #% The voluntary maximum working hours negotiated by the Irish medical organisation and our department of health is 35 hours per week averaged over their rota period of 46 hours and not more than 72 hours work continuously . #% Open markets and product mobility increase the possibility of the spread of disease . #% Mr President , once again we are seeing the same situation . #% Otherwise , we can not meet the deadline . #% I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to look particularly at the passport decision 2000/68/EEC . #% Producers need to be responsible for their own products to ensure that future products live up to a more environmentally responsible design . #% Mr President , I want to say firstly to the President of the Commission that my group will study the detail of what he has proposed to us here this evening . #% Thirdly , the whole area of sustainability , with people who are already at work given protection and certain support now to make sure that they do not lose their jobs and then have to go through the cycle of retraining and upskilling in another year or two 's time to get another job ; to maintain the existing jobs that are there . #% One area remains to be addressed and that is our knowledge of what is happening in the educational systems of these countries . #% I welcome the Langen report 's inclusion of the Environment Committee 's request that the Commission introduce a mandatory and comprehensive certification system . #% Mr President , the amendments to the main report - not the Euratom report - are not yet available . #% I feel extremely European after hearing more or less the same speech in 11 different languages , albeit with some differences of emphasis and with different views , clearly , on nuclear matters . #% Mr President , in July of this year the House expressed its grave concern over the Belgian dioxin contamination and urged the Commission to act urgently to address the whole issue of food safety . #% Accidents occur in all industries , and we have just seen an appalling train crash in the UK this week . #% The cold-blooded murder of an Irish journalist , my friend Veronica Guerin , by one of our drug barons whose identity is known but who is evading prosecution is only one recent case . #% We welcome this because we are assured that these measures can be implemented relatively quickly . #% It is quite clear that nuclear power can never be the least cost option and the least cost option must be adopted under the memorandum of understanding . #% I welcome what the Commissioner has said but I should like him to remember especially those parts of the Union that are on the periphery such as Northern Ireland . #% That raises the question , for me , of how we can expect these people to have any idea of what is happening in their coastal areas or waters . #% I think it is time we dispelled this perception because Europe , in fact , is now the main contributor to both of these programmes . #% A clear distinction is drawn between discovery and invention . #% The daily discharges from the nuclear plant at Sellafield are now estimated at nine million tonnes of nuclear waste . #% However , we are disappointed that the IGC agenda which has been contemplated at Helsinki has been limited to what has been described as the Amsterdam leftovers . #% The Italian presidency would ignore this reality at its peril . #% There is no satisfactory definition of fundamentalism , no adequate basis , no common ground . #% I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks in relation to technical conservation measures . #% We have to recognise that before we begin . #% I hope this report helps fight domestic violence in Europe . #% I hope tomorrow that we will , in a final vote , deliver a very strong message from this House into the hands of our President to respond to the challenge of Cardiff to say we have listened , we have paid attention and the ball is now firmly in the Council 's court . #% When errors or problems arise in the implementation of EU laws , not only are citizens denied their rights , but the very credibility of the EU as a law-making institution is undermined . #% While this dialogue can and does play a role in the transformation of human rights issues in China , it will only bear fruit if the European Union speaks and acts as one . #% I refer to the way in which Mr Pasty is being treated . #% We all know from our own experience that lengthy and costly litigation through the courts is losing its appeal as a means to resolve disputes . #% For far too long the Commission or the Council , holding its meetings in secret and expressing solidarity very often between themselves about these issues , have covered up what we really need to know about future policy on immigration , asylum , refugees , etc. , within the Community . #% In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies . #% We should be very careful to maintain a balance : the magazine did subsequently print my article , although not in the special nuclear edition . #% Nothing equates to the Nazi holocaust . #% This is something that certainly needs to be studied . #% Let us hope that those disagreements , in the future , will only be in the WTO , over steel or on trade . #% The European Union has a resource which we hand out without cost or charge to our fishermen , and we extend that resource through these agreements . #% The treatment of people seeking asylum in all EU Member States is absolutely appalling . #% With regard to energy , the President of the Commission has come forward with a good policy for a common energy policy in Europe , but we should also look at the alternatives , including the opportunity to use fuel crops to produce energy . #% In relation to the issue of a safe country of origin I do not think there is such a thing as a safe country anywhere . #% 
I welcome the fact that he has made unemployment and sound money his priorities . #% However , it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve . #% It is time the European Union got its act together and made it clear that we will not stand for the kind of actions that have been taken in relation to Iraq , that we will unite to put in place serious peaceful conflict-prevention mechanisms to achieve what the world needs , that is , stability and peace . #% Mr President , on behalf of the Environment Committee , I welcome Mr Maat 's excellent report . #% Sometimes , but rarely , there can be genuine reasons for delayed transposition of a directive and the nitrates directive has come in for particular mention in this regard here today . #% My group , the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , and I will be giving our full support to Mr Barroso 's nomination and we hope other Members will do so well . #% The long-term development of the poorest nation in the western hemisphere must become a priority . #% We are one of the few Member States making massive provisions for future pensions . #% We call on everybody who has any influence or power over his captors to do all they can to secure his release . #% The fact that it now has attracted a democratic mandate does not alter or dilute its terrorist persona . #% The sanctions constitute relentless lethal force , and innocent Iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price . #% Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner , and the rapporteur for his report . #% The fundamental problem when we give mixed messages or perhaps poorly expressed or ill-judged messages is that we risk conveying the wrong message . #% Mr President , there is also one matter I would like to raise , and that is the relationship of drugs to this problem . #% The lack of harmonised enforcement rules means that counterfeiting is a low-risk business where for a low investment counterfeiting pirates are guaranteed enormous profits . #% A study that was carried out in Ireland just recently and published yesterday by SIPTU , a trade union organization , and by IBEC , representing business interests , shows quite clearly that between # 15 and # 17 will be added on to the cost of an airline ticket for the average traveller . #% The IND/DEM Group was simply skipped . #% Turning to Morocco , the Greens will be voting against this proposal , not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work , but because we oppose this particular package . #% Mr President , important as this debate is , it pales into insignificance when compared with the atrocious terrorist attacks in my capital city today . #% Madam President , you will be aware that I raised the issue at the Bureau last week about a grossly intimidatory and intrusive demonstration in front of the Parliament in Brussels , so I was equally surprised yesterday to see exactly the same thing happening again . #% At the moment they only label 50 % of their beef , yet they want to insist on compulsory labelling under category for all of us . #% I must remind the House and members of the Convention that the Convention is a consultative process - the real decisions should and must be made by the Council of Ministers . #% The observation is that we should not make the best the enemy of the good , which is to say that there are many here who would like to promote the CO2 tax , but it has run aground on the unanimity requirements of Article 99 . #% When it comes to shipbuilding itself , I also think that we need to look at what kind of shipbuilding takes place . #% That is the reality as far as I see it . #% This proposal is more likely to create psychological problems throughout the European Union in rural areas than real problems . #% Every year over ECU 1 billion of taxpayers ' money is going to subsidize something which is detrimental to public health and which has a detrimental effect in countries around the world where there is no proper regulation to ensure that smokers are aware of the dangers of smoking . #% ICBAN -- one of the longest established funding bodies has through its make-up become unbalanced . #% Many in my own group have raised this question with me . #% This relates to specifically named companies . #% I am sure that the Irish government has agreed to the broad principle of the separation of infrastructure and operation and has pledged to pursue the restructuring of Irish railways to achieve this goal . #% As one of the terms of EU membership , each state surrenders control of trade policy to Brussels so that no Member State can independently negotiate trade agreements with any country anywhere in the world . #% I did not go myself , but I have had very shocking reports of it from fellow Members of this House . #% We must reaffirm this message at every opportunity . #% Similarly , there are tens of thousands of unpaid carers whom we should be supporting for the valuable work they are doing , but whom your government treats like Oliver Twist asking for more . #% As Mr Bertens said , Parliament supports the initiatives taken by the eight countries in the New Agenda Coalition . #% Apparently , a contract has been signed by a new travel agency to replace Wagonlit . #% I know we have the ` push system ' and the ` pull system ' and so on , but what kind of criteria are laid down for the use of the data ? #% Despite considerable advantages in using renewable energy sources , consumption remains at below 6 % in the Union . #% Europe must protect regions like the west and north-west of Ireland , particularly as regards the settlement pattern , which can only be sustained by balanced regional development . #% Last week members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had an opportunity to have an exchange of views with the director of the Dublin Foundation and the report before us clearly shows that the Dublin Foundation is managed carefully . #% Finally , partnership is a key priority for Parliament in ensuring that the Europe we build and its policies are genuinely inclusive , supporting a People 's Europe . #% Thankfully , we have now come to the point where we can afford to cast our attention towards more ambitious goals . #% I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level . #% We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for carers , including carers looking after two or more people . #% Mr President , notwithstanding the fact that Agenda 2000 has set the parameters governing agriculture for the period up to 2006 , the annual price package is still very important . #% These instruments are in the spirit of that agreement , which should be continued . #% We must not facilitate that process . #% What will the European Community do to help the Chaldean , Assyrian and Orthodox Christian communities ? #% Mr President , I was in Parliament in the summer of 1995 when the appalling crimes of Mr Dutroux were exposed . #% I am happy to say that it is not the only consideration , because lots of us use the post and would like it to be delivered each day rather than just once a week . #% Our big challenge now is to implement the REACH regulation in our respective countries to ensure that it gets proper representation for those who send us here . #% However , derogations should only be made on a case-by-case basis so the risk of importing diseases is not increased . #% It is not and can not be ! #% Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before . #% We must ensure that when we hand down our countries and our continent to future generations , they are in a better condition than they were in when we inherited them . #% To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable . #% I support Mr Lange and congratulate him on his report . #% I believe , with your help , particularly when we have dealt with many of the sensitive political controversies of recent months and the Conference of Presidents , we have been able to hold together , with the stresses and strains and points of emphasis that groups may wish to bring to debates , a coherent parliamentary view . #% So there is a very large market to be satisfied . #% However , there is clearly a role for the EU , to assist Member States ' agencies in sharing models of best practice and ensuring a level of consistency throughout the European Union . #% It will not be an acceptable excuse that we halt the march to Union by sacrificing important principles in order to keep some or other blocking Member State on board . #% The President of the Commission pointed out that the parts of the structural funds not being spent are an embarrassment since we need greater investment to create more employment . #% The document should therefore command a consensus if it is an accurate reflection of these views . #% I welcome the fact that a fundamental basis for this negotiation is a strengthening and deepening of political dialogue , an element which had been largely missing in the previous discussions . #% They also have an obligation to the McCartney family , who have a right to expect justice for the murder of Robert . #% 
I also endorse those amendments that exclude from the scope of this directive any cells or tissues that are derived from cloned material . #% Finally , I would urge that it is important that some of the undertakings by Member States to include renewables in the energy mix in the electricity sector be at least equal to the total EU commitment made in the White Paper on renewable energy , as endorsed by the Council and this Parliament . #% However , many elements of the report which we are now considering , not through any fault of the rapporteur , are unacceptable . #% There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered . #% However , we believe it is important not to delay the implementation of the programme , otherwise much important work could not take place . #% In Zambia 25 % of teachers have died of AIDS . #% If this vote had been taken before the elections I am sure the vote would have been somewhat different . #% If there was simple control on access and more passwords on computers themselves , then parents , schools and others would have greater control . #% I do not actually think that it is necessary to take any money from agriculture in order to finance a decent programme within the amounts of money set out - EUR 5.5 billion - considering what the obligations of the Union are , what the Member States will put up and what is likely to be called upon because of the situation in Serbia . #% We have grasped the need to rectify our lack - by means of patent protection , mapping of areas of excellence , tax incentives for research and development , an electronic network for scientists and enhanced mobility for our researchers . #% Biodiversity and sustainable development will not happen if they are planned out of the equation . #% In this day and age , when there is so much EU regulation concerning the governance of financial investments , this is simply an intolerable and unacceptable situation . #% Mr President , the Agenda 2000 negotiations now under way are among the most difficult which the European Union has faced as an institution and political entity since the foundation of the European Economic Community . #% There is a Council of Europe Convention on au pairs but very few countries have signed . #% It remains to be seen in the analysis of the votes whether this objective has been achieved . #% Like the rapporteur , I welcome the Commission scoreboard to measure the state of implementation of the action plan for the single market . #% Naturally there is need for close , transparent cooperation between the NRAs and the Commission . #% Mr Prodi has said that it is not simply an assembly of disparate ideas and indeed he has offered some priorities here . #% It does not work that way ; we can not make that happen ; that is one of the great misunderstandings . #% There will continue to be areas of need in the UK post-2006 and we would like the Commission to assess the role that both a safety net mechanism and transitional funding could play in assisting poorer regions of the UK post-2006 . #% Indeed they are benefiting from providing euro slot machines for public authorities even though Britain is not in the euro zone . #% Two years ago almost to the day , I stated in this House that decisions and objectives of fish recovery plans can not disregard the social and economic consequences they will have . #% The European Union is at the forefront in protecting and upholding the human rights of all its citizens . #% It is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey . #% Clothing and footwear companies suffer the greatest losses and consumers are the victims . #% It is particularly important in the medical field where there are serious health and safety issues should patients be unable to communicate with the doctor in their own language . #% What we now need to see is the practical and rapid implementation of these action plans . #% It is important to stress that digitalisation must only be accepted when the rights of the stakeholders , including authors , publishers , illustrators , graphic designers and literary translators , are represented and protected . #% Many pharmaceutical companies have been spending up to 25 % of the research budget in defending their products . #% However welcome some of these developments may be , more needs to be done . #% We now have a growing phenomenon of so-called data streaming - hacking into computer systems and stealing credit card details in bulk . #% If it is not watertight it means that certain countries will find ways of carrying out nuclear experiments and producing absurd arguments about how they are essential for world peace , just as Mr Chirac did during the debate on the French testing in Mururoa last year . #% I would like to raise a couple of issues with you . #% The Committee on Development and Cooperation and myself have time and time again warned ECHO and the Commission that something should be done about this . #% That of course is not the fault of the rapporteur . #% Most of these young people go to a very early grave . #% Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs on this report , which adds clarity and weight to the debate . #% The challenge for Ireland and Europe will be to implement the agreed guidelines via the national reform programmes . #% This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities . #% Therefore , the tens of thousands of Greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right . #% Talk about collateral damage ! #% Mr President , the Liberal Group is deeply unhappy at the fact that we have been rail-roaded into an urgency . #% The parties must move forward . #% I believe the convention method open to the Member States , national parliaments , the Commission and perhaps ideally also to candidate states can provide a very good framework - not necessarily a single-choice menu , but a framework of rational and consistent choices - and an Intergovernmental Conference can then be invited to proceed . #% I believe that European Union airlines should not be afraid of addressing the issue of deep-vein thrombosis . #% That takes courage on both sides . #% President Barroso said here today in Parliament that climate change and energy are some of the main challenges facing the European Union over the next ten years . #% I understood that we could not be arrested in such circumstances . #% The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome . #% But if it is merely a technical slip-up , it would be a political mistake to call a Conference of Presidents for the purpose of dealing in a political organ of the House with something for which there is a perfectly reasonable technical explanation . #% Equally I welcome the fact that the new Treaty will define the powers between the European Commission itself and the individual Member States of the Union . #% The EU is supposed to be leading the way in terms of environmental change , but at the same time the reality is that we are still destroying the world 's environment and we are doing it on a daily basis : greenhouse gas emission levels , for example , are being ignored by many EU countries , including , sadly , my own country . #% The Environment Committee of the European Parliament will continue to play an important co-ordinating role in this regard . #% . Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Modrow , for taking the initiative to produce a report on this important subject . #% Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down . #% Precarious work is not only a major cause of the gender pay gap between women and men , but also creates an obstacle to career prospects leading to better jobs and professional development , trapping many in low paid insecure work . #% The sixth VAT Directive , which was originally designed to allow the abolition of tax frontiers and the creation of a common tax system , is a very important political message , particularly now when we speak about a market of 340 million people . #% Everyone accepts now that there is a problem of cod stocks . #% Sound economics , realism and results are what citizens are demanding and what are needed to continue to build the European project . #% The popular acceptance of non-conventional medicines is a fact of life . #% Can we be assured that the legal sanctions against these crimes will operate openly and effectively ? #% We have nothing else to replace DDT to eliminate malaria and the mosquito involved . #% Madam President , Indonesia is an area of the world that has been criticized many times in this Parliament , particularly because of East Timor . #% We chose to abstain and this requires explanation . #% Mr President , I would like to welcome and endorse my colleague , Mr Linkohr 's report , particularly his comments on the involvement of Parliament and on the evolution of European Union democratic structures . #% Would she also agree , under those circumstances , that there is not the slightest economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant , let alone for seeking to expand its nuclear operations into the future , and that , indeed , the plant should be closed ? #% 
That would be the best Christmas box that both the Commission and Council could give the citizens of Europe . #% That is a separate question but I can assure the Member that Ireland has not experienced any difficulties in this regard . #% Equally , there are different concerns from the perspectives of different Member State governments within the Union . #% In summary , colleagues , as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism I recognise the desirability of developing a single market in rail-service provision and the potential benefits for the consumer . #% This will allow further innovation and development of alternative technologies with regard to air conditioning systems . #% This is a very serious disease that we need to get control of this summer . #% on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , two months ago , I co-chaired the delegation under the ACP to Haiti and this was probably one of the greatest and most moving experiences of my life . #% As there was only a single vote available to us , I could not register my concern on the ` harmonisation ' proposal separate to the final vote . #% Mr President , first of all I want to be associated very much with the words of sympathy expressed with the people of Galicia and I fully concur with the speakers and my colleagues who called for solidarity with them at this time . #% There has also been increased rigour in the reporting of BSE and increased surveillance generally with new testing regimes . #% Given that xenophobia and racism is often evident at sporting events , would the President-in-Office consider , as part of the plan , using sport as a way to fight xenophobia ? #% However , any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced . #% We have heard from all the petitioners of the disasters suffered by individuals . #% This qualified me for the blind person 's pension and to be registered for blind in Ireland . #% The American model is obviously an attractive template . #% I hope we will not be looking back in a year 's time at another 100 000 dead . #% Mr President , we can write all we like about human rights and we can report and discuss the issue , but unless we follow through on our intentions and the reports , they are meaningless . #% Detainees have been subjected to brutal and inhumane torture and often prevented from contacting their families and lawyers . #% Unfortunately , the report does not compare projects for effectiveness , nor does it set down the criteria on which projects are or should be assessed . #% It is very clear to me that the Northern Ireland Agreement has to be accepted in its entirety ; there is no question of cherrypicking . #% I note what he says about the intensive bilateral negotiations currently taking place between Germany and the UK and , indeed , I believe France over emissions . #% Some estimates have suggested that at least half of the hundreds of the Palestinians killed have been civilians . #% There are few areas where our policy pretensions and our actual effort stand in starker contrast than in the area of common foreign and security policy . #% I have in my hand a letter from the Finance Minister in my region which admits that EU funds acquired for Northern Ireland are diverted instead directly into the UK central Exchequer and are thereby used to reduce the level of UK-wide taxation and borrowing that is then necessary . #% The Commission , Council and Parliament know what needs to be in a framework document of that kind . #% The UK Presidency has been very cooperative and has taken on board many of Parliament 's amendments , which allows us now to vote on this first reading package of the general enacting terms of the European payment order . #% I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain . #% The fact remains that the food industry in the EU is protein deficient . #% I trust that all governments will be urged to accept that necessity . #% The European Union works at its best when Parliament , the Commission and the Council are working closely together on the implementation of various EU regulations and directives . #% I will comment on just one of them , namely your determination to complete the single market in the gas and electricity sectors . #% Mr President , when we talk about human rights abuses around the world we have to look to ourselves and see what we are responsible for . #% But what we disagree with in this report is the way that it has emerged from the committee . #% The presidency agrees with the honourable Member that this is an important issue . #% in writing . - Planning for the 2011 budget is very important and I agree with the report 's call for a carefully considered and transparent discussion . #% The ` Lisbon strategy ' of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 may have failed , but this does not mean we should abandon it entirely . #% Would not an opinion have sufficed , given the very heavy political fall-out from the recommendation in Ireland , where we are in an election year and very likely face a referendum on Nice , this episode has been oats to the eurosceptics . #% World Bank researchers predict that , in 2010 alone , 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it , in 2009 , between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition . #% Covering the period between 2007 and 2013 , the EU has at its disposal a budget of almost EUR 17 billion to combat poverty , to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to promote democratic governance in developing countries . #% The Commission is aware that Member States deploy diverse goals and objectives for national and regional aid policy . #% Now is the time to set out a comprehensive strategy to address the situation in relation to the future . #% The welfare of our animals deserves regulation that is based on best scientific practice . #% In relation to the first part of his question , the country that has not signed is Belgium . #% Industry must be given long-term certainty . #% In a house that obsesses with green policy , some choose to needlessly pump 20 000 tonnes of carbon monoxide into the environment . #% Is it in a position to prove its credentials in fighting international terrorism , or is it only interested in ducking its responsibility ? #% The bottom line is that some countries are running up serious budget deficits , which is clearly in breach of EMU criteria . #% In trade agreements with China and other countries we always have human rights clauses , but we are so timid about the implementation of them that they might as well not be there . #% I do not know whether you have ever heard it described in that way : it is my personal description of the problem . #% However , we will still ensure that workers exposed to optical radiation will be fully protected and that their health and safety will be looked after . #% Under this legislation local authorities are required to prepare waste management plans either individually or jointly and the Environment Protection Agency is also required to prepare a national hazardous waste management plan . #% I hope we will be in a position to help Robert 's family if the necessity arises , if none of the witnesses , nor indeed the IRA or Sinn Féin themselves , are brave and honourable enough to supply to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or the Ombudsman the information necessary to institute criminal proceedings . #% We will not vote until we have had a statement from the Commission , because of the very strange procedure being adopted . #% Mr President , if I had an hour instead of a minute I could maybe touch on some of the key points , however , in the European Parliament we have to work within these limits . #% I would like to ask why a Commissioner would presume to speak in this manner in direct conflict with agreements that have already been signed and why she should presume to overstep subsidiarity in speaking on behalf of my country . #% They ensure that there is equality between all the Member States and help us to guarantee that we can move forward within a framework suitable for further building and a more efficient operation of the Union as we enlarge even further . #% How then will we feed the people of Europe ? #% Add to this the fact that 50 % of AIDS patients in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV/AIDS is rife will develop TB , and we can see how lucky we are to be in the relatively controlled immunised area , having programmes such as we do . #% Mr President , the ever-increasing threat from terrorist organisations , and the greater concentration of terror in the murdering of public figures , with the recent hideous murder of one of the Netherlands ' leading politicians , make this matter one of vital importance today to Parliament . #% Let us not hand out kudos to a company whose industrial relations practices are unjust and whose profits are built on the generosity of their employees . #% I support this resolution . #% I hope , the next time this issue comes back to the UN , that Member States will put principle above trading interests . #% Finally , I want to congratulate Mr Howitt on doing an excellent job this year under new and different circumstances . #% I wish to thank the Prime Minister for his contribution here this morning . #% Unlike some other speakers , I consider it necessary and timely . #% We must refuse to accept as legitimate any outcome of the national convention unless the conditions set down last year by the ASEM Ministers are met . #% 
I take note of that fact that as he talked about Europe 's profile in the world he referred to enlargement and mentioned that enlargement will move the epicentre of the European Union towards the east . #% But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union . #% Arising from what Mr Macartney raised concerning the Norwegian salmon deal and taking into account its serious implications right across the EU , could you explain to me how , as Members , we could raise that matter and sound the alarm in this House . #% This is all about profit and greed . #% I welcome the presence of the Commissioner and want to say we were proud and a little sad to note that she worked herself into the ground before Christmas on fishing problems . #% It was an irresponsible amendment which seeks to maintain Regulations ( EC ) Nos 2847/93 and 685/95 for a period of 10 years . #% In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse . #% Since then , there has been such intimidation within the community that it has resulted in silence : people live in fear of reprisals if they speak out . #% It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the application of the arrangements in any particular case or cases , or by any individual Member State . #% In an increasingly globalised business environment , the arrival of the SE is timely . #% They need regional structures with real development power , real decision-making powers for the regions . #% There is a depth of knowledge within the European Union , amongst people between the ages of 45 and 60 , that is going untapped , a resource that is being lost because of ignorance , because of a lack of innovative thinking or simply because of a lack of a properly-structured training programme to allow them to adapt to the new market forces and employment opportunities available . #% We have the third highest accident rate in the European Union and we have the highest fatality rate in the European Union . #% Commissioner , we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented . #% The central nervous system bioeffects - which the Commission does not refer to - seem to be occurring where mobile phone masts are located close to people 's homes . #% So it is quite ridiculous for Members in this House to argue that this inquiry should not proceed . #% Something needs to be done or we will have no clothing , footwear and such labour-intensive industries . #% Yesterday , listening to Commissioner Monti , I became convinced by his reassurances that the ethics committee in relation to biotechnology will be a serious one with which we as a Parliament can interact on a regular basis . #% His years of experience and expertise in this field make him eminently qualified to deal with such an important matter . #% I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues , such as the possible existence of ` black sites ' in EU Member States . #% We can now seek to amend this proposal by referring it back to the Development Committee , and I very much appreciate the work done by the Presidency and those in the Commission who proposed a new draft . #% Some years ago I saw how parlous the state of the equipment was , particularly scientific equipment , in many of the countries that have been helped . #% It was very disappointing to see so many people in this Parliament not support an amendment that would have given people some sort of protection in relation to protecting their basic civil liberties . #% They are also concerned about the greed of many of the sporting organizations involved here . #% It is estimated that around 20 000 young Africans have been brought to Europe to play football but now live in the EU illegally because they did not secure a career as a football player . #% The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water , coastal water , internal waste and ground water now and into the future . #% The current UN Conventions set out clear guidelines for all countries to apply their own national law and enforcement procedures . #% They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen . #% Mr President , I have two items of information . #% I should just like to take this opportunity , while expressing my appreciation of our Ombudsman 's work , to raise also the issue of the need for a special children 's Ombudsman in Europe . #% They lay down their whiskies to age for up to 12 to 20 years . #% This should also include the legal recognition of electronic signatures , and certification services are needed to cope with this development . #% Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliament 's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices . #% To my mind that seems to contradict what they are saying in this debate . #% He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration . #% It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States . #% By far the worst , of course , and not surprising , is Spain with 116 vessels , but of course they are not alone . #% In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since 2005 has already repossessed 30 homes . #% Rural depopulation is rife , in spite of all the rural development measures . #% Over 70 000 Sri Lankans have died in this conflict since 1973 and any initiative to prevent further loss of life would be very worthwhile . #% Of course , there is also a knock-on effect in terms of impact and job creation and in population retention in rural areas . #% It has been agreed to accept the recommendations of the Scientific Committee as the basis for all decisions on the public health aspect of food production . #% The EU monitoring and advocacy programme of the Open Society Institute has stated that there is a total absence of reliable , comprehensive data on mentally disabled persons in Romania , which has contributed to a general lack of public attention to people with intellectual disabilities . #% Where we diverge somewhat , is with regard to what should actually be in that final resolution and draft Statute . #% I regret that the European Council , while giving political support to President Santer 's proposed confidence pact for employment , failed to agree on the more important questions of funding the measures proposed by the Commission President , thereby ignoring the 18 million European citizens who had been led to place their hopes and trust in the outcome of the Florence Summit . #% The International Fund , as has been said here , has played a very positive role in the quest for a lasting and peaceful settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict . #% Prices collapse , there is terrible hardship and indeed terrible profiteering by middlemen . #% This trial has been carefully watched internationally and if there is a negative verdict it will undoubtedly be a miscarriage of justice . #% In particular , this is the case for Open Source and the Open Source movement that has been so successful in recent years . #% If EU Structural Funds are going to be applied for the desired purpose , namely to improve the economic and social cohesion of different regions , then these monies must be spent as additional financial resources . #% The cheap smuggled tobacco has produced new smokers among the young people in the United Kingdom . #% Naturally , Parliament put forward its own proposals to support the right of doctors in training to be covered by this directive after a period of 4 years . #% It is time for this place - MEPs , the Commission and officials - to get real . #% That undermines the credibility of the overall EMU framework . #% I am very disappointed that this very important issue is not further up the agenda . #% Let us hope that our resolution will bring some justice to these people , will help them re-settle in their homelands and achieve some results . #% The Irish Sea must not be used as a soft option for the disposal of radioactive nuclear materials by BNFL . #% The OECD has estimated that in the 1990s governments in Europe transferred about EUR 300 billion of public-service property to private operators , in some cases with disastrous results in terms of both service provision and , indeed , loss of life . #% I say that with deep regret . #% They were extremely courteous . #% I know that the President-in-Office spent some time last month discussing this matter very widely . #% This House has demanded urgency on a statute for its own Members ; it must treat its own staff with no less urgent respect . #% We have faced up to the importance of food security and food quality and we must also ensure that our consumers are fully protected in the broader world trade . #% The situation changed again in September 1998 with the elections and change of government , so the application has been reactivated and is before us again this evening . #% I know things must change and I know we have to be prepared for that change , but it has to be for the better . #% Addressing educational disadvantage by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support , and by promoting inclusive education , are absolutely necessary to create a truly inclusive society . #% 
Cedefop provides policy makers , researchers and practitioners with information to promote a clearer understanding of developments in vocational training and thus enable them to take informed decisions for future action . #% I would urge the Commission to monitor progress and to formulate a cohesive policy involving all actors in the process of production and supply of biomass and biofuels . #% I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban . #% On a related issue , it is important to note that some concerns had been expressed that the applicant countries would have been able to export food products which were not up to current EU food safety standards . #% They will not thank us then for a headline-grabbing , ego-satisfying deal at the WTO if we have cut off from ourselves a secure supply of reliable food that is home-produced . #% Leaders of the 25 governments of the European Union meeting in Brussels later this week will formally give the go-ahead -- or not -- to accession negotiations between the European Union and the Turkish Government . #% Otherwise we may as well hand over the monopoly of food production to large multinational corporations , which would be a very anti-social development indeed . #% His statement is totally irrelevant to the true situation that emerged . #% Would you now take steps to bar all air transport of radioactive material until the new IAEA guidelines can be urgently revised to incorporate the International Civil Aviation Organization 's own guidelines and requirements , because so far they have not taken them into consideration ? #% We can not inhabit the weird minds of terrorists , but we can pay the high cost of protection . #% Commissioner Borg , this report and this Parliament are calling on you to consider a new Community initiative for this important sector of activity . #% I welcome the resolution calling for the settling of differences between the two trading blocs over issues such as the visa waiver and PNR . #% We need stability and we need to get down to the business of policy as quickly as possible . #% By tackling climate change in a serious manner , we not only help to preserve our planet for our grandchildren and future generations , but we would also save them and ourselves monetary cost , given that the climate change costs incurred as we aim to protect disappearing species and habitats are very high . #% The recent publication of the Santer package of proposals has clearly shown that the existing Member States will have to take difficult decisions concerning the size of the European budget and the future operation both of the Structural Funds and of the common agricultural policy in order to prepare for enlargement . #% What Mrs McKenna said about Wicklow County Council is absolutely true . #% This is ridiculous : a war is being waged against voiceless children basically because the United States , and indeed the British , are supporting this kind of inhumanity to their fellow man . #% Therefore , I was glad to see that amendments that mention ` soil moisture balance ' and ` field capacity days ' were passed at committee level . #% I think this is a major cause for concern , since the regulators have miscalculated . #% I believe that Dublin should provide us with a separate and comprehensive statement of the European Council strategy to strengthen the fight for growth and employment . #% All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own . #% So I will actively look for the Commission to pursue a different strategy , because I believe that the State aid map is out of date . #% It could well be that this directive is insufficiently ambitious and that it should also apply to much smaller surface areas . #% In April the Commission officials put forward a series of proposals which would allow a level of openness of 95 % , a significant improvement on previous European proposals . #% If we had done that , Mr Wynn 's control and recovery would be less of a problem . #% This is the kind of legislative proposal that has to stop . #% In this report my group has pledged its support for EMU . #% My apologies - I got held up in traffic . #% It could give a lead in trying to do this and I hope that when they meet next week the leaders of our groups will seek to put in place some mechanism to enable Parliament to address this matter . #% The differences in standards have also contributed to public anxieties - consumers wonder why their countries have a different limit to another country . #% author . - Mr President , I initiated this urgency resolution in order to exert political and public pressure on getting the EU peacekeeping mission to the eastern Chad border region deployed as soon as possible . #% I would welcome some opportunity to discuss this matter of local development and the contribution it can make , not just to employment creation , but also to tackling social injustice throughout the European Union more generally . #% We reject the view that according any person whose extradition is sought their rights under law is tantamount to an implicit or explicit support of terrorism . #% Mr President , I understand the need to maintain the integrity of the telecoms package , but I understand there have been some final changes to the declaration the Commission has issued on ` must carry ' rules . #% There are specific criteria that we would like to follow . #% Indeed , Sinn Féin , by its continued integral link with the IRA , is just as guilty , in spite of its claims . #% in writing . - The cultural dimensions of EU external actions should not be overstated , and it is important that Commissioner Ashton continues to build this into her work with the EEAS . #% Mr Parish ' s report is very timely , and the study on `` The Future of Young Farmers in the European Union '' by independent consultants which was commissioned at his request at the beginning of last year provides a much-needed focus on the whole issue . #% There is a growing awareness in Europe of the dimensions of the threat from the very well-resourced , very well-targeted United States of America . #% Their first need is to be safe . #% Future waste disposal in Ireland does not and can not rely on the continued search for landfill sites by local authorities up and down the country . #% We risked this acceleration and creation of cartels . #% I voted in favour of Mr Goodwill 's report on the basis that it will help to further protect the environment . #% It concluded that EMU participation by Ireland would yield a net benefit for the Irish economy in these sectors . #% Some time ago , a EUR 2.5 billion commitment to Honduras for reconstruction after Hurricane Mitch was barely delivered on to the extent of one-third of that commitment : this is totally unacceptable . #% It is a fairly simple idea , but it one which would , in my view , generate a lot of interest amongst the citizens of Europe . #% We want to show solidarity with the people of Eastern Europe and to give them the cohesion funds and agricultural funds that we ourselves received . #% Increasing security , logistical and bureaucracy problems have been identified by the NGOs on the ground as hampering aid and making a disastrous situation worse . #% We hear much about the privileged treatment given to asylum seekers and I hope we will hear no more of this . #% The fact of the matter is that the greater the reduction of greenhouse gases , the greater the effect it has on climatic change which in turn will have a devastating effect on coastal communities and island communities , not only in Europe but world-wide . #% Madam President , my group does not have a copy of this amendment , nor does it exist in the actual amendments which have been tabled . #% This is primarily the case because of the disastrous environmental damage that was caused as a result of the Erika tanker sinking of the coast of France a couple of years ago . #% I am sure that Mr Seal and his colleagues have noted this position . #% I know there are rules governing such a situation but nonetheless , because of the scandalous reports coming from Bosnia and because of the visit and the fact that Parliament will be in recess for the month of August , it is of vital importance that the Commission give some account of the circumstances which appear to have occurred in Bosnia . #% She has been a great asset to the Community and a great source of support on issues that have very often been discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs . #% The Stability Pact for the EMU , brokered in Dublin , is not something to be joyful about , although furthering the battle against unemployment was a stated objective of the Irish presidency . #% Secondly , we already know that the vote which we are about to take in favour of the Commission 's proposal has , in fact , has already been bypassed by a political understanding in Ecofin . #% What more can one add ? #% Given the strong ties which exist between my own Member State and India , I am naturally keen that the EU does all in its power to help India realise its enormous potential for economic development . #% Madam President , this afternoon we have heard three very important statements on the core issue of this particular debate - one by the Council , one by the Commission and one by the chief observer on the European Union mission , who was officially representing the three institutions during the election itself . #% Mr President , when you look at the list of threats to marine biodiversity , overfishing is the first problem that is mentioned . #% Hopefully we can find a way to do that . #% I ruled nothing in , and I ruled nothing out : the matter is still under examination . #% No veterinary medicinal product can be used in food-producing animals unless maximum residue limits , MRLs , are set up for its active substances . #% I do not think it is reasonable to inform the people of Europe that there was a loss of EUR 14 million to the European budget arising out of this case . #% Let us proceed to a vote and let us vote for a statute . #% 
It is important that Member States can decide to establish a well-defined system of prior authorisation for reimbursement of costs of hospital or specialised care . #% From an Irish point of view it is essential that this funding continue after the year 2000 and up to the year 2006 . #% There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad . #% It is a prototype for a much more far-reaching arrangement than the present one . #% For that reason , it should be our primary objective now , as we enter the new century and the new millennium , to do all in our power to ensure that Iraq is the last war in the history of the world . #% I therefore hope that our suggestion will ensure that we are able to have both openness and good management of each individual part of the programmes . #% on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and the Commission for its contribution this evening . #% We also need to look at how people are educated . #% Third , and most important , there is still no known case of transmission from human being to human being . #% It is deeply regrettable that for many transport users in Ireland , as I am sure in other Member States , this is a measure that has simply come too late . #% But it is up to Member States , if they wish to respond to the Council proposal , to put forward their reaction for other Member States to consider and for the Commission to react to . #% We have far too many examples right across Europe of private money corrupting politics and the regulators . #% The Commission ' s communication on strengthening environmental integration within Community energy policy is very welcome in view of its realistic approach to the question . #% But we also hear of new fears , because Afghanistan has a brutal history and the brutality was not just the work of the Taliban . #% We need to have an illustrative renewables programme to counterbalance the illustrative nuclear programme which is produced . #% The uncoordinated and therefore ineffective response of the EU to the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo was a serious embarrassment . #% Firstly , a strong social partnership model whereby all the actors at a national level are involved in determining broad economic policy , as well as social policy . #% Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Coveney for his extremely comprehensive and well written report . #% We must all play our part in guaranteeing that international terrorism is defeated . #% in writing . - At a time when the Commission , and indeed this Parliament , ought to be searching for , and bringing forward , proposals on how to save money , we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework . #% Mr President , I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Queiró on an excellent piece of work . #% Mr Aigner , as chairman , fought to have it made a full committee and he also fought to get a Court of Auditors , which we succeeded in getting . #% We all have to condemn the assassinations that took place in Papua on 10 November . #% Indeed I welcome the presence this morning of President Barroso on this important issue . #% I would like to see more money for research but there is no bottomless bank account . #% Enforcement of the rules is the key . #% Indeed , it appears that while Dell was closing its manufacturing plant in Ireland , it received $ 54.5 million in State aid from the Polish Government to open a new plant in Lodz . #% Ignoring this problem and not providing the facilities and treatment that are needed costs Europe three to four per cent of our GDP per year . #% If Seville shows some generosity from our political leaders , our citizens will emulate that generosity in return . #% Are we going to tell farmers that they can not engage in this legitimate trade ? #% One is that we should somehow try to legislate , or to get Member States to legislate , for the 0.7 % of GNP contribution , as required by our commitment to the United Nations . #% For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises . #% We must strengthen the clinical research capacities in developing countries . #% So , Commissioner , I want to thank you for the constructive and intensive work that you have carried out . #% Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Caudron and Commissioner Busquin for their hard work in difficult circumstances . #% In particular , I call upon the Commission to help alleviate some of the difficulties the Hungarian negotiators are facing with internal bureaucracies within the Commission and speed up that whole process . #% The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes . #% I would also like to make a request on the record now , so the message gets through , that we will be calling on the Austrian Presidency to comment tomorrow on this specifically . #% These firms knew the consequences and they should be held accountable for the complete and total cost of cleaning up the damage that they have caused wherever possible . #% The British Society for Human Genetics says : ' Article 5 appears both to permit and to exclude the patenting of human gene sequences . ' #% Why has the Commission not incorporated the full force of good practice from European case law into the body of this directive to ensure that we guarantee the highest social and economic standards in public procurement ? #% In my Member State , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities . #% Enlargement with the current restrictions on our budget would be disastrous for the new Member States and would also destroy much of the success in achieving economic and social cohesion between the existing 15 Member States . #% In remarkably similar circumstances , the failure to renew the last agreement with Morocco , which expired at the end of November 1999 , has again led to the need to seek increased fishing opportunities elsewhere in order to offset some of the hardship caused by the loss of access to Moroccan waters . #% Huge differences also exist between the theory , or the rhetoric , and practice on the ground in relation to women 's equality , the and situations . #% My opinion is that we should not be using formula anyway . #% The people of Ireland are asking if this is a foretaste of what is in store for the smaller nation in post-Convention Europe . #% Surely , in this House , we must recognise and value that principle of subsidiarity . #% We need to reform the way in which we take decisions in a broader European Community , but we also need to ensure that , in the context of putting in place a new European Union Treaty , vital national interests are protected . #% This proposal is against not only laws and constitutions , but also the conscience of millions of citizens . #% This report is a contribution to resolving problems in the inshore fishing sector , not to creating new ones . #% The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic and regional cohesion , and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions that are highly dependent on fisheries . #% The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , the International Commission of Jurists and , last night , US Congressmen have all expressed their worries over the case . #% Despite all these problems , labelling has an important role and should apply to all food products including alcoholic beverages . #% However , that social policy contributes to the quality of the labour market and the formation of social capital . #% - The political benefit to mankind of genetic research is seriously eroded by vested interests , using the technology in a manner which is not compatible with sustainable development , and every often in conflict with acceptable ethical standards . #% The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe . #% On that final point , I would like to say that the Centre for Independent Living , which is based in Ireland , is bringing a delegation from all over Europe for the second part-session here in September . #% Only in the last few days the European Consumers Association has issued a statement in this regard . #% As Members of this Parliament we fly as part of our work ; we are constantly in the air . #% But in order to finally eradicate violence and promote peace , there must be genuine willingness to enter into dialogue and to share power , and there must be an acceptance that the past can not dictate the future . #% In the past where conflicts have arisen in relation to the legal basis , the Council has always rejected the Commission 's view and has changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94 . #% The amendments are totally inappropriate . #% It concerns every single coastal Member State , in most instances in totally different ways . #% In conclusion , I am pleased that Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has recognised the need to take into account social and economic factors , such as employment in coastal areas . #% It would be very difficult to water and feed those animals unless the vehicle is equipped to make that possible . #%
